Cumulative net CO__2__ emissions of the last decade (2010-2019) are about the same size as the remaining carbon budget for keeping warming to 1.5°C

(medium confidence). Cumulative net CO2 emissions since 1850 are increasing at an accelerating rate. 62% of total cumulative CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 occurred since 1970 (1500±140 GtCO2), about 43% since 1990 (1000±90 GtCO2), and about 17% since 2010 (410±30 GtCO2). For comparison, the remaining carbon budget for keeping warming to 1.5°C with a 67% (50%) probability is about 400(500)±220 GtCO2. {2.2.2, Figure 2.7; WG1 5.5; WG1 Table 5.8}
