Globally, GDP per capita and population growth remained the strongest drivers of CO__2__ emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the last decade 

(robust evidence, high agreement). Trends since 1990 continued in the years 2010 to 2019 with GDP per capita and population growth increasing emissions by 2.3% and 1.2% yr-1, respectively. This growth outpaced the reduction in the use of energy per unit of GDP (-2% yr-1, globally) as well as improvements in the carbon intensity of energy (-0.3%yr-1). {2.4.1, Figure 2.19}
