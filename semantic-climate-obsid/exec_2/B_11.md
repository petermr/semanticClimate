Emissions from developing countries have continued to grow, starting from a low base of per capita emissions and with a lower contribution to cumulative emissions than developed countries

(robust evidence, high agreement). Average 2019 per capita CO2-FFI emissions in three developing regions - Africa (1.2 tCO2/cap), Asia and developing Pacific (4.4 tCO2/cap), and Latin America and Caribbean (2.7 tCO2/cap) - remained less than half that of developed countries (9.5 tCO2/cap) in 2019. CO2-FFI emissions in the three developing regions together grew by 26% between 2010 and 2019, compared to 260% between 1990 and 2010, while in Developed Countries emissions contracted by 9.9% between 2010-2019 and by 9.6% between 1990-2010. Historically, the three developing regions together contributed 28% to cumulative CO2-FFI emissions between 1850 and 2019, whereas Developed Countries contributed 57% and least developed countries contributed 0.4%. {2.2.3, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10}
