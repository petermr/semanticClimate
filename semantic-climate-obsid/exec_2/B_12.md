Globally, GHG emissions continued to rise across all sectors and subsectors; most rapidly in transport and industry

 (high confidence). In 2019, 34% (20 GtCO2>eq) of global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO2>eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2>eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO2>eq) from transport and 5.6% (3.3 GtCO2>eq) from buildings. Once indirect emissions from energy use are considered, the relative shares of industry and buildings emissions rise to 34% and 17%, respectively. Average annual GHG emissions growth during 2010-2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%, direct emissions only), but remained roughly constant at about 2% per year in the transport sector (high confidence). Emission growth in AFOLU is more uncertain due to the high share of CO2-LULUCF emissions. {2.4.2, Figure 2.13, Figures 2.16 to 2.21}.
