Emissions growth has varied, but persisted across all groups of greenhouse gases 

(high confidence). The average annual emission levels of the last decade (2010-2019) were higher than in any previous decade for each group of greenhouse gases (high confidence). In 2019, CO2 emissions were 45±5.5 GtCO2,2 CH4 11±3.2 GtCO2eq, N2O 2.7±1.6 GtCO2eq and fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) 1.4±0.41 GtCO2eq. Compared to 1990, the magnitude and speed of these increases differed across gases: CO2 from fossil fuel and industry (FFI) grew by 15 GtCO2eqyr-1 (67%), CH4 by 2.4 GtCO2eqyr-1(29%), F-gases by 0.97 GtCO2eqyr-1 (250%), N2O by 0.65 GtCO2eqyr-1 (33%). CO2 emissions from net land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) have shown little long-term change, with large uncertainties preventing the detection of statistically significant trends. F-gases excluded from GHG emissions inventories such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are about the same size as those included (high confidence).
