While previous WGIII assessments have discussed mitigation pathways, focus on development pathways is more recent.

The  &#8220;emissions gap&#8221;  is  understood  as  the  difference  between  the  emissions  with  NDCs  in  2030,  and  mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goals. In general, the term &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; refers to the difference between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In this report, the term refers to the gap between mitigation pledges contained in national determined contributions, and the expected outcome  of  existing  policies.  There  is  considerable  literature  on  country-level  mitigation  pathways, including  but  not  limited  to  NDCs.

Yet  perceived  or  real  conflicts  between  mitigation  and  other  Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) can impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found to have significant implications for development objectives and macroeconomic costs at country level. For example, most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1038">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1039">).

For example, policies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally conceived  and  implemented  in  the  pursuit  of  overall  societal  development  objectives,  such  as  job creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. In some countries, such  policies  are  framed  as  part  of  a  just  transition.  However,  they  can  have  major  influence  on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options, as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway &#8220;Shifting Pathways&#8221; (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1074">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1075">).

Examples in other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole economies  and  societies.  Coordinated  policy  mixes  would  need  to  coordinate  multiple  actors&#8212;individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors&#8212;to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support mitigation and adaptation. Some studies explore the risks of high complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways. {4.3,  4.3.1,  4.3.2,  4.4.2,  4.4.3,  4.4.1.7-4.4.1.10,  Figure  4.7,  Cross-Chapter  Box  5,  5.8,  Box  6.2,  8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5, Cross-Chapter Box 7, Cross-Chapter Box 12}  </span></div><div style="" id="id1215"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1216">The  literature  identifies  a  broad  set  of  enabling  conditions  that  can  both  foster  shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation, along five categories</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1218">.

Given that strengthening institutions may be a long term endeavour, it needs attention in  the  near-term.

Charting just transitions to net zero may provide a vision, which policy measures can help achieve. Though there is increasing experience with pricing carbon directly or indirectly, decision-makers might consider a broader toolbox of enablers and levers that is available in domains that have not traditionally been climate policy. {4.5, Annex II Part IV Section 11} </span></div><div style="" id="id1358"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1359">Broadening opportunities</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1360"> by focusing on development pathways and considering how to shift them: Some of the policy measures may yield rapid results, whereas other, larger transformations may take longer.

Section  4.2.6  discusses  certain  distributional implications of domestic mitigation efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections 4.2.7 and 4.3 note the  relevance  of  potential  distributional  impacts  as  an  obstacle  to  climate  action,  as  well  as  the inequitable  distribution  of  decision-making  authority.

In  all  cases,  the  reductions  are  then  estimated  on  top  of  the  resulting  emission trajectory.  Note  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  may  vary  the  approach  used  depending  on  the country. </span></div><div style="" id="id2497"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2498">Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a number of dimensions, including (i) their spatial resolution and coverage, (ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are included in the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate them, the emissions inventory (official vs. independent  inventory  data)  and  related  accounting  approaches  used  as  a  starting  point  for  the projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, etc.),  and  (v)  the  degree  to  which  individual  policies  and  their  impact  on  emissions  are  explicitly represented (Table 4.1). </span></div><div style="" id="id2506"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2507">First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging from macro-scale regions with globally comprehensive coverage to national level (4.2.2.3) and subnational and company level in a few cases (4.2.3).  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  typically  resolve  a  limited number of countries individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, but  have  poor  resolution  of  remaining  countries  or  regions,  which  are  assessed  in  aggregate  terms. Conversely, studies with high resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the global scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts to provide a composite global picture from  detailed  national  studies  (Bataille  et  al.  2016a;  Deep  Decarbonization  Pathways  Project  2015; Roelfsema et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id2545"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2546">Fourth, studies typically cover a set of scenarios, though how these scenarios are defined varies widely.

Detailed representations (such as the former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate results than compact ones (the latter example), but the set of assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be very different. </span></div><div style="" id="id2703"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2704">Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just implementing high level targets specified in policy documents and NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact on emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and policies at subnational level. In addition, in countries  with  rapidly  evolving  policy  environments,  slightly  different  cut-off  dates for the  policies considered in an emission projection can make a significant difference for the results  (Dubash et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id2711"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2712">The challenges described above are dealt with in the assessment of quantitative results in Section 4.2.2.3 by (i) comparing national studies with country-level results from global studies to understand systematic biases, (ii) comparing economy-wide emissions (incl.
