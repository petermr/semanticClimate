Coal has hitherto been the dominant energy source in China and 
has accounted for more than 70% of 
its total energy consumption for the past twenty years, falling to 
64% in 2015 (The National BIM Report 
2018). In the 13th Five Year Plan (2016-2020), for the first time 
China included the target of a national coal consumption cap of 
4.1 billion tons for 2020, as well as a goal of reducing the primary 
energy share of coal to 58% by 2020 from the level of 64% in 2015 
(The National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China 
2016).

Executive summary 
 
Accelerating climate actions and progress towards a just transition is essential to reducing climate 
risks  and  addressing  sustainable  development  priorities,  including  water,  food  and  human 
security  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  Accelerating  action  in  the  context  of  sustainable 
development involves not only expediting the pace of change (speed) but also addressing the underlying 
drivers  of  vulnerability  and  high  emissions  (quality  and  depth  of  change)  and  enabling  diverse 
communities, sectors, stakeholders, regions and cultures (scale and breadth of change) to participate in 
just, equitable and inclusive processes that improve the health and well-being of people and the planet. 
Looking at climate change from a justice perspective means placing the emphasis on a) the protection 
of vulnerable populations and low income countries from the impacts of climate change, b) mitigating 
the effects of the transformations, and c) ensuring an equitable decarbonized world {17.1.1}. 
 
While transition pathways will vary across countries, they are likely to be challenging in many 
contexts. (robust evidence, high agreement). Climate change is the result of decades of unsustainable 
production  and  consumption  patterns  (for  example  energy  production  and  land-use),  as  well  as 
governance  arrangements  and  political  economic  institutions  that  lock  in  resource-intensive 
development  patterns  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).    Reframing  development  objectives  and 
shifting development pathways towards sustainability can help transform these patterns and practices, 
allowing space for transitions to transform unsustainable systems (medium evidence, high agreement). 
{17.1.1.2}.  
 
 Sustainable development can enhance sectoral integration and social inclusion (robust evidence, 
high agreement). Inclusion merits attention because equity within and across countries is critical to 
transitions that are not simply rapid but also sustainable and just. Resource shortages, social divisions, 
inequitable distributions of wealth, poor infrastructure and limited access to advanced technologies can 
constrain the options and capacities for developing countries to achieve sustainable and just transitions 
(medium evidence, high agreement) {17.1.1.2}. 
 
Concrete actions aligning sustainable development and climate mitigation and partnerships can 
support transitions. Strengthening different stakeholders’ “response capacities” to mitigate and 
adapt  to  a  changing  climate  will  be  critical  for  a  sustainable  transition  (robust  evidence,  high 
agreement). Response capacities can be increased by means of alignment across multiple stakeholders 
at  different  levels  of  decision-making.  This  alignment  will  also  help  achieve  synergies  and  manage 
trade-offs between climate and sectoral policies by breaking down sectoral silos and overcoming the 
multiple  barriers  that  prevent  transitions  from  gaining  traction  and  gathering  momentum  (medium 
evidence, high agreement) {17.1.1.1}.  
 
Economics, psychology, governance and systems research have pointed to a range of factors that 
influence  the  speed,  scale  and  quality  of  transitions  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  Views 
nonetheless differ on how much market-correcting policies, shift preferences (economics) and shifts in 
individual and collective mindsets (psychology) and multi-level governance arrangements and inclusive 
political institutions (governance) contribute to system transitions (medium evidence, high agreement) 
{17.2}.  
 
While economics, psychology, governance and systems thinking emphasize different enablers of 
transitions, they often share a view that strengthening synergies and avoiding trade-offs between 
climate  and  sustainable  development  priorities  can  overcome  barriers  to  transitions  (medium 
evidence, high agreement). A growing body of research and evidence can show which factors in the 
views from economics, psychology, governance and systems affect how interrelationships are managed

between climate, mitigation policies and sustainable development. Greater integration between studies 
based on different methodological approaches can show how to construct an enabling environment that 
increases the feasibility and sustainability of transitions {17.2, 17.3 and 17.4}.  
 
Short-  and  long-term  studies  of  transformations  using  macroeconomic  models  and  integrated 
assessment models (IAMs) have identified synergies and trade-offs of mitigation options in the 
context of development pathways that align sustainable development and climate change (robust 
evidence, high agreement). IAMs often look at climate change mitigation and SDGs in an aggregate 
manner: supplementing this aggregate view with detail-rich studies involving SDGs can build support 
for transitions within and across countries (medium evidence, medium agreement). {17.3.2}.  
 
The impacts of climate-change mitigation and adaptation responses, are highly context-specific 
and scale-dependent. There are synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation as 
well as synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development(robust evidence, high agreement). 
A  strong  link  exists  between  sustainable  development,  vulnerability  and  climate  risks,  as  limited 
economic,  social  and  institutional  resources  often  result  in  low  adaptive  capacities  and  high 
vulnerability, especially in developing countries. Resource limitations in these countries can similarly 
weaken the capacity for climate mitigation and adaptation. The move towards climate-resilient societies 
requires  transformational  or  deep  systemic  change.  This  has  important  implications  countries’ 
sustainable development pathways (medium evidence, high agreement) {17.3.3.6}.  
 
Sectoral mitigation options present synergies with the SDGs, but there are also trade-offs, which 
can become barriers to implementation. Such trade-offs are particularly identified in relation to 
the  use  of  land  for  bioenergy  crops,  water  and  food  access,  and  competition  for  land  between 
forest or food production (robust evidence, high agreement). Many industrial mitigation options, like 
efficiency improvements, waste management and the circular economy, have synergies with the SDGs 
relating  to  access  to  food,  water  and  energy  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  The  promotion  of 
renewable energy in some industrial sectors, can imply stranded energy supply investments, which need 
to be taken into consideration (medium evidence, medium agreement). The Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Other  Land  Uses  (AFOLU)  sector  offers  many  low-cost  mitigation  options,  but  actions  aimed  at 
producing  bioenergy,  extending  food  access  and  protecting  biodiversity  can  also  create  trade-offs 
between  different  land-uses  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  Some  options  can  help  to  minimize 
these  trade-offs,  for  example,  integrated  land  management,  cross-sectoral  policies  and  efficiency 
improvements.  Lifestyle  changes,  including  dietary  changes  and  reduced  food  waste,  have  several 
synergies with climate mitigation and the SDGs (medium evidence, medium agreement). Cross-sectoral 
policies are important in avoiding trade-offs, to ensure that synergies between mitigation and SDGs are 
captured,  and  to  ensure  local  people  are  involved  in  the  development  of  new  products,  as  well  as 
production and consumption practices. There can be many synergies in urban areas between mitigation 
policies and the SDGs, but capturing these depends on the overall planning of urban structures and on 
local  integrated  policies,  where,  for  example,  affordable  housing  and  spatial  planning  as  a  climate 
mitigation measure are combined with walkable urban areas, green electrification and clean renewable 
energy. Such integrated options can also reduce the pressures on agricultural land  by reducing urban 
growth, thus improving food security. Access to  green electricity  can also support quality education 
(medium evidence, medium agreement). {17.3.3, 17.3.3.1, 17.3.3.3}. 
 
Digitalization  could  facilitate  a  fast  transition  to  sustainable  development  and  low-emission 
pathways by contributing to efficiency improvements, cross-sectoral coordination and a circular 
economy  with  new  IT  services  and  decreasing  resource  use  (low  evidence,  medium  agreement). 
Several  synergies  with  SDGs  could  emerge  in  terms  of  energy,  food  and  water  access,  health  and 
education,  as  well  as  trade-offs,  for  example,  in  relation  to  reduced  employment,  increasing  energy

demand  and  increasing  demand  for  services,  all  implying  increased  GHG  emissions.  However, 
developing countries with limited internet access and poor infrastructure could be excluded from the 
benefits of digitalization (medium evidence, medium agreement). {17.3.3}.  
 
Actions aligning sustainable development and climate mitigation and partnerships can support 
transitions. Strengthening different stakeholders’ “response capacities” to mitigate and adapt to 
a changing climate will be critical for a sustainable transition (robust evidence, high agreement). 
Response capacities can be increased by means of alignment across multiple stakeholders at different 
levels  of  decision-making.  This  alignment  will  also  help  achieve  synergies  and  manage  trade-offs 
between  climate  and  sectoral  policies  by  breaking  down  sectoral  silos  and  overcoming  the  multiple 
barriers that prevent transitions from gaining traction and gathering momentum (medium evidence, high 
agreement) {17.1.1.1}. 
 
The  landscape  of  transitions  to  sustainable  development  is  changing  rapidly,  with  multiple 
transitions  already  underway.  This  creates  the  room  to  manage  these  transitions  in  ways  that 
prioritise  the  needs  for  workers  in  vulnerable  sectors  (land,  energy)  to  secure  their  jobs  and 
maintain secure and healthy lifestyles, especially as the risks multiply for those exposed to heavy 
industrial  jobs  and  associated  outcomes  (medium  evidence,  high  agreement).  {17.3.2.3}.  A  just 
transition incorporates key principles, such as respect and dignity for vulnerable groups, the creation of 
decent jobs, social protection, employment rights, fairness in energy access and use, and social dialogue 
and  democratic  consultation  with  the  relevant  stakeholders,  while  coping  with  the  effects  of  asset-
stranding and the transition to green and clean economies (medium evidence, medium agreement). The 
economic implications of the transition will be felt especially strongly by developing countries, with 
high dependence on hydrocarbon products for revenue streams, as they will be exposed to reduced fiscal 
incomes  given  a  low  demand  for  oil  and  consequent  fall  in  oil  prices  (limited  evidence,  medium 
agreement). {17.3.2}.  
 
Countries  with  assets  that  are  at  risk  becoming  stranded  may  lack  the  relevant  resources, 
knowledge, autonomy or agency to reorientate, or to decide on the speed, scale and quality of the 
transition (limited evidence, medium agreement).  The urgency of mitigation might overshadow some 
of  the  other  priorities  related  to  the  transition,  like  climate  change  adaptation  and  its  inherent 
vulnerabilities. Consequently, the transition imperative could reduce the scope and autonomy for local 
priority-setting and could ignore the additional risks in countries with a low capacity to adapt. A just 
transition will depend on local contexts, regional priorities, the starting points of different countries in 
the transition and the speed at which they want to travel. Both mitigation and adaptation warrant urgent 
and  prompt  action  given  current  and  continuing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  associated  negative 
impacts on humanity and ecosystems. (limited evidence, medium agreement). {17.3.2}.  
 
A  wide  range  of  factors  have  been  found  to  enable  sustainability  transitions,  ranging  from 
technological innovations to shifts in markets, and from policies and governance arrangements 
to  shifts  in  belief  systems  and  market  forces  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  Many  of  these 
factors  come  together  in  a  co-evolutionary  process  that  has  unfolded  globally,  internationally  and 
locally over several decades (low evidence, high agreement). Those same conditions that may serve to 
impede the transition (i.e., organizational structure, behaviour, technological lock-in) can also ‘flip’ to 
enable both it and the framing of sustainable development policies to create a stronger basis and policy 
support (robust evidence, high agreement). It is important to note that strong shocks to these systems, 
including  accelerating  climate  change  impacts,  economic  crises  and  political  changes,  may  provide 
crucial  openings  for  accelerated  transitions  to  sustainable  systems.  For  example,  re-building  more

sustainably after an extreme event, or renewed public debate about the drivers of social and economic 
vulnerability to multiple stressors (medium evidence, medium agreement) {17.4}.  
 
Sustainable development and deep decarbonization will involve people and communities being 
connected through various means, including globally via the internet and digital technologies, in 
ways that prompt shifts in thinking and behaviour consistent with climate change goals (medium 
evidence,  medium  agreement).  Individuals  and  organizations  like  institutional  entrepreneurs  can 
function to build transformative capacity through collective action (robust evidence, high agreement), 
but  private-sector  entrepreneurs  can  also  play  an  important  role  in  fostering  and  accelerating  the 
transitions to sustainable development (robust evidence, medium agreement). Ultimately, the adoption 
of coordinated, multi-sectoral policies targeting new and rapid innovation can help national economies 
take advantage of widespread decarbonization. Green industrial policies that focus on building domestic 
supply  chains  and  capacities  can  help  states  prepare  for  the  influx  of  renewable,  CDR-methods,  or 
mechanisms for carbon capture and storage (medium evidence, medium agreement){17.4.2}.   
 
Accelerating the transition to sustainability will be enabled by explicit consideration being given 
to  the  principles  of  justice,  equality  and  fairness.  Interventions  to  promote  sustainability 
transitions  that  account  for  local  context  (including  unequal  access  to  resources,  capacity  and 
technology)  in  the  development  process  are  necessary  but  not  sufficient  in  creating  a  just 
transition (low evidence, high agreement). {17.4.6}

17.1  Introduction 

This chapter focuses on the opportunities and challenges for “accelerating the transition in the context 
of  sustainable  development.”  The  chapter  suggests  that  accelerating  transitions  in  the  context  of 
sustainable development requires more than concentrating on speed. Rather, it involves expediting the 
pace of change (speed) while also removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high emissions 
(quality and depth) and aligning the interests of different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders 
and cultures (scale and breadth). One key to enabling deep and broad transitions is integrating the views 
of different government agencies, businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in transition 
processes. Another critical driver of deep and broad transitions is engaging and empowering workers, 
youth,  women,  the  poor,  minorities  and  marginalized  stakeholders  in  just,  equitable  and  inclusive 
processes. The result of such processes will be the transformation of large-scale socioeconomic systems 
to restore the health and well-being of the planet and the people on it.   

Section  17.1  begins  by  reviewing  how  climate  and  sustainability  issues  have  been  discussed  in  the 
Intergovernmental  Process  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  as  well  as  international  climate  change  and 
sustainable development processes at different levels. It further introduces key themes addressed in the 
chapter’s remaining subsections. Section 17.2 provides an overview of how key theories understand 
transitions  and  transformation,  and  notes  a  shared  concern  over  leveraging  synergies  and  managing 
trade-offs  between  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  across  different  disciplines.  Section 
17.3 provides an assessment of the mitigation options that can help achieve these synergies and avoid 
trade-offs. 17.4 pulls together the theoretical and empirical aspects by detailing the essential elements 
of  an  enabling  environment  that  helps  drive  forward  transitions  that  are  quick,  deep,  broad  and, 
ultimately, sustainable.  
 
17.1.1  Integrating  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  International 

Assessments 

Climate change not only poses a profound challenge to sustainable development, it is inexorably linked 
to it. From the early stages of the IPCC assessment process, this challenge and the inherent link between 
climate  change  and  sustainable  development  have  been  well  recognized.  For  example,  the  First 
Assessment Report (FAR) highlighted the relevance of sustainable development for climate policy. The 
Second Assessment Report (SAR) went further to include equity issues in its presentation of sustainable 
development. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Banuri et al. 2001) made the link even stronger, 
noting that "parties have a right to and should promote sustainable development" (as stated in the text 
of  the  UNFCCC  2015  (Article  3.4)),  and  offering  an  early  review  of  studies  integrating  sustainable 
development and climate change. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (Sathaye et al. 2007) added an 
additional perspective to these interconnections, acknowledging the existence of a two-way relationship 
between sustainable development and climate change. 

 
The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Denton et al. 2014; Fleurbaey et al. 2014) and the Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5C (IPCC 2018; Roy et al. 2018a) have arguably made the strongest links 
between climate and sustainable development to date. One of the key messages of AR5 was that the 
implementation  of  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  actions  could  help  promote  sustainable 
development,  and  it  emphasized  the  need  for  transformational  changes  in  this  regard.  AR5  also 
concluded  that  the  link  between  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  is  cross-cutting  and 
complex, and that thus the impacts of climate change are threatening the efforts being made to achieve 
sustainable development. The IPCC special report on Global Warming of 1.5C  helped systematize 
these  links  by  mapping  the  synergies  and  trade-offs  between  selected  SDG  indicators  and  climate 
mitigation (IPCC 2018; Roy et al. 2018b) (see also sect. 17.3).

Despite the clear links between sustainable development and climate change being recognised from the 
early stages of the IPCC, climate change has often been portrayed as an environmental problem to be 
addressed chiefly by environmental ministries (Brown et al. 2007; Munasinghe 2007; Swart and Raes 
2007).  However,  this  perception  has  evolved  over  time.  It  is  now  increasingly  common  to  see 
governments and other actors understand the wider ramifications of a changing climate for sustainable 
development. In a growing number of studies, work on climate policies and just transitions towards 
sustainable  development  are  framed  as  going  hand  in  hand  (Fuso  Nerini  et  al.  2019;  Dugarova  and 
Gülasan 2017; Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Schramade 2017; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019).  
 

17.1.2  Integrating  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  International 

Policymaking Processes  

Among  the  reasons  for  the  growing  realization  of  these  interdependencies  are  milestones  in 
international climate and sustainable development processes. As outlined in Chapter 14, the year 2015 
was  a  turning  point  due  to  two  agreements:  1)  the  Paris  Agreement;  and  2)  the  2030  Agenda  on 
Sustainable Development and its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Farzaneh et al. 
2021).  
 
Following  a  long  history  of  references  to  sustainable  development  in  the  UNFCCC  and  related 
agreements,  the  Paris  Agreement  helped  to  strengthen  the  links  between  climate  and  sustainable 
development  by  emphasizing  that  sustainability is related  to  its objectives  (Sindico 2016;  UNFCCC 
2016). One of the ways that it helped tighten this link is by institutionalizing bottom-up pledges and the 
review  architecture.  Toward  this  end,  the  Paris  Agreement  instituted  nationally  determined 
contributions  (NDCs)  as  vehicles  through  which  countries  make  pledges  and  demonstrate  their 
commitment to climate action. Although there was no clear guidance on what should be included in the 
NDCs, some of the requirements were elaborated in the Paris Rule Book (see above, Chapter 14). Some 
of the submitted NDCs included only mitigation efforts, but others set out mitigation and adaptation 
goals aligning NDC commitments to national planning processes, while yet others mentioned links with 
the SDGs. 
 
Another  way  that  the  Paris  Agreement  and  the  NDCs  could  strengthen  their  links  to  sustainable 
development is to update country-specific climate pledges. Countries are free to choose their targets 
and the means and instruments with which to implement them. A core feature of the NDCs was that 
countries submit NDCs every five years, giving them an opportunity to assess themselves relative to 
other  countries,  raise  their  ambitions  and  learn  from  their  peers.  Moreover,  it  was  emphasized  that 
countries should not “backslide” in subsequent NDCs, thus ensuring that countries should always be 
forward-looking in respect of increasing their ambitions to deliver the Paris Goals. Höhne et al. (2017) 
found  that,  in  developing  countries  especially,  the  NDC  preparation  process  has  improved  national 
climate policy-making.  
 
Despite some favourable reviews, several assessments of specific countries’ NDCs (Andries et al. 2017; 
Rogelj  et  al.  2016;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016)  have  assessed  that  those  submitted  for  2020-2030  are 
insufficient for delivering on the Paris goals. Updated and/or new NDCs were therefore submitted by 
end  of  2020.  However,  an  assessment  of  those  NDCs  revealed  that  the  level  of  ambition  was 
significantly lower than the goals of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCO 2020; see also this Chapter). One 
of the urgent calls in Paris was to assess the impacts and efforts that need to be undertaken to keep 
global  warming  well  below  2°C  in  relation  to  pre-industrial  levels  and  evaluate  related  global 
greenhouse-gas  emission  pathways  (UNFCCC  2015).  Although  the  initial  NDCs  fell  short  of  these 
goals,  the  idea  was  that  NDCs  would  be  living  documents  that  could  ratchet  up  climate  action  and 
ambition. 
 
Countries  have  also  started  to  take  actions  on  the  SDGs  themselves  (Antwi-Agyei  et  al.  2018a; 
UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018). The SDGs were perceived as a novel approach to development and as 
establishing  a  universal  agenda  for  the  transformation  of  development  patterns  and  socioeconomic 
systems.  At  their  core,  the  SDGs  hold  that  building an  integrated  framework  for  action  necessitates

addressing  the  economic,  social  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable  development  in  an 
integrated manner (Biermann et al. 2017; Kanie and Biermann 2017). The SDGs take multiple elements 
of development into account in aiming to offer coherent, well-integrated, overarching approaches to a 
range of sustainability challenges, including climate change. 
 
One way a link is made between climate and the SDGs is through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). 
Paralleling the bottom-up orientation of the Paris Agreement and the NDCs, every year approximately 
forty  countries  voluntarily  share  their  VNRs  with  the  international  community  at  the  High-Level 
Political Forum (HLPF). Even more flexible than the NDCs, the VNRs can include content such as a 
summary of key policies and measures that are intended to achieve the SDGs, a list of the means of 
implementation that support the SDGs, and related challenges and needs. The VNRs also often cover 
SDG 13 (on climate change) as well as many other issues connected with climate change. Even with 
these links, implementation of the SDGs should be mentioned as part of national development processes 
reflecting  different  countries’  different  priorities,  visions  and  plans  (Hanson  and  Puplampu  2018; 
Marcotullio et al. 2018; OECD 2016; Puplampu et al. 2017; Srikanth 2018). 
 
Yet  another  way  that  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  underlines  the  importance  of 
capturing synergies is its calls for policy coherence (goals 17 and 14). Policy coherence and integration 
between  sectors  are  two  of  the  most  critical  factors  in  breaking  down  the  silo  mode  of  working  of 
different sectors. Working across climate and other sustainability agendas is essential to coherence.  
 
A final way that the sustainability and climate agendas have been linked is through vertical integration. 
Following a similar trend that appeared with Agenda 21, for which many cities adopted local plans, a 
growing number of cities have introduced Voluntary Local Reviews. The VLRs resemble the VNRs, 
but  place  the  emphasis  on  local  actions  and  needs  regarding  the  SDGs  (and  some  links  to  climate 
change)  (Ortíz-Moya  et  al.  2021).  The  2019  SDG  Report  shows  that  150  countries  have  developed 
national  urban  plans,  almost  half  of  them  also  being  in  the  implementation  phase  (United  Nations 
General Assembly 2019). 
 

17.1.3 Integrating Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Other Policymaking 

Processes  

Other non-UN-led  initiatives  involving  international organizations  or  clusters of  countries have  also 
helped to raise  the issue  of  sustainable  development  as  a  framework for  mitigation.  The  OECD,  for 
instance,  assesses  different  types  of  investments  and  economic  activities  with  reference  to  their 
significance for environmental sustainability (OECD 2020), while G20 countries have drawn up action 
agendas  with  sustainable  development  at  the  (UToronto  2016).  Meanwhile,  the  Petersberg  Climate 
Dialogue, a political movement convened by major country-group representatives launched in 2010 by 
the  German  government,  has  also  called  for  sustainability  to  be  an  intrinsic  part  of  the  transition 
(UNFCCO 2020; BMU 2018).  

Due  in  part to the shifting orientation  of  these international  processes, there  is  growing evidence  of 
action  on  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  at  other  levels  of  decision-making.  National 
policies  often  aim  to  implement  climate  change  policies  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development 
(Chimhowu  et  al.  2019;  Chirambo  2018;  ECLAC  2017;  Fuseini  and  Kemp  2015;  Galli  et  al.  2018; 
Haywood  et  al.  2019;  Ministry  of  Environment  of  Jordan  2016;  McKenzie  and  Abdulkadri  2018; 
UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018; UN Women 2017). Some countries are adjusting their existing policies to 
build on themes familiar to sustainable development (Lucas et al. 2016), including renewable energy 
and energy efficiency (Fastenrath and Braun 2018; Kousksou et al. 2015), urban planning (Gorissen et 
al. 2018; Loorbach et al. 2016; Mendizabal et al. 2018), health systems (Pencheon 2018; Roschnik et 
al. 2017) and agricultural systems (Lipper and Zilberman 2018; Shaw and Roberts 2017). Cross-cutting 
and  integrated  approaches,  such  as  the  circular  economy,  have  also  been  gaining  traction  in  some 
European countries (EESC 2015) and G20 countries (Noura et al. 2020). Many of these efforts have 
also extended up to the regional and down to the local level (Gorissen et al. 2018; Hess 2014; Shaw and 
Roberts 2017).

There has also been a shift to actors outside government aligning climate with sustainable development. 
An  assessment  by  Hoyer  (2020)  found  that  collective  action  against  climate  change  by  businesses, 
governments  and  civil  society,  reinforced  through  partnerships  and  coalitions  across  departments, 
industries  and  supply  chains,  can  deliver  significant  development  impacts.  In  order  for  this  diverse 
collection of stakeholders to take action, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed from a linear model of 
knowledge-generation to an interdisciplinary model that co-produces knowledge (Liu et al. 2019). In 
fact,  some  have  argued  that  accelerating  just  transitions  for  purposes  of  sustainable  development 
requires the involvement of several actors, institutions and disciplines (Delina and Sovacool 2018). Not 
only do these roles need to be discussed more thoroughly (Kern and Rogge 2016; den Elzen et al. 2019), 
but it is also important to survey different views on transitions and transformations. A variety of theories 
that are useful for explaining the causes and constraints regarding transitions are examined in Section 
17.2. 
 
 

17.2 Accelerating Transitions in the Context of Sustainable Development: 

Definitions and Theories 

This section focuses on how different theoretical frameworks can help us understand and explain what 
is meant by accelerating transitions  in the context of sustainable development. As suggested in  sect. 
17.1, the reference to “in the context of sustainable development” suggests that sustainable transitions 
require more than speed, also necessitating removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high 
emissions (quality and depth of transitions) while also aligning the interests of different individuals, 
communities, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth of transitions). 
 
The  outcome  of  sustainable  transitions  is  a  sustainable  transformation.  While  transitions  involve 
processes that shift development pathways and reorient energy, transport, urban and other subsystems 
(Loorbach et al. 2017; Chapter 16), transformation is the resulting fundamental reorganization of large-
scale socioeconomic systems (Hölscher et al. 2018). Such a fundamental reorganization often requires 
dynamic  multi-stage transition  processes  that  change everything from  public  policies and  prevailing 
technologies to individual lifestyles, and social norms to governance arrangements and institutions of 
political economy. This set of factors can lock in development pathways and prevent transitions from 
gathering the momentum needed for transformations. Chapter 16 (above) provides an overview of the 
multistage  transition  dynamics  involved  in  moving  from  experimentation  to  commercialization  to 
integration  to  stabilization.  That  overview  describes  how  transitions  can  break through  lock-ins  and 
result in a transformation. 
 
While there may be a relatively consistent set of transition dynamics for all countries, pathways are 
likely to vary across and even within countries. This variation is due to different development levels, 
starting points, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and 
other contextual factors. Given the diversity of contributing factors, a sustainable transition is likely to 
be a complex and multi-faceted process which cannot be reduced to a single dimension (Köhler et al. 
2019). Even with this multi-dimensionality, transition processes are likely to gain speed and become 
more sustainable as decision-makers adopt targeted policies and other interventions. Many disciplines 
have reflected  on the  roles  of  and  relative influence on  the  policies  and  interventions that  can  drive 
transitions. The following discussion describes this diversity of views with a survey of how prominent 
lines of economic, psychological, institutional and systems thinking explain transitions. Though these 
disciplines differ greatly, they often stress that leveraging synergies and managing trade-offs between 
climate change and sustainable development can help advance a transition. 
 
17.2.1 Economics 

This  section  concentrates  on  economic  explanations  for  transitions.  At  the  core  of  many  of  these 
explanations is the assumption that economic development can deliver multiple economic, social and

environmental  benefits.  Many  modern  economic  systems  may  nonetheless  struggle  to  deliver  these 
benefits due to major disruptions and shocks such as climate change  (Heal 2020). One way to limit 
disruptions to free markets are targeted interventions in free markets such as taxes or regulation. These 
targeted  interventions  motivate  firms  and  other  entities  to  internalize  GHGs  and  other  pollutants, 
potentially paving the way for a sustainable transition (Arrow et al. 2004; Chichilnisky and Heal 1998).  
 
A  related  line  of  thought  common  to  economic  explanations  involves  the  principles  of  “weak 
sustainability”. These principles suggest that the substitution of exhaustible resources is, to some extent, 
feasible  (Arrow  et  al.  2004).  One  way  to  capitalize  on  this  substitution  is  to  target  investments  at 
technological change, green growth, and research and development. Targeted investments in the form 
of subsidies can encourage the substitution of exhaustible by non-exhaustible resources. To illustrate 
with a concrete example, investments in renewable energy can not only mitigate climate change but 
also offset the use of exhaustible fossil fuels and boost energy security (Heal 2020). It is nonetheless 
important to note that the principles of “weak sustainability” contrasts with “strong sustainability” or 
“integrated sustainability” principles. These stronger principles suggest  that constraints on resources 
restrict  such  substitutions  (Rockström  et  al.  2009).  These  constraints  merit  attention  because  some 
scarce non-substitutable forms of natural capital can be exhausted (Bateman and Mace 2020). There is 
hence a need to capitalize on possible synergies such as those with other development priorities and 
trade-offs, for example, the exhaustion of non-substitutable resources. Capturing these synergies and 
managing these trade-offs is consistent with sustainable development, a state where the needs of the 
present  generation  do  not  compromise  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs 
(Bruntland, WCED 1987).  
 
As  suggested  above,  aligning  climate  investments  with  other  sustainable  development  objectives  is 
critical  to  a  transition.  In  order  to  support  better  investments  in  sustainable  development,  financing 
schemes, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure schemes and the Task Force 
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), can play important roles (Executive Summary in 
Chapter  15).  After  COVID-19,  economic  recovery  packages  have  increased  government-led 
investments  (Section  1.3.3  in  Chapter  1),  which  could  potentially  be  aligned  with  sustainable 
development. Technological change and innovation are considered key drivers of economic growth and 
of many aspects of social progress (Section 16.1 in Chapter 16), but if technological innovation policies 
are  coordinated  with  the  shift  to  sustainable  development  pathways,  then  the  economic  benefits  of 
technological  change  could  come  at  the  cost  of  increasing  climate  risks  (Chapter  16,  Gossart  2015) 
Chapter 16, 16:1; Alarcón and Vos 2015). The environmental impacts of social and economic activities, 
including emissions of GHGs, are greatly influenced by the rate and direction of technological changes. 
Innovation and technological transformations present trade-offs that create externalities and rebound 
effects.  This  suggests  that  a  sustainable  future  for  people  and  nature  requires  rapid,  radical  and 
transformative societal change by integrating the technical, governance, financial and societal aspects  
(Chapter 16, 16.1; Pörtner et al. 2021).  
 
One area that is pertinent to transitions and has received considerable attention in economic modelling 
involving  climate  change  is  innovation.  In  particular,  some  studies  have  shown  how  low-cost 
innovations  and  improvements  in  end-use  technologies  have  significant  potential  for  emissions 
reductions as well as sustainable development (Wilson et al. 2019). Currently information technologies 
are improving rapidly, and IoT, AI and Big Data can all contribute to other development needs. This is 
often the  case in end-use  sectors,  as  the  benefits  accrue  directly to  the individuals  who  use the  new 
innovations. The achievement and widespread deployment of fully autonomous cars, for example, will 
bring  about  broader  car-  and  ride-sharing  with  negative  or  low  additional  costs  compared  to  more 
conventional approaches to car ownership, with their typically  very low load factors.  (Grubler et al. 
2018)  estimate  that  the  low  energy  demand  (LED)  scenario  which  assumes  information  technology 
innovations and induced social changes, including a sharing economy, have considerable potential for 
harmonizing the multiple achievements of SDGs with low marginal abatement costs compared with 
other scenarios (IPCC 2018).

It  is  nonetheless  important  to  highlight  a  caveat  to  the  above  logic  on  innovation.  Whether  a 
technological innovation is wholly sustainable or not becomes less clear when considering its effects 
on the wider economy. To illustrate, some models predict that CO2 marginal abatement costs in the 
power sector will be 240 and 565 USD/tCO2 for the 2 degree and below 2 degree goals respectively 
(IEA 2017). 
 
In  theory,  if  marginal  abatement  costs  meet  marginal  climate  damage,  mitigation  measures  are 
economically  optimal  in  the  long  run.  Yet  marginal  damage  from  climate  change  is  notoriously 
uncertain,  and  economic  theories  do  not  always  reflect  climate-related  damage.  On  the  other  hand, 
marginal abatement mitigation costs impose additional costs in the short term. These added costs can 
cause productivity in capital to decline through increases in the prices of energy and products in which 
the energies are embodied. These increased costs can  restrict the ability to invest in and achieve the 
sustainable development priorities. However, precisely the opposite can occur when innovation reduces 
additional  costs or achieves  negative  costs.  If technological innovation leads to the  accumulation  of 
capital and productivity increases due to the substitution of energy, material and labour, these are likely 
to deliver sustainable development and climate mitigation benefits. 
 
17.2.2 Institutions, Governance, and Political Economy  

This  subsection  focuses  on  institutions,  governance  and  the  political  economy.  Institutional  and 
governance arrangements can influence which actors possess authority, as well as how motivated they 
are to cooperate in transition processes that are directed at finding solutions to climate change and other 
sustainability challenges. Often cooperation is enabled when policy frameworks or institutions align 
climate change with the political and economic interests of national governments, cities or businesses, 
and when institutional and governance arguments that support that alignment expand the scale of the 
transitions. However, there may also be political and economic interests and structures that can lock in 
unsustainable  development  patterns,  frustrate  this  alignment  and  slow  down  transitions  (Haas  2021; 
Mattioli et al. 2020; Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Power 2016).  
 
An  extensive  literature  has  examined  how  the  international  climate  agreements  and  architecture 
influence  collaboration  across  countries regarding  climate  and  sustainable  development to  support a 
transition (Bradley 2005). For example, international institutions offer opportunities for governments 
and other actors to share new perspectives on integrated solutions (Cole 2015). For some observers, 
however,  decades  of  difficulties  in  crafting  a  comprehensive  climate-change  agreement  and  the 
resulting  fragmented  climate-policy  landscape  have  been  inimical  to  the  collaboration  needed  for  a 
transition  (Chapter 1 and 13; Nasiritousi and Bäckstrand 2019; van Asselt 2014). Yet others see the 
potential for more incremental cooperation across countries, even without a single, integrated forms of 
climate governance (Keohane and Victor 2016).  
 
A  related  argument  suggests  that  fragmentation  at  the  global  level  provides  opportunities  for 
cooperation at the national level (Kanie and Biermann 2017). For example, in contrast to the relatively 
top-down Kyoto Protocol, the bottom-up pledge and review architecture of the Paris Agreement has 
prompted  national  governments  to  integrate  climate  change  with  other  sustainable  development 
priorities  (Nachmany  and  Setzer  2018;  Townshend  et  al.  2013).  Concrete  examples  included 
incorporating the SDGs into the NDCs as an international response to climate change (The Energy and 
Resources  Institute  2017)  or  bringing  climate  into  sustainable  development  strategies  and  so-called 
voluntary national reviews (VNRs) as part of the SDG and 2030 Agenda process (Elder and King 2018; 
Elder and Bartalini 2019).  
 
Another branch of institutional research is concerned with the interactions between multiple levels of 
governance. In this multi-level governance perspective, cities and other subnational governments often 
lead transitions by devising innovative solutions to challenged to climate and local energy, transport, 
the environment, resilience and other forms of sustainability (Bellinson and Chu 2019; Doll and Puppim 
De Oliveira 2017; Geels 2011; Koehn 2008; Rabe 2007; van der Heijden et al. 2019). A complementary 
perspective suggests that national governments can help scale up transitions by allocating resources and

can provide the technical support that can spread innovative solutions (Bowman et al. 2017; Corfee-
Morlot  et  al.  2009;  Gordon  2015).  Such  support  has  become  increasingly  important  during  the 
pandemic,  as  national  government  transfer  funds  for  investments  in  climate-friendly  infrastructure, 
transport systems and energy systems. This line of thinking is supported by calls to strengthen vertical 
and horizontal integration within and across government agencies and stakeholders in ways that can 
enhance policy coherence (Amanuma et al. 2018; OECD 2018, 2019). The incoherence or misalignment 
between national and local fiscal institutions and policies can restrict the ability of local governments 
to secure resources for climate-friendly investments. Such investments are particularly likely to flow, 
as more local governments have adopted net zero targets, climate emergency declarations and action 
plans  that  can  stimulate  innovations  (Davidson  et  al.  2020).  Others  have  seen  greater  potential  for 
collaboration and innovation, with more multi-centred or polycentric forms of governance that lead to 
the  formulation  and  dissemination  of  transformative  solutions  to  climate  and  other  environmental 
challenges  (Ostrom  2008).  Though  much  of  the  above  governance  research  has  focused  on  western 
countries, there are some applications in other regions and countries such as China (Gu et al. 2020).  
 
Yet another set of channels facilitating integration between climate and other concerns are networks of 
like-minded actors working across administrative borders and physical boundaries. For instance, city 
networks such as the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy  (Covenant of Mayors 2019), 
the World Mayors Council on Climate Change (ICLEI 2019; C40 Cities 2019) and UN- UNDRR (2019) 
have  agreed  to  share  decision-making  tools  and  good  practices,  and  to  sponsor  ambition-raising 
campaigns  that  help  align  climate  and  sustainable  development  concerns  within  and  across  cities 
(Betsill and Bulkeley 2006) (see Chapter 8 and Section 17.3.3.5). This can be particularly important for 
less capable “following” and “laggard” cities needing greater financing and other forms of support to 
move a transition forward (Fuhr et al. 2018).  
 
Furthermore,  sub-national  governments  may  often  work  together  with  civil-society  groups  to  create 
new  networked  forms  of  governance  (Biermann  et  al.  2012).  Other  forms  of  multi-stakeholder 
partnerships focusing on issues with strong climate synergies, such as forms of air pollution known as 
short-lived climate pollutants (Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)) or transport (Sustainable Low 
Carbon Transport Partnership (SLoCaT)), take their cue from global scientific communities or civic-
minded advocacy groups that transmit knowledge across boundaries (Keck and Sikkink 1999).  There 
is also scope for suggesting that the international climate regime serves a Global Framework for Climate 
Action (GFCA) in helping orchestrate the multilateral climate regime and non-state and subnational 
initiatives  (Chan  and  Pauw  2014),  though  questions  remain  about  its  actual  impacts  on  mitigation 
(Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017).  
 
Policymaking institutions and networks are themselves policies. A significant literature has looked at 
integrated policy frameworks and efforts across sectors, including climate adaptation and mitigation, as 
drivers  of transitions  (Landauer  et al.  2015;  Favretto  et  al.  2018;  Obersteiner  et  al.  2016;  Steen  and 
Weaver 2017; Thornton and Comberti 2017). Policy coherence between climate and other development 
objectives  is  often  considered  essential  to  sustainable  development  (Sovacool  2018).  A  similar 
discussion  about  synergies  and  conflicts  has  been  raised  on  the  relationship  between  resilience  and 
sustainability  (Marchese  et  al.  2018).  To  help  achieve  coherence,  there  have  been  some  efforts  to 
develop suitable tools and decision-making frameworks (Scobie 2016).  
 
A related line of reasoning has suggested that sustainable development often requires not one but a mix 
of  policy  instruments  to  bring  about  the  multiple  policy  effects  needed  for  social  and  technological 
change (Edmondson et al. 2019; Rogge and Johnstone 2017). Following these calls, some governments 
have aimed to address climate change and sustainability jointly with coherent and integrated approaches 
to achieving these agendas (Chimhowu et al. 2019), although for some countries (SIDS) this has proven 
more challenging  (Scobie 2016). 
 

Though the above work tends to downplay politics and business, others suggest that political economy 
should feature prominently in transitions. Some branches of political-economy research underline how

resource-intensive  and  fossil-fuel  industries  leverage  their  resources  and  positions  to  undermine 
transitions (Chapter 1; Geels 2014; Jones, C.A. and Levy 2009; Moe 2014; Newell and Paterson 2010; 
Zhao et al. 2013). These vested interests can lock in status quo policies in countries where political 
systems offer interest groups more opportunities to veto or overturn climate- or eco-friendly proposals 
(Madden 2014). Companies with a strong interest in earning profits and building competitiveness from 
conventional fossil fuel-based energy systems have particularly strong incentives to capture politicians 
and agencies (Meckling and Nahm 2018). Such strategies can be particularly powerful when combined 
with concerns over job losses and dislocation, preventing transitions from gaining traction (Haas 2021; 
Mattioli et al. 2020; Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Power 2016).  
 
This suggests that politics can be an impediment to change: other studies argue instead that politics can 
be harnessed to drive transitions forward. For example, some observers contend that building coalitions 
around green industrial policies and sequencing reforms to reward industries in such coalitions can align 
otherwise divergent interests and inject momentum into transitions (Meckling et al. 2015). Others see 
the  effects  of  political  economy  varying  over  time  depending  upon  external  market  conditions.  To 
illustrate, renewable feed-in tariffs in Europe persisted for over two decades and were crucial in wind 
and solar power technologies making the breakthrough. But once competition from China led to the 
demise of European technology providers, and once European populations started to oppose surcharges 
on  their  electricity  bills,  feed-in  tariffs  were  abolished  by  politicians  in  the  purely  national  interest 
(Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017).  
 
17.2.3   Psychology, Individual Beliefs and Social Change 

This subsection draws on value- and action-oriented research that employs inter- or transdisciplinary 
methods  such  as  transactional  psychology,  transformative  science  and  similarly  focused  disciplines 
(Wamsler et al. 2021). These approaches frequently encourage researchers to participate in transitions 
that  induce  changes  in  the  researcher’s  own  beliefs  while  triggering  wider  shifts  in  social  norms 
(including human stewardship for the natural environment) (Adger et al. 2013; Hulme 2009; Ives et al. 
2019; O’Brien 2018). This research also emphasizes how changes in individual beliefs could lead to 
climate actions that contribute to more sustainable, equitable and just societies (see e.g. “the mind- & 
paradigm shifts”  (Göpel et al. 2016; Meadows 2008). They further suggest the potential for virtuous 
cycles  of individual-level and  wider social  changes that  ultimately  benefit  the  climate  (Banks  2007; 
Day et al. 2014; Lockhart 2011; Montuori and Donnelly 2018; Power 2016).  

 
The starting point for this virtuous circle are inner transitions. Inner transitions occur within individuals, 
organizations  and  even  larger  jurisdictions  that  alter  beliefs  and  actions  involving  climate  change 
(Woiwode  et  al.  2021).  An  inner  transition  within  an  individual  (see  e.g.,  Parodi  and  Tamm  2018) 
typically involves a person gaining a deepening sense of peace and a willingness to help others, as well 
as protecting the climate and the planet (see e.g., Banks 2007; Power 2016). Inner transition can imply 
that individuals become  sympathetic to concerns that include climate issues and values connected to 
nature. For instance, they may include a desire to become a steward of nature (Buijs et al. 2018), “live 
according to the principles of integrated sustainability” (Schweizer-Ries 2018), “achieve the good life” 
(see Section 1.6.2 in Chapter 1; Asara et al. 2015; Escobar 2015; Kallis 2017; Latouche 2018; Chapter 
5) or protect the well-being of other living creatures (Section 1.6.3.1 in Chapter 1 and Chapter 5).  
 
Examples have also been seen in relation to a similar set of inner transitions to individuals, organizations 
and  societies,  which  involves  embracing  post-development,  de-growth,  or  non-material  values  that 
challenge carbon-intensive lifestyles and development models (Kothari 2019; Neuteleers and Engelen 
2015; Paech 2017; Sklair 2016). These shifts in values can occur when humans reconnect with nature, 
deepen their consciousness and take responsibility for protecting the planet and its climate (Cross et al. 
2019; Martinez-Juarez et al. 2015; Speldewinde et al. 2015). Changes in both values and beliefs may 
also  emerge  through  consciousness-raising  processes  where  people  cooperate  in  ways  that  would 
protect the climate (see  Section 1.6.4 in Chapter 1; Banks 2007; Hedlund-de Witt et al. 2014; Woiwode 
and Woiwode 2019).

Many  of  the  above-mentioned  beliefs  and  values  that  support  climate  actions  have  spread  through 
expanding interests in conservationist world views, indigenous cultures (see e.g., Lockhart 2011) and 
branches of neuroscience and psychology that suggest different notions of the self (Hüther 2018; Lewis 
2016;  Seligman  and  Csikszentmihalyi  2014).  These  beliefs  and  values  can  also  be  spread  through 
meditation,  yoga  or  other  social  practices  that  encourage  lower  carbon  lifestyles  (Woiwode  and 
Woiwode  2019).  Another  channel  for  spreading  climate  concerns  is  sustainability  culture,  which  is 
premised on connecting people and communities, and has also benefited from the internet and digital 
technologies that support these connections (see e.g., Bradbury 2015; Scharmer 2018). The spread of 
this culture, in turn,  has led  to the  creation of social fields  that allow  changes to  happen (  (see  e.g., 
Gillard  et  al.  2016)  or  has  promoted  low-carbon  thinking  and related  behavioural  changes  (O’Brien 
2018;  Veciana  and  Ottmar  2018).  Studies  of  social  contagions  may  also  offer  insights  into  the 
mechanisms that lead to the adoption of new values and related climate actions (see e.g., Iacopini et al. 
2019).  It  is  nonetheless  worth  highlighting  that  communication  networks  and  other  mechanisms 
promoting the spread of interpersonal communication that can spread pro-climate views may also lead 
to the proliferation of climate scepticism and denial (Leombruni 2015). At the same time, some studies 
suggest that such scepticism can be countered by the generation of more credible information on climate 
change (Samantray and Pin 2019).  
 
One  of  the more  direct  channels  through  which  transitions  spread are  climate  change education and 
action-oriented  research  (Fazey  et  al.  2018;  Ives  et  al.  2019;  Scharmer  2018;  Schäpke  et  al.  2018; 
Schneidewind et al. 2016). For instance, research using “social experiments” or “real world labs” has 
helped give rise to shifts in mindsets on energy, food, transport and other systems that can benefit the 
climate (Bernstein and Hoffmann 2018; Berkhout et al. 2010; Bulkeley et al. 2015; Hoffmann 2010). 
In  much  the  same  way,  the  acquisition  of  transformational  knowledge  and  transformative  learning 
(Lange 2018; O’Neil and Boyce 2018; Pomeroy and Oliver 2018; Walsh et al. 2020; Williams 2013) 
contributes to thinking and acting that open climate-friendly development pathways (Berkhout et al. 
2010; Lo and Castán Broto 2019; Roberts et al. 2018; Turnheim and Nykvist 2019; Section 1.7.2 in 
Chapter 1). First-person and action research can also facilitate similar changes that bring about climate 
actions (see e.g. Bradbury et al. 2019; Dick 2007; Hutchison and Walton 2015; Streck 2007). 
 
17.2.4 System Level Explanations 

Systems explanations help explain the dynamics of transitions toward sustainable development while 
explicitly uncovering links between the human and natural worlds, the socio-cultural embeddedness of 
technology,  and  the  inertia  behind  high-carbon  development  pathways.  This  line  of  thinking  often 
envisages  transitions  emerging  from  complex  systems  in  which  many  different  elements  interact  at 
small scales and spontaneously self-organize to produce behaviour that is unexpected, unmanaged and 
fundamentally different from the sum of the system’s constituent parts.  

the 

including 

‘planetary  boundaries’  approach 

 
Social-ecological systems theory describes the processes of exchange and interaction between human 
and ecological systems, investigating in particular non-linear feedback occurring across different scales 
(Folke  2006;  Holling  2001).  This  approach  has  informed  subsequent  theoretical  and  empirical 
developments, 
(Rockström  et  al.  2009), 
conceptualizations of vulnerability and adaptive capacity (Hinkel 2011; Pelling 2010) and more recent 
explorations of urban resilience (Romero-Lankao et al. 2016) and regenerative sustainability (Clayton 
and Radcliffe 2018; Robinson and Cole 2015). Employing a systems lens to address the ‘root causes’ 
of unsustainable development pathways (such as dysfunctional social or economic arrangements) rather 
than the ‘symptoms’ (dwelling quality, vehicle efficiency, etc.) can trigger the non-linear change needed 
for a transformation to take place  (Pelling et al. 2015). Exploring synergies between climate-change 
adaptation,  mitigation  and  other  sustainability  priorities  (such  as  biodiversity  and  social  equity,  for 
instance)  (Beg  2002;  Burch  et  al.  2014;  Shaw  et  al.  2014)  may  help  to  yield  these  transformative 
outcomes, though data regarding the specific nature of these synergies is still emerging.  
 
Socio-technical transition theory, on the other hand, explores the ways in which technologies such as 
low-carbon  vehicles  or  regenerative  buildings  are  bound  up  in  a  web  of  social  practices,  physical

infrastructure,  market  rules,  regulations,  norms  and  habits  (see,  for  example,  Loorbach  et  al.  2017). 
Radical  social  and  technical  innovations  can  emerge  that  ultimately  challenge  destabilized  or 
increasingly  ineffective  and  undesirable  incumbents,  but  path  dependencies  often  stymie  these 
transition processes, suggesting an important role for governance actors (Burch 2017; Frantzeskaki et 
al. 2012; Holscher et al. 2019).  
 
Socio-technical transitions theory, on the other hand, explores the ways in which technologies such as 
low-carbon  vehicles  or  regenerative  buildings  are  bound  up  in  a  web  of  social  practices,  physical 
infrastructure,  market  rules,  regulations,  norms  and  habits  (see,  for  example,  Loorbach  et  al.  2017). 
Radical  social  and  technical  innovations  can  emerge  that  ultimately  challenge  destabilized  or 
increasingly  ineffective  and  undesirable  incumbents,  but  path  dependencies  often  stymie  these 
transition processes, suggesting an important role for governance actors (Burch 2017; Frantzeskaki et 
al. 2012; Holscher et al. 2019).  
  
This also reveals the large-scale macro-economic, political and cultural trends (or contexts) that may 
reinforce or call into question the usefulness of current systems of production and consumption. One 
branch of this theory, transition management (Kern and Smith 2008; Loorbach 2010), explores ways of 
guiding  a  socio-technical  system  from  one  path  to  another.  In  particular,  it  highlights  interactions 
between actors, technologies and institutions, and the complex governance mechanisms that facilitate 
them (Smith et al. 2005). The challenge, in part, becomes linking radical short-term innovations with 
longer-term  visions  of  sustainability  (Loorbach  and  Rotmans  2010)  and  creating  opportunities  for 
collaborative course-correction in light of new information or unexpected outcomes (Burch 2017).  
 
17.2.5 Conclusions 

This section has surveyed several explanations for interventions that can give rise to transitions. The 
review  suggests  that  there  are  several  differences  between  these  various  perspectives.  Whether 
individuals, organisations, markets or sociotechnical systems drive or undermine transitions is a key 
distinction. These differences have implications for the evidence these claims draw on in support of 
their arguments. For instance, some of the explanations tend to employ qualitative evidence to explain 
changes in attitudes at the individual or community levels as paving the way for broader changes to 
cultures and belief systems. Others assess how institutional arrangements can be reformed in order to 
align climate with the sustainable development agenda to enable a transition.  
 
While there are indeed significant differences between explanations, there are also important parallels. 
Such  parallels  begin  with  a  shared  emphasis  on  synergies  and  trade-offs  between  climate  and 
sustainable development. Most explanations tend to underline the importance of synergies in aligning 
the  climate  with  broader  sustainability  agendas.  Most  importantly,  many  of  the  explanations  are 
complementary with the systems-level discussion in that they offer a broad framework, while economic, 
psychological and governance theories offer more specific insights. Moving a transition forward will 
often require drawing upon insights from multiple schools of thought. Though is unlikely that a one-
size-fits-all set of factors will drive a transition, there is a growing body of empirical evidence shedding 
light  on  the  factors  that  can  strengthen  synergies  between  climate  and  the  broader  sustainable 
development agenda.

objectives across methodologies, scenarios and sectors. Conclusions are drawn based on national and 
sub-national, sectoral and cross-sectoral, short- and long-term transition studies presented in this and 
other sections of the report as a basis for establishing an overall picture of how sustainable development 
and climate change policies can be linked as a basis for accelerated transitions 

 
This section focuses initially on issues related to short- and long-term transitions to meet climate change 
and  sustainable  development  goals  in  the  context  of  the  UNFCCC  and  the  UN  2030  Agenda  for 
Sustainable  Development.  Global-modelling  results  and  economy-wide  studies  are  then  assessed, 
followed by a discussion of specific challenges in relation to renewable energy penetration and phasing 
out fossil fuels, stranded assets and just transitions. Key synergies and trade-offs between meeting the 
UN 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and mitigation are then illustrated by means of cross-
sectoral examples. Finally, an overview of the assessment of SDG synergies and trade-offs based on all 
sectoral chapters in this report for a range of key mitigation options is then presented. 
 
17.3.2 Short-term and long-term transitions  

It is increasingly being recognised that sustainable-development policy goals and meeting short- and 
long-terms climate policy goals are closely linked (IPCC 2018). It is also being realised that, under the 
Paris Agreement, climate change policies should be integrated into sustainable development agendas, 
while  the  UN  2030  Agenda  as  well  includes  SDG  13  on  climate  actions.  In  this  way,  both  UN 
agreements provide joint opportunities for systematic transitions in support of both climate change and 
sustainable development. Achievement of the Paris Agreement’s goals will require a rapid and deep 
worldwide  transition  in  all  GHG  emissions  sectors,  including  land-use,  energy,  industry,  buildings, 
transport and cities, as well as in consumption and behaviour (United Nations Environment Programme 
2019). Meeting the goals of such a transformation requires that the long-term targets and pathways to 
fulfil the stabilization scenarios play an important role in guiding the direction and pathways of short-
term transitions. There is therefore a need for long- and short-term policies and investment decisions to 
be closely coordinated. 
 
In  the  context  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  countries  have  submitted  their  initial  plans  for  the 
decarbonization of their economies to the UNFCCC in the form of their so-called national determined 
contributions  (NDCs).  The  ambitions  of  the  NDCs  are  closely  related  to  the  ongoing  UNFCCC 
negotiations over the financial measures and forms of compensation. Although the Paris Agreement 
emphasizes the links between climate policies and sustainable development, the UN’s 2030 Agenda 
and the SDGs are not very well represented at present in the NDCs, according to  Fuso Nerini et al. 
(2019).  Very  few  of the  NDCs  include  any  reference  to  the  SDGs,  which  Fuso Nerini  et  al.  (2019) 
highlight as a barrier to the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement, which induces them to 
call for a more holistic policy approach. Campagnolo and Davide (2019) have assessed the impacts of 
the submitted NDCs on poverty eradication and inequalities of income based on empirical research and 
a global CGE model. One conclusion is that the NDCs of less developed countries would tend to reduce 
poverty alleviation, but this can be offset if international financial support is provided for the mitigation 
actions.  
 
The alignment of climate-policy targets in the NDCs with sustainable development has been assessed 
by means of integrated assessment models (IAMs), macroeconomic and sectoral modelling. Iyer et al. 
(2018) based on IAM-based studies, the implications of framing NDCs being placed more narrowly on 
mitigation  targets  rather  than  on  a  framing  in  which  the  impacts  on  sustainable  development  were 
explicitly taken into consideration. It was thus concluded that some SDGs would be directly supported 
as a side benefit of the climate policy targets included in the NDCs, while other SDGs needed a special 
policy  design  going  beyond  narrow  climate  policy  objectives.  Iyer  et  al.  (2018)  also  assessed  the 
regional distribution of efforts in terms of domestic mitigation costs and SDG impacts and concluded 
that the geographical distribution of mitigation costs and SDG benefits were not similar, so a special 
effort would be needed to match climate policies and policies to meet the SDGs. Accordingly, a national 
decision-making perspective suggests that SDGs should be integrated into national climate policies.

The NDCs submitted to the Paris Agreement have demonstrated a lack of progress in meeting the long-
term temperature  goals.  In  the  context  of  the  UN’s  2030  Agenda, the  UN  Sustainable  Development 
Report 2019 (Sachs et al. 2019) also concluded that there is a particular lack of progress in achieving 
SDG 13 (Climate action), SDG 14 (Life below water) and SDG 15 (Life on land). Given the close link 
between the SDGs and climate-change policies, the current obstacles in meeting the former could also 
be a barrier to realizing transitions to low-carbon societies. Conversely, opportunities to leverage the 
SDGs  could  in  many  cases  involve  climate  actions,  since  policies  enabling  climate  adaptation  and 
mitigation  could  also  support  food  and  energy  security  and  water  conservation  if  they  were  well 
designed (see the detailed discussion in the section on synergies and trade-offs between climate policies 
and meeting the SDGs in section 17.3.3.7, Chapter 3 and IPCC 2018).These findings point to a specific 
need to align economic and social development perspectives, climate change and natural systems. While 
all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and over time. 
These  priorities  are  strongly  linked  to  local  contexts  and  depend  on  which  dimension  of  the 
improvement in the well-being of people is considered to be the most urgent. Eradicating poverty and 
reducing  inequality  are  key  development  priorities  for  many  low-  and  middle-income  countries. 
(Section 4.3.2.1 in Chapter 4). 
 
A key barrier to the development of national plans and policies to meet the UN 2030 SDG goals is the 
lack of finance. Sachs et al. (2019) conclude that meeting the SDGs to achieve social transformations 
worldwide  would require  2-3%  of  global  GDP  and  that it  would  be  a  huge challenge to ensure that 
finance is targeted to the world’s poorest countries and people. The UN Secretary General has called 
for the allocation of finance to meet the UN’s 2030 Agenda with a strong emphasis on the private sector, 
but to date no governance frameworks or associated financial modalities have been established in the 
UN or the UNFCCC context for the formal alignment of sustainable development and transitions to 
take place in accordance with the low global temperature-stabilization targets in the Paris Agreement. 
Accelerating investments particularly in low-income countries will be required to meet both the Paris 
goals  and  the  SDGs  (Section  15.6.7  in  Chapter  15).  The  mismatch  between  capital  and  investment 
needs, home bias considerations and differences in risk perceptions between rich and poor represent 
major challenges for private finance. Green bond markets and markets for sustainable financal products 
have increased significantly, and the landscape has continued to evolve since AR5 (Executive Summary 
in Chapter 15). Special efforts and activities are particularly required for raising finance in developing 
countries. 
 
Based on the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC has invited countries to communicate their mid-century 
and  long-term  low  greenhouse-gas  emission-development  strategies  by  2020  (UNFCCC  2019). 
National long-term low-emission development strategies and their global stocktake in the UNFCCC 
context provide a platform for informing the long-term strategic thinking on transitions towards low-
carbon societies. One specific value of these plans is that they reflect how specific transition pathways, 
policies and measures can work in different parts of the world in a very context-specific way, that is, 
by taking context-specific issues and stakeholder perspectives into consideration. Many nations have 
submitted  national  long-term  strategies  to  the  UNFCCC,  including  sustainable  development 
perspectives (See Section 4.2.4, ‘Mid-century low-emission strategies at the national level’ in Chapter 
4 for a review of the plans and scientific assessments). 
 
17.3.2.1 Model assessments on the sustainable development pathways for decarbonization  
This  section  assesses  the  model  evaluations  of  the  sustainable  development  pathways  for 
decarbonization, including the co-benefits and trade-offs involving explorations of alternative future 
development pathways as a basis for clarifying societal objectives and understanding the restrictions. 
Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability involves a number of complex issues, which 
are difficult to integrate into models. For a more detailed discussion about this, see Section 4.4.1 in 
Chapter 4 and the Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4.  
 
Development pathways that focus narrowly on climate mitigation or economic growth will not lead to 
the SDGs and long-term climate-stabilization objectives being achieved. The best chances of doing this

lie  in  development  pathways  that  can  maximize  the  synergies  between  climate  mitigation  and 
sustainable development more broadly (Section 1.3.2 in Chapter 1). Areas of focal modelling include 
green  investments,  technological  change,  employment  generation  and  the  performance  of  policy 
instruments, such as green taxes, subsidies, emission permits, investments and finance. Short- and long-
term macroeconomic models have been used to assess the impacts of such policy instruments. Jaumotte 
et al. (2021) analyse the economic impacts on net zero emissions by 2050 with a focus on short-term 
economic policies and the integration of climate policies such as CO2 taxes with green reform policies. 
This  may  imply  the  co-creation  of  benefits  between  climate  policy  objectives,  and  macroeconomic 
policy goals such as employment creation.  
 
There is an emerging modelling literature focusing on the synergies and trade-offs between low-carbon 
development pathways and various aspects of sustainable development. The early literature, including 
that on IAMs, and macroeconomic and sectoral models mainly focused on the co-benefits of mitigation 
policies in terms of reduced air pollution, energy security and to some extent employment generation 
security (IPCC 2014, 2018c; WGIII AR6 Chapter 6). Some models have been developed further with 
assessments  of  a  broader  range  of  the  joint  benefits  of  mitigation,  health,  water,  land-use  and  food 
security (Clarke et al. 2014; IPCC 2014, 2018; Kolstad et al. 2014). According to WGIII AR6 Chapter 
1, there is a need to incorporate issues and enablers further, including a wide range of non-climate risks, 
varying forms of innovation, possibilities for behavioural and social change, feasible policies and equity 
issues (Executive Summary in Chapter 1). 
 
IAMs  and  macroeconomic  models  typically  calculate  mitigation  costs  based  on  the  assumption  that 
markets internalise externalities like GHG emissions through carbon prices  (Barker et al. 2016; IEA 
2017,  2019).  Yet,  there  are  legitimate  questions  to  be  asked  about  whether  carbon-pricing  will  be 
efficient if markets are inefficient (World Bank 2019). However, market inefficiencies are difficult to 
integrate into the models. How GHG emissions taxes would actually work is thus quite uncertain based 
on the modelling studies (Barker et al. 2016; Fontana and Sawyer 2016; Meyer et al. 2018). Despite 
these limitations, the use of GHG emission taxes as an effective instrument based on modelling results 
in practice has implications for public policies and private-sector investments.  
 
Despite the shortcomings of conventional economic thought and models, already pointed out, improved 
models have demonstrated new perspectives on how mitigation costs can be assessed in macroeconomic 
models. For instance, while a conventional perspective might suggest that climate-change mitigation 
costs  can  limit  investments  in  sustainability  because  they  reduce  the  productivity  of  capital  by 
increasing energy prices and the products in which energies are embodied, another perspective is that 
innovation can imply increases in efficiency and that the substitution of energy, material and labour can 
lead to the accumulation of capital and productivity gains. This appears to occur with innovations in 
end-use  energy  applications  generating  emissions  reductions  and  delivering  on  other  sustainable 
development  benefits  (Wilson  et  al.  2019).  Similarly,  IAM  models  have  been  applied  to  model  the 
potential  for  low  energy  demand  scenarios  associated  with  demand-side  innovations  in  the  service 
sector.  Grubler  et al.  (2018)  have developed  a  climate-friendly,  low-energy  demand  (LED)  scenario 
which assumes information  technology  innovations such  as the internet  of  things  (IoT)  and  induced 
social changes such as the sharing economy. Nonetheless there are still very important limits on the 
degree to which highly aggregated IAM models and macroeconomic models can integrate ethics, equity 
and several other key policy-relevant aspects of sustainable development (Easterlin et al. 2010; Koch 
2020).  A  key  limitation  in  this  context  is  that,  while  all  countries  share  the  totality  of  the  SDGs, 
development  priorities  differ  across  countries  and  over  time.  Moreover,  these  priorities  are  strongly 
linked  to  local  contexts,  and  this  can  only  be  reflected  directly  in  national  models  (Section  4.3.2  in 
Chapter 4). 
 
An example of a project that assesses the economy-wide impacts of linking sustainable development 
with deep decarbonization is the deep decarbonization project or DDPP (Bataille et al. 2016), which is 
undertaking a comparative assessment of studies of sixteen countries representing more than 74% of 
global  energy-related  emissions  for  the  pathway  to  two-degree  stabilization  scenarios.  The  DDDP’s 
methodology  is  to  combine  scenario  analysis  in  different  national  contexts  using  macroeconomic

models and sectoral models and to facilitate a consistent cross-country analysis using a set of common 
assumptions.  
 
The  key  conclusions  of  the  DDPP  team  on  the  economy-wide  impacts  are  that  country  studies  like 
South  Africa’s  demonstrate  that  it  is  possible  to  improve  income  distribution,  alleviate  poverty  and 
reduce unemployment while simultaneously transitioning to a low-carbon economy (Altieri et al. 2016). 
The DDPP in Japan explores whether energy security can be enhanced through increases in renewable 
energy (Oshiro et al. 2016). The reduction of uncontrolled fossil-fuel emissions has significant public-
health  benefits  according  to  the Chinese  and  Indian  DDPPs,  as  fossil-fuel  combustion  is  the  major 
source of air pollution.  
 
For example, in the Chinese DDDP, deep decarbonization scenarios have resulted in reductions of 42–
79% in primary air pollutants (e.g., SO2, NOx, particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs),  and  NH3),  thus  meeting  air-quality  standards  in  major  cities.  The  deep  decarbonization 
scenarios include the large and fast energy-efficient improvements required to improve energy access 
and  affordability.  The  DDPP  studies  are  thus  an  example  of  an  approach  in  which  national  deep-
carbonization scenarios are linked to the development goals of income generation, energy access and 
affordability, employment, health and environmental policy. 
 
Sustainable  development  scenarios  have  also  been  developed  by  the  Low-Carbon  Society’s  (LCS) 
assessments  (Kainuma  et  al.  2012),  in  which  multiple  sustainable  development  and  climate  change 
mitigation goals were assessed jointly. The scenario analysis was conducted for Asian countries such 
as South Korea, Japan, India, China and Nepal with a soft linked IAM using economy-wide and sectoral 
models and linked to very active stakeholder engagement in order to reflect national policy perspectives 
and priorities. Some of the models are economy-wide global IAMs, while others are national partial 
equilibrium models. 
 
The LCS scenarios also include a specific attempt to include ongoing dialogues with policy-makers and 
stakeholders in order to reflect governance and enabling factors and to enable the modelling processes 
to  reflect  political  realism  as  far  as  possible.  Diverse  stakeholders  who  acted  as  validators  of  the 
scientific process were included, stakeholder preferences were revealed, and recipients and users of the 
LCS outputs were included in ongoing dialogues on outputs and in interpreting the results. The aim of 
the  stakeholder  interactions  was  thus  to  fill  the  gap  between  typical  laboratory-style  integrated 
modelling  assessments  and  down-scaled  but  unaligned  practical  assessments  performed  at 
disaggregated geographical and sector-specific scales. 
 
Energy scenarios for sustainable development were included in The World Energy Outlook of the IEA 
(IEA 2019, 2020) in terms of a Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which assessed not only SDG 
13 (climate change) but also SDG 7 (energy access) and SDG 3.9 (air pollution). This scenario takes as 
its  starting  point  the  policy  goal  of  meeting  these  SDGs  and  then  assesses  the  costs  of  meeting  an 
emissions reduction target of 70% of CO2 from the energy system by 2030. The scenario concludes that 
retrofitting coal-fired power plants with pollution controls is the cheapest option for dealing with local 
pollution in the short term, but that this is not consistent with meeting the long-term emissions goals of 
the Paris Agreement. The SDS scenario combines the goal of reducing the amount of CO2 in the energy 
system by 70%, with large decreases in energy-related emissions of NOX, SO2 and PM2.5, leading to a 
fall of 40–60% by 2030, and to 2.5 million fewer premature deaths from air pollution in 2030 than in 
the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which represent a continuation of current trends in the energy 
system (IEA 2020).  
 
The  costs  of  energy-system  transitions  have  been  assessed  by  several  energy-system  studies.  The 
economic costs of meeting the different goals depend on the stringency of the mitigation target, as well 
as economic (fuel prices etc.) and technological developments (technology availability, capital costs 
etc.). In addition, changes in infrastructure and behavioural patterns and lifestyles matter. Model-based 
assessments vary, depending on these assumptions and differences in modelling approaches (Krey et 
al.  2019;  Section  6.7.7  in  Chapter  6).  Country  characteristics  determine  the  social,  economic  and

technical priorities for low-emission pathways. Domestic policy circumstances impact on pathways and 
costs, e.g. when affordability and energy-security concerns are emphasized (Oshiro et al. 2016).  
 
Mitigation policies can have important distributive effects between and within countries, and may affect 
impact  on  the  poorest  through  their  effects  on  energy  and  food  prices  (Section  3.6.4  in  Chapter  3; 
Hasegawa et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2019), while higher levels of warming are projected to generate 
higher inequality between countries as well as within them (Chapter 16). Mitigation thus can reduce 
economic inequalities and poverty by avoiding such impacts (Section 3.6.4 in Chapter 3). 
 
Improved air quality and the associated health effects are the co-benefit category dominating model-
based assessments of co-benefits, but a few studies have also covered other aspects, such as the health 
effects of dietary change and biodiversity impacts (Section 3.6.3 in Chapter 3 and Section 17.3 of this 
chapter). Mitigation has implications for global economic inequalities through different channels and 
can  compound  or  lessen  inequalities,  avoid  impacts  and  create  co-benefits  that  reduce  inequalities 
(Section 3.6.4 in Chapter 3). There are, however, several challenges involved in balancing the dilemmas 
associated with meeting the SDGs, such as, for example, energy access, equity and sustainability. Fossil 
fuel-dependent developing countries cannot transit to low-carbon economics without considering the 
wider impacts on development by doing so (Section 3.7.3 in Chapter 3).  
 
Climate  change  has  negative  impacts  on  agricultural  productivity  in  general,  including  unequal 
geographical distribution (Chapter 3). On top of that, there is also a risk that climate-change mitigation 
aimed  at  achieving  stringent  climate  goals  could  negatively  affect  food  access  and  food  security 
(Akimoto et al. 2012; Fujimori et al. 2019; Hasegawa et al. 2018). If not managed properly, the risk of 
hunger due to climate policies such as large-scale bioenergy production increases remarkably if the 2 
C and 1.5 C targets are implemented (Section 3.7.1 in Chapter 3). Taking the highest median values 
from different IAMs for given classes of scenarios, up to 14.9 GtCO2 yr-1 carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
from BECCS is required in 2100, and 2.4 GtCO2 yr-1 for afforestation. Across the different scenarios, 
median changes in global forest area throughout the 21st century reach the required 7.2 Mkm2 increases 
between 2010 and 2100, and agricultural land used for second-generation bioenergy crop production 
may  require  up  to  6.6  Mkm2  in  2100,  increasing  the  competition  for  land  and  potentially  affecting 
sustainable development (AR6 scenarios database). 
 
Reducing climate change can reduce the share of the global population exposed to increased stress from 
reductions in water resources (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014) and therefore to water scarcity as defined 
by a cumulative abstraction-to-demand ratio (Hanasaki et al. 2013). Byers et al. (2018), show that 8–
14% of the population will be exposed to severe reductions in  water supply if average temperatures 
increase between 1.5 and 2.0 C (also see Section 3.7.2 in Chapter 3). Hayashi et al. (2018) assess the 
water availability for different emission pathways, including the 2C and 1.5C targets, in light of the 
various factors governing availability. There are very different impacts among nations. In Afghanistan, 
Pakistan  and  South  Africa,  water  stress is  estimated to  increase  by  2050 mainly  due  to  increases  in 
irrigation water associated with the rising demand for food, and climate change will already increase 
water stress within the next decades. Other factors, such as changes in the demand for municipal water, 
water for electricity generation, other industrial water and water for livestock due to climate change 
mitigation, are of limited importance. 
 
Vandyck  et  al.  (2018)  estimate  that  the  2C  pathway  would  reduce  air  pollution  and  avoid  0.7–1.5 
million  premature  deaths  in  2050  compared  to  current  levels.  It  is  generally  agreed  that  in  both 
developed and developing countries there are additional benefits of climate change mitigation in terms 
of improved air quality (Section 3.7.4 in Chapter 3). Markandya et al. (2018) assessed the health co-
benefits  of  air  pollution  reductions  and  the  mitigation  costs  of  the  Paris  Agreement  using  global 
scenarios for up to 2050. They concluded that the health co-benefits substantially outweighed the policy 
costs of achieving the NDC targets and either 2°C or 1.5°C stabilization. The ratio of health co-benefits 
to the mitigation costs ranged from 1.4 to 2.45, depending on the scenario. The extra effort of trying to 
pursue the 1.5°C target instead of the 2°C target would generate a substantial net benefit in some areas.

In India, the co-health benefits were valued at USD3.28–8.4 trillion and those in China at USD0.27–
2.31 trillion. Gi et al. (2019) also show that developing countries such as India have a huge potential to 
produce co-benefits. In addition, this implies that while the cost advantages of simultaneously achieving 
reductions of CO2 emissions and of PM2.5 are clear, the advantages for integrated measures could be 
limited, as the costs greatly depend on the CO2 emissions reduction target. 
 
Grubler et al. (2018) models a pathway leading to global temperature change of less than 1.5C without 
CCS,  taking  end-use  changes  into  account,  including  innovations  in  information  technologies  and 
changes to consumer behaviour apart from passive consumption. The pathway estimates global final-
energy demand of 245 EJ/yr in 2050, which is much lower than in existing studies (also see Section 
5.3.3  in  Chapter  5).  It  also  shows  the  possibilities  of  creating  synergies  between  multiple  SDGs, 
including hunger, health, energy access and land-use. Integrated technological and social innovations 
will  increase  the  opportunity  to  achieve  sustainable  development.  Millward-Hopkins  et  al.  (2020) 
estimates  global  final  energy  at  149  EJ/yr  in  2050  as  required  to  provide  decent  material  living 
standards, which is much lower than the 1.5 C scenario ranges (330−480 EJ/yr in 2050) of IAMs (IPCC 
2018) and the 390 EJ/yr in the IEA SDS (IEA 2019), and also lower than Grubler et al. (2018). The 
conclusion is that, although providing material living standards does not guarantee that every person 
will  live  a  good  life,  there  are  large  potentials  in  achieving  low  energy  demand  with  sustainable 
development. 
 
An overview of the co-benefits and trade-offs of several SDGs based on modelling results is provided 
in Figure 3.39 (Section 3.7 in Chapter 3). Selected mitigation co-benefits and trade-offs are provided in 
relation to meeting the 1.5 degree temperature goal based on a subset of models and scenarios, despite 
many IAMs so far not having comprehensive coverage of the sustainable development goals (Rao et al. 
2017; van Soest et al. 2019). There are several co-benefits of mitigation policies, including increased 
forest  cover  (SDG  15)  and  reduced  mortality  from  ambient  PM2.5  pollution  (SDG  3)  compared  to 
reference scenarios. However, mitigation policies can also cause higher food prices and thus increase 
the share of the global population at risk from hunger (SDG 2), while also relying on solid fuels (SDGs 
7 & 3) as side effects. It is then concluded in Section 3.7 of  Chapter 3, that these trade-offs can be 
balanced  through  targeted  support  measures  and/or  additional  SD  policies  (Bertram  et  al.  2018; 
Cameron et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2019).  
 
The World in 2050 Initiative (TWI) includes a comprehensive assessment of technologies, economies 
and  societies  embodied  in  the  SDGs  (IIASA  2018).  The  assessment  addresses  social  dynamics, 
governance  and  sustainable  development  pathways  within  the  areas  of  human  capacity  and 
demography, consumption and production, decarbonization and energy, food, the biosphere and water, 
smart cities and digitalization. The report concludes that the 17 SDGs are integrated and complementary 
and need to be addressed in unison. Studies using global IAMs that were presented in the GEO6 report 
(United Nations Environment Programme 2019, Chapter 22) concluded that transitions to low-carbon 
pathways  will  require  a  broad  portfolio  of  measures,  including  a  mixture  of  technological 
improvements,  lifestyle  changes  and  localized  solutions.  The  many  different  challenges  require 
dedicated measures to improve access to, for example, food, water and energy, while at the same time 
reducing  the  pressure  on  environmental  resources  and  ecosystems.  A  key  contribution  may  be  a 
redistribution of access to resources, where both physical access and affordability play a role. The IAMs 
cover large countries and regions, and localized solutions are not properly addressed in the modelling 
results. This implies that, for example, trade-offs between energy access and affordability are not fully 
represented in aggregate modelling results. 
 
There  are  also  several  country-level  studies  for  deep  emissions  reductions  (see  Chapter  4  for  an 
overview of the results). The studies find significant impacts of mitigation policies at the sectoral level, 
reflecting the fact that the sectoral scope does not allow for as much flexibility in mitigation measures 
the  despite  macroeconomic  impacts  being  assessed  to  be  small  (Executive  Summary  in  Chapter  4). 
Another  key  lesson  is  that  the  detailed  design  of  mitigation  policies  is  critical  for  the  distributional 
impacts (Executive Summary in Chapter 4). The potential mitigation measures, the potential economic

growth,  the  political  priorities  and  so  forth  are  different  among  nations,  and  there  may  be  several 
emissions reduction transition pathways to long-term goals among nations (Figure 4.2 in Chapter 4). 
 
17.3.2.2 Renewable energy penetration and fossil-fuel phase-out 
As  pointed  out  in  Chapter  6,  the  achievement  of  long-term  temperature  goals  in  line  with  the  Paris 
Agreement requires the rapid penetration of renewable energy and a timely phasing out of fossil fuels, 
especially coal, from the global energy system. Limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot 
means that global CO2 emissions must reach “net zero” in 2050/2060 (IPCC 2018). Net zero emissions 
imply that fossil fuel use is minimised and replaced by renewables and other low-carbon primary forms 
of energy, or that the residual emissions from fossil fuels are offset by carbon dioxide removal. The 
1.5°C scenario requires a 2-3% annual improvement rate in carbon intensities till 2050. The historical 
record only shows a slight improvement in the carbon intensity rate of global energy supplies, far from 
what is required to limit likely global warming to 2°C, or limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot.  
 
The role of coal in the global energy system is changing fast. Given the global temperature goals of the 
Paris Agreement, the global coal sector needs a transition to near zero by 2050  – earlier in some regions 
(Bauer et al. 2018; IEA 2017; IPCC 2018). Other global trends, including air quality, water shortages, 
the  improved  cost  efficiencies  of  renewables,  the  technical  availability  of  energy  storage  and  the 
economic rebalancing of emerging countries, are also driving global coal consumption t to  a plateau 
followed by a reverse (Sator 2018; Spencer et al. 2018). The world should be prepared for a managed 
transition away from coal and should identify appropriate transition options for the future of coal, which 
can include both the penetration of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency (Shah et 
al. 2015).  
 
Phasing out fossil fuels from energy systems is technically possible and is estimated to be relatively 
low in cost (Chapter 6). The cost of low-carbon alternatives, including onshore and offshore wind, solar 
PV and electric vehicles, has been reduced substantially in recent years and has become competitive 
with fossil fuels (Shen et al. 2020). However, studies show that replacing fossil fuels with renewables 
can have major synergies and trade-offs with a broader agenda of sustainable development (Swain and 
Karimu 2020), including land use and food security (McCollum et al. 2018), decent jobs and economic 
growth  (Swain  and  Karimu  2020).  Clarke  et  al.  (2014:Table  6.7)  provides  detailed  mapping  of  the 
sectoral  co-benefits  and  adverse  side-impacts  of  and  links  to  transformation  pathways.  In  Section 
17.3.3.7 in this chapter, this is supplemented with a mapping of the synergies and trade-offs between 
the deployment of renewable energy and the SDGs.  
 
The general conclusion is that the potential co-benefits of renewable energy end-use measures outweigh 
the  adverse  impacts  in  most  sectors  and  in  relation  to  the  SDGs,  though  this  is  not  the  case  for  the 
AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses) sectors. Some locally negative economic impacts 
can result in increased energy costs and competition over land areas and water resources. Some sectors 
may also experience increasing unemployment as a consequence of the transition process. Although the 
deployment of renewable energy will generate a new industry and associated jobs and benefits in some 
areas and economies, these impacts will often not directly replace or offset activities in areas that have 
been heavily dependent on the fossil-fuel industry.  
 
The transition to low emission pathways will require policy efforts that also address the emissions that 
are locked into existing infrastructure like power plants, factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure 
already  in  use:  for  example,  today  coal-fired  power  plants  account  for  30%  of  all  energy-related 
emissions (IEA 2019). Over the past twenty years, Asia has accounted for 90% of all coal-fired capacity 
built  worldwide,  and  these  plants  have  potentially  long  operational  lifetimes  ahead  of  them.  In 
developing economies in Asia, existing coal-fired plants are just twelve years old on average. There are 
three options for bringing down emissions from the existing stock of plants: to retrofit them with carbon 
capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) or biomass co-firing equipment; to repurpose them to focus on 
providing system adequacy and flexibility while reducing operations; and to retire them early. In the

IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, most of the 2080 GW of existing coal-fired capacity would be 
affected by one of these three options.  
 
Even though the transition away from fossil fuels is desirable and technically feasible, it is still largely 
constrained  by  existing  fossil  fuel-based  infrastructure  and  stranded  investments.  The  “committed” 
emissions from existing fossil-fuel infrastructure may consume all the remaining carbon budget in the 
1.5°C scenario, or two thirds of the carbon budget in the 2°C scenario (Tong et al. 2019). Kefford et al. 
(2018) assess the early retirement of fossil-fuel power plants in the US, EU, China and India based on 
the IEA 2°C scenario and conclude that a massive early retirement of coal-fired power plants is needed, 
and that two to three standard 500 MW generators will need to come offline every week for fifteen 
years. This high rate is the result of a very large deployment of coal-fired power plants from 2004 to 
2012. The early phasing out of this infrastructure will result in a significant share of stranded assets 
(Ansari and Holz 2020) with an impact on workers, local communities, companies and governments 
(van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020). The challenge is thus to manage a transition which delivers the rapid 
phasing out of existing fossil fuel-based infrastructure while also developing a new energy system based 
on low-carbon alternatives within a very short window of opportunity. 
 
Chapter 6 similarly concludes that the transition towards a high penetration of renewable systems faces 
various  challenges  in  the  technical,  environmental  and  socio-economic  fields.  The  integration  of 
renewables into the grid requires not only sufficient flexibility in power grids and intensive coordination 
with  other  sources  of  generation,  but  also  a  fundamental  change  in  long-term  planning  and  grid 
operation (see Chapter 6 for more details on these issues).  

Examples  from  various  countries  show  that,  compared  with  top-down  decision-making,  bottom-up 
policy-making involving local stakeholders could enable regions to benefit and reduce their resistance 
to transitions. Kainuma et al. (2012) conclude that social dialogue is a critical condition for engaging 
local workers and communities in managing the transitions with the necessary support from transition 
assistance. They also point out that macro-level policies, training programmes, participatory processes 
and specific programmes to support employment creation for workers in fossil fuel-dependent industries 
are needed.  
 
Examples of challenges in transitions away from using coal are given in Box 17.1.

Box 17.1 Case study: coal transitions 

 
The coal transition will pose challenges not only to the power sector, but even more importantly to coal-
mining. A less diversified local economy, low labour mobility and heavy dependence on coal revenues 
will make closing down coal production particularly challenging from a political economy perspective. 
Policy is needed to support and invest in impacted areas to smooth the transition, absorb the impact and 
incentivize  new  opportunities.  A  supportive  policy  for  the  transition  could  include  both  short-term 
support  and  long-term  investment.  Short-term  compensation  could  be  helpful  for  local  workers, 
communities,  companies  and  governments  to  manage  the  consequences  of  coal  closures.  Earlier 
involvement with local stakeholders using a structured approach is crucial and will make the transition 
policy more targeted and better administered. The long-term policy should target support to the local 
economy and workers to move beyond coal, including a strategic plan to transform the impacted area, 
investment  in  local  infrastructure  and  education,  and  preference  policies  to  incentivize  emerging 
businesses. Most importantly, ex-ante policy implementation is far better than ex-post compensation. 
Even  without  the  climate  imperative,  historical  evidence  shows  that  coal  closures  can  happen 
surprisingly fast. 
 
Coal has hitherto been the dominant energy source in China and has accounted for more than 70% of 
its total energy consumption for the past twenty years, falling to 64% in 2015 (The National BIM Report 
2018). In the 13th Five Year Plan (2016-2020), for the first time China included the target of a national 
coal consumption cap of 4.1 billion tons for 2020, as well as a goal of reducing the primary energy

share of coal to 58% by 2020 from the level of 64% in 2015 (The National People’s Congress of the 
People’s Republic of China 2016). The main driving forces of the coal transition in China are increasing 
domestic  environmental  concerns  and  the  pressure  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Coal 
combustion contributes about 90% of total SO2 emissions, 70% of NOx emissions and 54% of primary 
PM2.5 emissions in China (Yang and Teng 2018). The early phasing out of coal also delivers a co-
benefit  in  terms  of  reductions  of  air  pollutants  that  are  consistent  with  China’s  goal  to  improve  air 
quality (Zhang et al. 2019), as well as the reduction of methane (Teng et al. 2019) and black carbon 
(Zhang et al. 2019). The coal transition in China will change the future value of coal-related assets, and 
both  coal  power  generators  in  China  and  coal  producers  outside  China  need  to  identify  appropriate 
responses  to  avoid  and  manage  the  potentially  substantial  stranding  of  fossil-fuel  assets.  A  rapid 
transition away from coal is critical for China to reach the peak in its emissions (Cui et al. 2019). Despite 
the deployment of CCS and extending the use of coal, retrofitting CCS plant may be more expensive 
than deploying renewables (IEA 2019).  
 
Presently, coal-fired power plants play a key role in the German energy system, providing almost 46% 
of  the  electricity  consumed  in  Germany.  These  coal  power  plants  play  a  crucial  role  in  balancing 
fluctuations  in  producing  electricity  form  renewables  (Parra  et  al.  2019).  Political  and  economic 
considerations,  at  least  regionally,  are  also  of  great  importance  in  the  coal  sector  due  to  the 
approximately  35,000  people  employed  within  it  (including  coal-mining  and  the  power  stations 
themselves). For a long time, coal-fired power plants were able to protect their position in Germany, 
but  against  the  background  of  decreasing  public  acceptance,  economic  problems  resulting  from  the 
growing use of renewables and ambitious GHG reduction targets, the sector cannot resist the political 
pressures against them any longer. The governing parties have agreed to establish a commission called 
“Growth, structural change and employment” to develop a strategy for phasing out coal-fired power 
plants  (E3G  Annual  Review  2018).  This  Commission  consists  of  experts  and  stakeholders  from 
industry,  associations,  unions,  the  scientific  community,  pressure  groups  and  politicians.  Its 
establishment shows that the phasing-out process deserves close attention and that management policies 
must be implemented to ensure a soft landing for the electricity sector. 
END BOX 17.1 HERE 
 
The transition towards a high-penetration renewable system also raises concerns over the availability 
of rare metals for batteries like lithium and cobalt. While metal reserves are unlikely to limit the growth 
rate  or  total  amount  of  solar  and  wind  energy,  used  battery  technologies  and  the  known  reserves 
currently being exploited are not compatible with the transition scenario due to insufficient cobalt and 
lithium reserves (Månberger and Stenqvist 2018). Global lithium production rose by roughly 13 percent 
from 2016 to 2017 to 43,000 MT in 2018 (Golberg 2021). Africa has rich reserves of lithium and is 
expected to produce 15% of the world’s supply soon (Rosenberg et al. 2019). Such reserves are found 
in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa (Steenkamp 2017) and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (Roker 2018).  
 
The demand for these resources as ingredients in rechargeable batteries is growing rapidly, with global 
demand  for  cobalt  set  to  quadruple  to  over  190,000tn  by  2026.  The  DRC  is  a  mineral-rich  country 
(Smith et al. 2019a) with rich reserves of fossil fuels (coal and oil) (Buzananakova 2015). The extraction 
of  lithium  and  cobalt  can  be  environmentally  and  socially  damaging,  though  its  use  as  a  principal 
component in most rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles and electronic smart grids affords it high 
sustainability value. Chapter 10 includes a more detailed assessment of the issues with mining these 
rare metals, as well as the associated social problems, including exploitative working conditions and 
child labour, the latter a major issue that needs to be taken into consideration in transitions. Recycling 
batteries is also highlighted as a major supplementary policy if negative environmental side impacts are 
to be avoided (Rosendahl and Rubiano 2019). In the future, more attention should be paid to reducing 
vulnerability through subsidizing R&D in rare metals recycling, establishing systems to incentivize the 
collection  of  rare-metal  waste  and  promoting  technological  progress  using  abundant  metals  as  a 
replacement for rare metals (Rosendahl and Rubiano 2019).

Chapter 10 also provides a more detailed assessment of the issues involved in mining these rare metals, 
as well as the associated social problems, including exploitative working conditions and child labour, 
the latter a major issue that needs to be taken into consideration in transitions. Recycling batteries is

17.3.2.3 Stranded assets, inequality and just transitions 
As  the  momentum  towards  achieving  carbon  neutrality  grows,  the  risk  of  certain  assets  becoming 
stranded  is  on  the  increase.  International  policies  and  the  push  for  low-carbon  technologies  in  the 
context of climate change are reducing the demand for and value of fossil-fuel products. Stranded assets 
become devalued before the end of their economic life or can no longer be monetised due to changes in 
policies  and  regulatory  frameworks,  technological  change,  security,  or  environmental  disruption.  In 
short,  stranded  assets  are  “assets  that  have  suffered  from  unanticipated  or  premature  write-down, 
devaluations or conversions to liabilities” (Caldecott et al. 2013).  
 
Stranded assets are likely to “lose economic value ahead of their anticipated useful life” (Bos and Gupta 
2019).  They  are  often  described  as  creative  when  they  become  stranded  because  of  innovation, 
competition  or  economic  growth (Gupta  et  al.  2020). Divestment  refers to  “the action  or  process  of 
selling off subsidiary business interests or investments.’’ This often occurs due to changing social norms 
and perceptions of climate change.  
 
Indeed,  pressure  is  mounting  on  fossil-fuel  industries  to  remove  their  capital  from  heavy  carbon 
industries.  As  the  former  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  England,  Mark  Carney,  remarked,  a  wholesale 
reassessment of prospects, especially if it were to occur suddenly, could potentially destabilise markets, 
sparking a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and a persistent tightening of financial conditions. In 
other  words,  an  abrupt  resolution  to  the  tragedy  of  horizons  itself  poses  a  risk  to  financial  stability 
(OECD  2015).  The  divestment  narrative  is  also  based  on  the  view  that  a  shift  away  from  intensive 
carbon  resources  will  be  significant,  as  the  “less  value  will  be  destroyed,  […]  the  more  can  be  re-
invested in low carbon infrastructure’(OECD 2015). Social movements are critical to triggering rapid 
transformational change and moving away from dangerous levels of climate change (Mckibben 2012). 
Although  divestment  is  hailed  as  a  necessary  action  to  decouple  fossil  fuel  from  growth  and  force 
carbon-intensive industries to go out of business, there is the sense that there is no shortage of investors 
who are willing to buy shares, so that such resources are not stranded, but simply relocated. Criticism 
has been levelled at the divestment movement for not having a significant impact on funding fossil fuels 
and  not  being  sufficiently  in  tune  with  other  wide-ranging  complexities  that  go  beyond  the  moral 
dimensions (Bergman 2018). Despite being labelled a ‘moral entrepreneur’, the divestment movement 
has the potential to disrupt current practices in the fossil-fuel industry, shape a ‘disruptive innovation’ 
and  contribute  to  a  strategy  for  decarbonising  economies  globally  (Bergman  2018).  Divestment  is 
contributing to the political situation that is ‘weakening the political and economic stronghold of the 
fossil fuel industry’ (Grady-Benson and Sarathy 2016).  
 
The risks attached to the stranding of fossil-fuel assets have increased with the recent and sustained 
plunge in oil prices because of the global health pandemic (COVID-19) and the concomitant economic 
downturn,  forcing  demand  to  plummet  to  unprecedentedly  low  levels.  (Oil  prices  have  recently 
increased). Many  economies  in  transition  and  countries  dependent  on  fossil  fuels  are  going through 
turbulent times where asset and transition management will be critical  (UNEP/SEI  2020). However, 
COVID-19  provides  a  foretaste  of  what  a  low-carbon  transition  could  look  like,  especially  if  assets 
become stranded in an effort to respond to the call for action in ‘building back better’ and putting clean 
energy  jobs  and  the  just  transition  at  the  heart  of  the  post-COVID-19  recovery  (IEA  2020;  United 
Nations General Assembly 2021). COVID-19 provides a useful proxy for issuing two alerts. First, it is 
a  reminder  of  the  urgency  of  addressing  climate  change,  given  that  delaying  the  move  away  from 
stranded assets will further worsen climate change. Second, failure to recognize the threat from stranded 
assets will result in new assets becoming stranded (Rempel and Gupta 2021). Hence, the momentum 
towards a transformational push is resting on a new opportunity ushered in by COVID-19 to emphasize 
the urgency for a new departure towards rapid emissions reductions (Cronin et al. 2021).

The stranded assets narrative has focused overwhelmingly on consumption  by companies: not much 
emphasis has been placed on the commercialisation- and investment-related aspects. In addition, other 
carbon-intensive activities can also run the risk of being stranded, such as cement, petrochemicals, steel 
and  aviation  (Baron  and  David  2015).  This  is  why  stranded  assets  are  often  referred  to  as  having  a 
cascading impact on several other sectors. 
 
Transitions  are  broad-based  and  complex,  involving  governance  structures,  institutions  and  climate 
vulnerabilities,  and  there  is  need  to  include  historical  responsibility,  resource  intensity  and  capacity 
differentials, thus relegating the debate across simplistic binary lines of developed versus developing 
countries (Carney 2016). Hence, transition processes will have to respond to several preconditions and 
structural inequalities related to climate finance, energy poverty, vulnerabilities and the broader macro-
economic implications associated with managing the debt burden, fiscal deficits and uneven terms of 
development in developing countries. In addition to structural inequalities, the COVID-19 pandemic 
has severely disrupted energy and food systems to and reduced the speed at which developing countries 
can procure new low-carbon technologies and decouple economic growth from fossil fuels (Winkler 
2020). For instance, global supply-chain transition costs might be lower when compared to in-country 
supply  chains,  as  became  evident  when  COVID-19  created  further  disruption  to  renewable  energy 
projects (Cronin et al. 2021). Moreover, developing countries can experience difficulties in phasing out 
old technologies, especially if the latter has a cost disadvantage, has not benefitted from an established 
track record and its performance is uncertain (Bos and Gupta 2019). There is the risk of lock-in effects 
related to grandfathering when emitters comply with less stringent standards. 

Despite their efforts in deploying renewable energies, many developing countries are still contending 
with  problems  related  to  the  immaturity  of  the  current  technologies  and  the  challenges  of  battery 
storage. In short, the transition to a low carbon development must consider the challenges of renewable 
energy  penetration  and  existing  energy-related  vulnerabilities  and  inequalities.  There  are  power 
asymmetries between first-comers and latecomers, especially in cases where mature technologies can 
be located in countries with less stringent laws and standards. Carbon leakage has implications for just 
transitions, as carbon-intensive industries can move their dirty industries to developing countries as a 
way of outsourcing the production of carbon (Bos and Gupta 2019; UNU-INRA 2020, Denton et al, 
2021). When the challenge of climate mitigation is transferred to developing countries in the form of 
carbon  leakage, the  risks  of  carbon  lock-in for  developing countries  are  heightened  (Bos  and  Gupta 
2019). 

Overcoming the carbon lock-in is not simply a matter of the right policies or switching to low-carbon 
technologies. Indeed, it would mean a radical change in the existing power relations between fossil-fuel 
industries and their governments and social structural behaviour (Seto et al. 2016). Some actions to fix 
the  climate  change  problem  can  themselves  create  injustices,  thereby  challenging  sustainable 
development (Cronin et al. 2021). Not paying sufficient attention to perceptions of injustice related to 
the  rights  to  development,  energy  and  resource  sovereignty  can  further  create  resistance  to  climate 
action (Cronin et al. 2021).  

The shrinking carbon budget has raised questions over whether to meet our commitment to 2 degrees 
Celsius if fossil-fuel resources were to be mined or left stranded, as McGlade and Ekins argue: '… [a] 
large portion of the reserve base and an even more significant proportion of the resource base should 
not be produced if the temperature rise is to remain below 2 degrees C’ (McGlade and Ekins 2015). 
This logic means that developing countries that rely on fossil-fuel extraction will need to replace their 
hydrocarbon  revenues  with  other  income-generating  activities.  Stranded  assets  remind  most  oil-
producing governments that fossil-fuel assets do not have a durable value and are vulnerable to politico-
economic forces and fluctuations. The goal of staying within the 1.5°C temperature goal, in line with 
the Paris Agreement, is already part of the policy vision and planning of large fossil fuel-consuming 
economies. For early fossil-fuel producers, however, the reality that their resources may not yield the

desired returns is often perceived as bad news, particularly in the context of the increasing depreciation 
of fossil-fuel products. 
 
Stranded assets raise fundamental questions related to issues of equity and just transitions: 
 

•  Who decides which resources should be stranded? 
•  Who shoulders the burden of the transition and losses incurred from moving away from heavy 

industries with associated compensation? 

•  How  should  the  advantages  of  short-term  fossil-fuel  exploitation  be  shared  based  on  the 

principle of distributive justice? 

 
The transition to a low-carbon development is wired in issues of justice and equity: how do you align 
carbon reductions to meet the needs of humanity? Distributive justice calls for a fairer sharing of the 
benefits and burdens of the transition process, while procedural justice is essentially about ensuring that 
the demands of vulnerable groups are not ignored in the pull to the transition. The impacts of climate 
change  and  the  mitigation  burdens  are  experienced  differently  by  different  social  actors,  with 
indigenous  communities  facing  multiple  threats  and  being  subjected  to  unequal  power  dynamics 
(Sovacool 2021).  
 
Nonetheless, the production of fossil fuels is central to many economies with numerous development 
implications related to rents associated with export revenues, energy security and poverty alleviation 
(Lazarus and van Asselt 2018). The central question is who decides which types of carbon should be 
burnable or non-burnable. Hence, social equality is at the heart of the transition process, but it falls short 
of a response on how to chart a new road map towards carbon neutrality, especially given that fossil-
fuel  producers  and  investors  tend  to  belong  to  large,  powerful  companies  and  wield  a  great  deal  of 
influence and power, especially when their entrenched interests are at stake (Lazarus and van Asselt 
2018).  The  question  of  whether  developing  countries  should  be  compensated  for  foregoing  their 
resources in light of their current development needs has not yielded many results and had only limited 
success  in  mobilising  international  finance,  as  demonstrated  by  the  case  of  Yasuni-ITT  in  Ecuador 
(Sovacool and  Scarpaci  2016).  According to  Sovacool  et  al.  (2021),  affected  communities  and  their 
views may be discounted and excluded from planning, which can neglect important matters such as 
rights, recognition and representation (Sovacool 2021).  
 
Fossil  fuel-dependent  countries  are  doubly  exposed  to  the  vulnerability  related  to  climate-change 
impacts and are being targeted in the global effort to address the problem (Peszko et al. 2020). Countries 
that are heavily reliant on oil, coal and gas are also those most at risk from a low-carbon transition that 
may  curtail  the  activities  of  their  fossil-fuel  industries  and  render  the  value  chains  and  economies 
associated with the exploitation of fossil fuels unviable (Peszko et al. 2020). 
 
Developing countries in Latin America and Africa that are reliant on revenue streams from fossil fuels 
may  not  see these returns converted into much  needed  infrastructure and other social and economic 
amenities  that  can  reduce  poverty.  However,  given  the  falling  prices  of  renewables,  developing 
countries do not have to face the burden of retrofitting their infrastructure to align with new low-carbon 
industries, since they can leapfrog technologies and shape a sustainable trajectory that is more resilient 
and fit for the future. 
 
However, the transition towards a carbon-neutral world is complex and non-linear, and it will likely 
result in some disruptions, with manifest equality implications, given the scale of the transformation 
envisaged. There are parallel movements that can be observed. On the one hand, divestment initiatives 
are underway to move away from carbon-intensive investments. On the other hand, hydrocarbon-rich 
countries in some parts of the developing world are identifying new opportunities to reduce the fiscal 
loss associated with the loss of fossil-fuel revenues. Indeed, with global investment in energy expected 
to shrink by 20% this year, this has created fiscal challenges for countries that are heavily reliant on 
fossil-fuel products as their main source of revenue.

Other disruptions are linked to redundant contracts and postponed or cancelled explorations, as many 
oil companies are diversifying their production in the wake of the pandemic and are cutting back on 
planned hydrocarbon investments (Denton et al, 2021). These failed concessions and disruptions have 
implications for the just transition, especially in developing countries without the financial ability to 
pull out of fossil fuels and to diversify with the same urgency as the industrialized nations (Peszko et 
al. 2020). For instance, in South Africa, which is seeking to divest away from coal and decarbonize its 
energy sector, if the transition is not properly managed, this could lead to a loss in  revenue of R1.8 
trillion  (USD125  billion),  thus  compromising  the  government’s  ability  to  support  social  spending 
(Huxham  et  al.  2019).  Emerging  oil  producers  like  Uganda  are  having  to  postpone  the  start  of 
production. Eni and Total, two of the largest international oil and gas majors in Africa, have already 
signalled  they  are  making  25%  cuts  to  their  investment  in  exploration  and  production  projects  in 
2020, representing a €4bn reduction in foreign direct investment for Total and a USD2bn reduction for 
Eni (Le Bec 2020).  
 
A poorly managed transition will reproduce inequalities, thus contradicting the very essence of a just, 
sustainable, inclusive transition. Revenues from oil and gas have been ploughed into social safety nets 
and  are  supporting  free  senior  high-school  education  in  countries  such  as  Ghana,  thus  enabling  the 
realisation of SDG 4 on quality education (UNU-INRA 2020). The move from fossil fuels towards a 
low-carbon  economy  has  economic  implications  for  lower  income  countries  that  are  dependent  on 
hydrocarbon resources, are endowed with significant untapped oil and gas reserves, and may not have 
the transitional tools to move towards low-carbon technologies or economies (Peszko et al. 2020). 
 
The energy transition landscape is changing rapidly, and we are witnessing multiple transitions. This 
creates room to manage the transition in ways that will prioritise the need for workers in vulnerable 
sectors (land, energy) to secure their jobs and to maintain a secure and healthy lifestyle, especially as 
the risks multiply for those who are exposed to heavy industrial jobs and all the associated outcomes. 
The shift to carbon neutrality is being driven by convergent factors related to energy security and the 
benefits  of  climate  mitigation,  including  the  health  impacts  of  air  pollution  and  consumer  demand 
(Svobodova et al. 2020).  
 
Climate change is high on the global agenda, as is energy’s role in decarbonizing the economy, giving 
rise to a number of equality issues. Oswald et al. (2020) have shown that economic inequality translates 
into  inequality  in  energy  consumption,  as  well  as  emissions.  This  is  largely  because  people  with 
different levels of purchasing power make use of different goods and services, which are sustained by 
different energy quantities and carriers (Oswald et al. 2020; Poblete-Cazenave et al. 2021) 
 
A study by Bai et al. (2020) shows that an increase in income inequality in China hinders the carbon 
abatement effect of innovations in renewable energy technologies, possibly even leading to an increase 
in carbon emissions, while a decrease in inequality of incomes is conducive to giving play to the role 
of this carbon abatement effect, thereby indicating that there is an important correlation between the 
goals of “sustainable social development” and “sustainable ecological development”.  
 
India is home to one sixth of world’s population but accounts for only 6.8% of global energy use and 
consumes only 5.25% of electricity produced globally. During the period 1990–1991 to 2014–2015, 
overall energy intensity in India declined from 0.007 Mtoe per billion INR of GDP to 0.004 Mtoe per 
billion  INR  of  GDP,  an  annual  average  decline  of  2%.  The  industrial  sector  is  making  the  highest 
contribution CO2 mitigation by reducing its energy intensity (Roy et al. 2021).  
 
Household  carbon  emissions  are  mainly  affected  by  incomes  and  other  key  demographic  factors. 
Understanding  the  contribution  of  these  factors  can  inform  climate  responsibilities  and  potential 
demand-side climate-mitigation strategies. A study by Feng et al. (2021) on inequalities in household 
carbon the in USA shows that the per-capita carbon footprint (CF) of the highest income group (>200 
thousand USD per year) with 32.3 tons is about 2.6 times the per-capita CF of the lowest income group 
(<15 thousand USD) with 12.3 tons. Most contributors of high carbon footprints across income groups

Studies by Jaccard et al. (2021) on energy in Europe shown a top-to-bottom decile ratio (90:10) of 7.2 
for expenditure, 3.1 for net energy and 2.6 for carbon. Given such inequalities, these two targets can 
only be met through the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS), large efficiency improvements and 
an extremely low minimum final energy use of 28 GJ per adult equivalent. Assuming a more realistic 
minimum energy use of about 55 GJ ae−1 and no CCS deployment, the 1.5◦C target can only be achieved 
at near full equality. The authors conclude that achieving both stated goals is an immense and widely 
underestimated challenge, the successful management of which requires far greater room for manoeuvre 
in monetary and fiscal terms than is reflected in the current European political discourse. 
 
The  ‘Just  Transition’  concept  has  evolved  over  the  years  (Sweeney  and  Treat  2018)  and  is  still 
undergoing further  evolution.  It  emphasizes the  key  principles  of  respect  and  dignity  for  vulnerable 
groups, the creation of decent jobs, social protection, employment rights, fairness in energy access and 
use, and social dialogue and democratic consultation with relevant stakeholders, whilst coping with the 
effects of asset-stranding or the transition to green and clean economies. The concept has come under 
increased scrutiny, with its protagonists emphasizing the need to focus on the equality of the transition, 
not simply on its speed (Forsyth 2014). The emphasis on justice is also gaining in momentum, with a 
growing recognition that the sustainability transition is about justice in the transition and not simply 
about economics (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Swilling, M. Annecke 2010; Williams and Doyon 2020). 
Scholars are increasingly of the view that a transition  involving low-carbon development should not 
replace old forms of injustice with new ones (Setyowati 2021).  
 
The economic implications of the transition will be felt by developing countries with high degrees of 
dependence  on  hydrocarbon  products  as  a  revenue  stream,  as  they  are  exposed  to  reduced  fiscal 
incomes, given the low demand for oil and low oil prices and the associated economic fallout of the 
pandemic. This link with stranded assets is important, but it may be overlooked, as countries whose 
assets are becoming stranded may not have the relevant resources, knowledge, autonomy or agency to 
design  a  fresh  orientation  or  decide  on  the  transition.  In  addition,  some  developing  countries  are 
dependent not only on fossil-fuel revenues, but also on foreign exchange earnings from exports. This 
dependence  comes  into  sharp  focus  when  one  considers  that  30%  of  the  Malaysian  government’s 
revenues are linked to petroleum products, and that Mozambique, by exploiting its newly discovered 
natural-gas reserves, can earn seven times the country’s current GDP over a period of 25 years (Cronin 
et al. 2021). Thus, any attempt to accelerate the transition to low-carbon development must take into 
account  foreign  exchange,  domestic  revenue  and  employment  generation,  which  are  precisely  what 
ensure the attractiveness of fossil-fuel industries (Addison and Roe 2018).  

Energy use and its deployment are sovereign matters. State responsibilities over the control and use of 
natural resources concern both current and future generations (Carney 2016). Climate-change impacts 
will  disable  the  food,  water  and  energy  systems  of  the  most  vulnerable.  Therefore,  the  resources 
required to enable a just transition are predicated on good leadership and governance institutions that 
will support quality and justice-based transitions. Beyond energy systems, changes to land systems can 
benefit from sustainable land management in ways that will reduce the pressure on land for food and at 
the  same  time  support  carbon  storage.  With  land  coming  under  increased  pressure,  land  and  forest 
management  are  critical  for  carbon  sequestration,  as  well  as  other  ecosystem  benefits.  Extractive 
processes have impacts on land, and often there are few if any redistributive benefits for communities 
in  regions  where  extraction  takes  place.  In  addition,  extraction  of  strategic  minerals  such  as  cobalt, 
copper and lithium have been linked to violence, human rights abuses and conflict (Cronin et al. 2021).  

However, in the race to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, some of the other priorities of the transition, 
like climate-change adaptation and its inherent vulnerabilities, might become muted, given the urgency 
to  mitigate  at  all  costs.  Consequently,  the  transition  imperative  reduces  the  scope  for  local  priority-
setting and ignores the additional risks faced by countries with the least capacity to adapt. Equally, the

‘just transition’ is often seen through the prism of job losses and the attendant retooling and reskilling 
imperatives necessary to re-dynamize local businesses, especially those that may fail as a result of mine 
closures. It is equally important to consider current disparities in knowledge and capacity which could 
maintain the existing inequalities in the global regional distribution of costs and benefits. One striking 
example is the manufacturing of PV in India when compared to manufacturing PV in China. In China, 
manufacturing  costs  are  lower  than  in  India,  as  are  import  tariffs  (Behuria  2020).  Similarly,  a  solar 
industry might have greater development prospects in one region than another given existing regional 
disparities in human capital, infrastructure, finance and technological development (Cronin et al. 2021).  
 
Low-carbon transitions and equality implications will depend on local contexts, regional priorities, the 
points of departure of different countries in the transition and the speed at which they will want to travel. 
Hence, timing and scope are important elements that are associated more with a quality transition than 
a race to the bottom. To date the debate has had some obvious blind spots, not least considerations of 
power, politics and political economy (Denton et al, 2021). Certainly, the transition will create winners 
and  losers,  as  well  as  stakeholders  that  can  frame  their  economic  interests  so  as  to  determine  the 
orientation, pace, timing and scope of the transition.  
 
The  determination  of  a  just  transition  is  complex  and  not  simply  dependent  on  the  allocation  of 
perceived risks or solutions, but rather on how risks and solutions are defined (Forsyth 2014). Acting 
urgently to achieve environmental solutions or meet transition imperatives has certain risks given the 
need to go beyond commonplace definitions of the just transition by emphasizing the distributive or 
procedural aspects. The framing of policies to align with fast and low-cost mitigation without paying 
sufficient attention to social and economic resilience creates its own potential risks and can enhance 
social  vulnerability  rather  than  address  it.  The  need  to  distribute  climate-change  solutions  must  not 
delegitimise appropriate economic growth strategies, nor indeed create  the  additional risks  of policy 
imposition. Perceptions of justice with regard to environmental problems and solutions matter equally. 
Hence, the types of transition pathway that are chosen may have equality implications. Mitigation at all 
costs,  if  done  “cheaply  and  crudely”,  can  create  additional  problems for social justice  and inclusive 
development (Forsyth 2014).  
 
The  assumption  that  the  benefits  of  mitigation  are  enough  to  offset  trade-offs  with  other  policy 
objectives can be questioned. If one accepts the argument that not all adaptation addresses vulnerability 
concerns (Kjellén 2006), and that some adaptation strategies can heighten  vulnerabilities if there are 
flaws in their design and implementation, then the same logic applies, namely that not all mitigation is 
necessarily beneficial. Hence the emphasis on the transition resulting from mitigation should be placed 
not only on speed or cost effectiveness, but also on legitimacy of the actions, and whether the transition 
is well designed or not. In short, justice is not always a shorthand for acting ethically, but rather a point 
of reasoning on what is considered legitimate. Planning for the transition often discounts human rights 
and social inclusivity that can occur as the result of a rapid transition. The emphasis should be placed 
on the management of the transition rather than the speed  – for instance, if in the rush to build new 
hydropower energy sources implies that populations are displaced, then this constitutes a human rights 
violation (Castro et al. 2016; Piggot et al. 2019).  
 
Ambitious climate goals can increase the urgency of mitigation and accelerate the speed at which carbon 
neutrality is achieved. However, if the transition is done with speed, then this will leave diversification 
efforts stymied, particularly in developing countries that are highly dependent on fossil-fuel revenue 
streams  (UNEP/SEI  2020).  Transition  decisions  and  policies  may  also  have  far-reaching  gendered 
implications, as the closure of mines is often linked to several ancillary businesses impacts where men 
are  laid  off  and  women  may  have  to  take  on  multiple  jobs  to  compensate  for  the  reduction  in  the 
household‘s income (Piggot et al. 2019; UNU-INRA 2020).  
  
A just transition holds out the prospects for alternative high-quality jobs, public-health improvements 
and an opportunity to focus on well-being and prosperity, with spill-over benefits to urban areas and 
economic  systems.  Nonetheless,  countries  that  transition  from  fossil  fuels  experience  different

challenges,  different  levels  of  dependence  and  have  different  capacities  to  transition.  There  will  be 
countries with lower capacity and higher dependence, and vice versa (UNEP/SEI 2020).  
 
Deciding on matters of justice is essential to the transition, and there are several inherent questions to 
consider  when  thinking  through  the  allocation  of  costs  and  benefits,  as  is  the  case  with  distributive 
justice. How matters are defined and who defines matters such as the timing of phasing out, prioritising 
which  energy  sources  need  to  be  phased  out  and  who  might  be  affected  are  all  political  economy 
questions (Piggot et al. 2019).  
 
Similarly,  when  considering  issues  of  procedural  justice,  there  are  matters  related  to  interests, 
participation  and  power  dynamics  that  are  essential  to  the  process,  but  that  might  also  subvert  the 
process,  depending  on  whose  rights,  whose  participation  and  whose  power  are  being  put  in 
jeopardy.(Forsyth 2014; Piggot et al. 2019). Hence, both distribution and procedure matter, as do inter-
generational and  intra-generational  equity  in  planning  transitions.  Six critical  variables  can shape  or 
inhibit  the  transition  process.  These  are  dependence,  timing,  capacity,  agency,  scope  and  inclusion 
(Denton et al, 2021).  
 
Dependence, or the extent to which a country may depend on revenue streams from fossil fuels, will 
determine their ability to manage the transition from fossil fuels. Countries who rely on  the proceeds 
from hydrocarbon resources as economic rents to support fiscal income and spending on public service-
related  needs  such  as  education,  health  and  infrastructure,  export  earnings  and  foreign  exchange 
reserves will have greater difficulties in foregoing their fossil-fuel resources.  
 
Timing:  the  transition  pathway  has  to  be  aligned  with  a  timetable  which  is  anchored  in  national 
development priorities. For example, South Africa’s Integrated Resource Planning indicates that the 
transition away from coal, if not aligned with national development priorities, will reproduce new forms 
of inequality. In addition, if the transition is imposed and its timing is not organic, then this might also 
produce social inequalities.  
 
Capacity: Transitions need to reflect spaces and planning. If knowledge about the transition pathway 
is not adequately mastered or in place, this can disable the process or steer it in the wrong direction. 
Capacity also relates to several attributes, including technical, governance, institutional, technologies, 
economic resources to manage the transition. Poorer countries will have difficulties in managing all 
these resources, as well as absorbing the costs associated with the transition (UNEP/SEI 2020).  
 
Agency: transitions are inherently about the sovereign right to determine one’s orientation towards low-
carbon  development.  However,  given  the  urgency  to  stick  to  the  Paris  Agreement  and  the  new 
conditionalities  related  to  post-COVID  stimulus  packages,  the  absence  of  agency  to  deal  with  the 
transition might jeopardize its flow, orientation and pace (Newell and Mulvaney 2013).  
 
Scope: the extent to which the transition is rolled out and its potential impacts. If transition policies are 
ambitious in making commensurate diversification investments, this may enable job creation, but it may 
also affect employees who are insufficiently prepared to undertake new jobs and skills. 
 
Inclusion. Who is considered in the transition process and how their interests and risks are assessed are 
important  aspects  of  transition  pathways.  Stakeholders  with  strong  vested  interests  may  resist  the 
transition, especially as it moves towards diversification activities and policies. 
 
17.3.3 Cross-sectoral transitions  

Transitions will involve multiple sectoral- and cross-sectoral policies. Section 17.3.3 presents a range 
of studies and conclusions on the relationship between climate-change mitigation goals and meeting the 
SDGs in order to identify major synergies and trade-offs. The interactions are manifold and complex 
(Section 4.3.1.2 in Section 4; Nilsson et al. 2016; Pradhan et al. 2017). Here we draw on conclusions 
from sectoral chapters and add additional studies as a basis for drawing more general conclusions about

agriculture,  food  and  land-use,  the  water-energy-food  nexus,  industry,  cities,  infrastructure  and 
transportation, cross-sectoral digitalization, and mitigation and adaptation relations. 

 
17.3.3.1 Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) 
Sustainable development and mitigation policies are closely linked in the agriculture, food and land-
use  sectors.  We  assess  synergies  and  trade-offs  between  meeting  the  SDGs  and  reducing  GHG 
emissions  within the  sectors  based  on modelling studies  and case  studies illustrating how  trade-offs 
between SDG 2 (zero hunger, biomass for energy) and SDG 15 (life on land) can be addressed by cross-
sectoral mitigation options. 
 
Chapter 7 emphasizes the high expectations on land to deliver mitigation, yet the pressures on land have 
grown  with  population,  dietary  changes,  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  the  conversion  of 
uncultivated  land  to  agriculture  and  other  land  uses.  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Other  Land  Uses 
(AFOLU) are expected to play a vital role in the portfolio of mitigation options across all sectors. The 
AFOLU sector is also the only one in which it is currently feasible to achieve carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) from the atmosphere, including A/R, improved forest management and soil carbon sequestration 
(see Chapters 7 and 12). The AFOLU sector has a significant mitigation potential, with many scenarios 
showing a shift to net negative CO2 emissions during the 21st century. Total cumulative AFOLU CO2 
sequestration varies widely across scenarios, with as much as 415 GtCO2 being sequestered between 
2010  and  2100  in  the  most  stringent  mitigation  scenarios.  The  largest  share  of  net  GHG  emissions 
reductions from AFOLU in both the 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios is from forestry-related measures, such 
as  afforestation,  reforestation  and  reduced  deforestation.  Afforestation,  reforestation  and  forest 
management result in substantial carbon dioxide removal in many scenarios. CO2 and CH4 show larger 
and  more  rapid  declines  than  N2O,  an  indication  of  the  difficulties  of  reducing  N2O  emissions  in 
agriculture (Chapter 3). 
 
The  Global  Assessment  on  Biodiversity  and  Ecosystem  Services  Report  (IPBES  2019,  Chapter  5) 
assessed the relationship between meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 
7 (affordable and clean energy) and 15 (life on land). It concluded that a large expansion of the amount 
of land used for bioenergy production would not be compatible with these SDGs. However, combining 
bioenergy  options  with  other  mitigation  options,  like  more  efficient  land  management  and  the 
restoration  of  nature,  could  contribute  to  welfare  improvements  and  to  accessing  food  and  water. 
Demand-side  climate-mitigation  measures,  like  energy-efficiency  improvements,  reduced  meat 
consumption  and  reduced  food  waste,  were  considered  to  be  the  most  economically  attractive  and 
efficient  options  in  order  to  support  low  GHG  emissions,  food  security  and  biodiversity  objectives. 
Implementing  such  options,  however,  can  involve  challenges  in  terms  of  lifestyle  changes  (IPBES 
2019).  
 
The potential joint contribution of food and land-use systems to sustainable development and climate 
change has also been addressed in policy programmes by the UN, local governments and the private 
sector. These programmes address options for pursuing sustainable development and climate change 
jointly,  such  as  agroforestry,  agricultural  intensification,  better  agriculture  practices  and  avoided 
deforestation. Griggs and Stafford-Smith (2013) assess production- and consumption-based methods of 
achieving joint sustainability and climate-change mitigation in food systems, concluding that efficiency 
improvements in agricultural production systems can provide large benefits. Given the expectations of 
high levels of population growth and the strong increase in the demand for meat and dairy products, 
there is also a need for the careful management of dietary changes, as well for those areas which could 
be used most effectively for livestock and plant production. 
 
Loss of biodiversity has been highlighted in several studies as a major trade-off of the low stabilization 
scenarios (Prudhomme et al. 2020). A wide range of mitigation and adaptation responses – for example, 
preserving natural ecosystems such as peatland, coastal lands and forests, reducing the competition for 
land,  fire  management,  soil  management  and most  risk  management  options  –  have  the  potential  to 
make  positive  contributions  to  sustainable  development,  ecosystems  services  and  other  social  goals

(McElwee  et  al.  2020).  Smith  et  al.  (2019a)  also  stressed  that  agricultural  practices  (e.g.  improving 
yields,  agroforestry),  forest  conservation  (e.g.  afforestation,  reforestation),  soil  carbon  sequestration 
(e.g.  biochar  addition to soils)  and  the removal  of  carbon  dioxide  (e.g.  BECCS)  could  contribute to 
climate-change  mitigation  (Smith  et  al.  2019a).  However,  there  are  also  options  that  could  improve 
biodiversity  if  they  were  implemented  jointly  with  climate-change  mitigation  in  AFOLOU.  In  their 
study, (Leclère et al. 2020) show that increasing conservation management, restoring degraded land and 
generalized  landscape-level  conservation planning  could  be  positive  for  biodiversity.  In  general,  the 
ambitious conservation efforts and transformations of food systems are central to an effective post-2020 
biodiversity strategy.  
 
The  IPCC  Special  Report  on  Climate  Change  and  Land  (IPCC  2019)  emphasizes  the  need  for 
governance in order to avoid conflict between sustainable development and land-use management. It 
states: "Measuring progress towards goals is important in decision-making and adaptive governance to 
create common understanding and advance policy effectiveness”. The report concludes that measurable 
indicators are very useful in linking land-use policies, the NDCs and the SDGs.  
 
One  example  of  an  area  where  special  governance  efforts  have  been  called  for  is  the  protection  of 
forestry, ecosystem services and local livelihoods in a context of the large-scale deployment of high-
value crops like palm oil, short-term, high income-generating activities and sustainable development. 
Serious challenges are already being seen within these areas according to (IPBES 2019).  
 
Palm-oil is one example of a product with potentially major trade-offs between meeting the SDGs and 
climate-change mitigation in the agriculture, forest and other land uses (AFOLU) sector. Currently the 
area  under  oil  palms  is  showing  a  tremendous  increase,  mostly  in  forest  conversions  to  oil-palm 
plantations (Austin et al. 2019; Gaveau et al. 2016; Schoneveld et al. 2019). The conversion of peat 
swamp forest and mineral forest to oil palms will yield different amounts of CO2. A study by Novita et 
al. (2020) shows that the carbon stock of primary peat-swamp forest was 1,770 Mg C/ha compared to 
a carbon stock of oil palm of 759 Mg C/ha. The study conducted by Guillaume et al. shows that the 
carbon stock in mineral soils was 284 Mg C/ha compared to that in rain forest, which was 110.76 Mg 
C/ha (Guillaume et al. 2018). 
 
Restoring peatlands is one of the most promising strategies for achieving nature-based CDR (Girardin 
et al. 2021; Seddon et al. 2021). A study by Novita et al. (2021) shows that significantly different CO2 
emissions for different land-use categories are influenced more by the water table depth and latitude 
position for those locations relative to other observed parameters, such as bulk density, air temperature 
and rainfall. 
 
Given that the frequent peat-land fires in Indonesia were caused by land clearances in the replanting 
season,  multi-stakeholder  collaboration  between  oil-palm  plantations,  local  communities  and  local 
governments over practices such zero burning when clearing land might be one of the most effective 
ways  to  reduce  the  deforestation impact  of  oil  palm  (Jupesta et al.  2020).  Behavioural changes as a 
mitigation option have been suggested as a major factor in aligning sustainable development, climate 
change  and  land  management.  In  the  absence  of  the  policy  intervention,  the  expansion  of  oil-palm 
plantations has provided limited benefits to indigenous and Afro-descended communities. Even when 
oil-palm  expansion  improves rural  livelihoods,  the  benefits  are unevenly  distributed  across  the  rural 
population  (Andrianto  et  al.  2019;  Castellanos-Navarrete  et  al.  2021).  In  any  case,  while  oil-palm 
production  can  improve smallholders'  livelihoods in  certain  circumstances,  this  sector  offers  limited 
opportunities for agricultural labourers, especially woman (Castellanos-Navarrete et al. 2019).  
 
Economy-wide mitigation costs can be effectively limited by lifestyle, technology and policy choices, 
as  well  as  benefit  from  synergies  with  the  SDGs.  Synergies  come  from  the  consumption  side  by 
managing demand. For example, reducing food waste leads to resources being saved because water, 
land-use, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are all reduced (Chapter 3).

IPCC 6th AR Chapter 12 emphasized that diets high in plant protein and low in meat, in particular red 
meat, are associated with lower GHG emissions. Emerging food-chain technologies such as microbial, 
plant,  or  insect-based  protein  promise  substantial  reductions  in  direct  GHG  emissions  from  food 
production. The full mitigation potential of such technologies can only be realised in low-GHG energy 
systems. 
 
Springmann et al. (2018) conclude that reductions in food waste could be a very important option for 
reducing agricultural  GHG  emissions, the demand for  agricultural land  and  water,  and  nitrogen  and 
phosphorous  applications.  In  addition  to  the  possibility  to  reduce  food  waste,  their  study  analysed 
several  other  options  for  reducing  the  environmental  effects  of  the  food  system,  including  dietary 
changes  in  the  direction  of  healthier,  more  plant-based  diets  and  improvements  in  technologies  and 
management.  It  was  concluded  that,  relative  to  a  baseline  scenario  for  2050,  dietary  changes  in  the 
direction of healthier diets could reduce GHG emissions by 29% and 5–9% respectively in a dietary-
guideline scenario, and by 56% and 6–22% respectively in a more plant-based diet scenario. Demand-
side,  service-oriented  solutions  vary  between  and  within  countries  and  regions,  according  to  living 
conditions and context. Avoiding food waste reduces GHG emissions substantially. Dietary shifts to 
plant-based nutrition leads to healthier lives and reduce GHG emissions (Chapter 5.3).  
 
A similar study also found a positive impact form zero food waste. The ‘no food waste’ scenario could 
decrease global average food calorie availability by 120 kcal person−1 d−1 and protein availability by 
4.6 g protein person−1 d−1 relative to their baseline levels, thus reducing required crop and livestock 
production by 490 and 190 Mt respectively. This lower level of production reduces agricultural land 
use by 57 Mha and thus mitigates the associated side effects on the environment. The lower levels of 
production also reduce the requirements for fertilizers and water by 10 Mt and 110 km3 respectively, 
and GHG emissions are reduced by 410 MtCO2e yr−1 relative to the 2030 baseline. Reducing food waste 
can contribute to lessening the demand for food, feed and other resources such as water and nitrogen, 
reducing the pressure on land and the environment while ending hunger (Hasegawa et al. 2019).  
 
In 2007, Britain launched a nationwide initiative to reduce household food waste, which achieved a 21 
percent reduction within five years (FAO 2019). The basis of this initiative was the “Love Food, Hate 
Waste” radio, TV, print and online media campaign run by a non-profit organization, the Waste and 
Resources Action Programme (WRAP). The campaign raised awareness among consumers about how 
much  food  they  waste,  how  it  affects  their  household  budgets  and  what  they  can  do  about  it.  This 
initiative collaborated with food manufacturers and retailers to stimulate innovation, such as re-sealable 
packaging, shared meal-planning and food-storage tips. The total implementation costs during the five-
year  period  were estimated  at  GBP  26  million, from which it  was  households  that derived the most 
benefit, estimated to be worth GBP 6.5 billion. Local authorities also realized a substantial GBP 86 
million worth of savings in food-waste disposal costs. As for the private sector, the benefits took the 
form of increased product shelf lives and reduced product loss. While households started to consume 
more efficiently and companies may have experienced a decline in food sales, the latter also stated that 
the non-financial benefits, such as strengthened consumer relationships, had offset the costs.  
 
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group of countries has also created several types of 
public–private  partnership  to  tackle  food  waste  and  reduce  losses.  Most  of  these  partnerships  are 
focused on food-waste recycling in both developed and developing countries (Rogelj et al. 2018). APEC 
members stated that knowledge-sharing and improved policy and project management were the most 
important advantages of public–private partnerships.  
 
The  inextricably  intertwined  factors  in  decision-making  are  influenced  by  the  characteristics  of  the 
person, in interaction with the characteristics of more sustainable practices and products, which interact 
with a particular context that includes the immediate environment (e.g., household, farm), the indirect 
environment  (e.g.,  community)  and  macro-environmental  factors  (e.g.,  the  political,  financial  and 
economic  contexts)  (Hoek  et  al.  2021).  Hence,  to  influence  people  to  make  decisions  in  favour  of 
sustainable  food  production  or  consumption,  a  wider  perspective  is  needed  on  decision-making

processes and behavioural change, in which individuals are not targeted in isolation, but in interaction 
with this wider systemic environment.  
 
In conclusion, the AFOLU sector offers many low-cost mitigation options, which, however, can also 
create trade-offs between land-use for food, energy, forest and biodiversity. Some options can help to 
mitigate  such  trade-offs,  like  agricultural  practices  (e.g.,  improved  yields,  agroforestry),  forest 
conservation (e.g. afforestation, reforestation), soil carbon sequestration (e.g. biochar addition to soils) 
and the removal of carbon dioxide (e.g. BECCS), which could contribute to climate change mitigation. 
Lifestyle changes, including dietary changes and reduced food waste, are tightly embedded in modes 
of  behaviour  that  are  influenced  by  the  immediate  environment  (e.g.,  household,  farm),  the  indirect 
environment (e.g., community) and macro-environmental factors (e.g., political, financial and economic 
contexts). Achieving zero-food waste could reduce the demands for land (SDG 15), water use (SDG 6) 
and  chemical  fertilizers  (SDG  9),  leading  to  GHG  emissions  reductions  (SDG  13)  by  encouraging 
sustainable consumption and production practices (SDG 12).  
 
17.3.3.2 Water-Energy-Food-Nexus 
This  section  addresses  the  links  between  water,  energy  and  food  in  the  context  of  sustainable 
development  and  the  associated  synergies  and  trade-offs,  with  links  to  related  chapters.  The  focus 
outline includes scoping and the relationship with the SDGs, general climate-change impacts on global 
water resources, energy-system impacts and the relationship to renewables, enabling strategies, trade-
offs and cross-sectoral implications (see also Chapter 12), nexus-management tools and strategies, and 
a box with examples from India and South Africa. 
 
The  continually  increasing  pressures  on  natural  resources,  such  as  land  and  water,  due  to  the  rising 
demands from increases in population and living standards, which also require more energy, emphasises 
the need to integrate sustainable planning and exploitation (Bleischwitz et al. 2018). 

The water-energy-food nexus is at the epicentre of these challenges, which are of global relevance and 
are the focus of policies and planning at all levels and sectors of the global society. The nexus between 
water, energy and food (WEFN) (Zhang et al. 2018b) is tight and complex, and needs careful attention 
and deciphering across spatio-temporal scales, sectors and interests to balance proper management and 
trade-offs and to pursue sustainable development (Biggs et al. 2015; Dai et al. 2018;  Hamiche et al. 
2016). The WEFN touches upon the majority of the UN’s SDGs, such as 2, 6-7 and 11-15 (Bleischwitz 
et al. 2018), and deals with basic commodities, thus guaranteeing the basic livelihoods of the global 
population.  

 
The  task  of  gaining  an  improved  understanding  of  WEFN  processes  across  disciplines  such  as  the 
natural sciences, economics, the social sciences and politics has been further exacerbated by climate 
change, population growth and resource depletion. In light of the system of interlinkages involved, the 
WEFN  concept  essentially  also  covers  land  (Ringler  et  al.  2013)  and  climate  (Brouwer  et  al.  2018; 
Sušnik et al. 2018) and can be further assessed in light of the relevant economic, ecological, social and 
SDG aspects (Fan et al. 2019a). Fan et al. (2019b) specifically, SDGs 2 (food), 6 (water), (7) energy, 
11 (cities) and 12 (production and consumption) are considered essential to the WEFN (Bleischwitz et 
al. 2018). The nexus approach was introduced in the early 2010s, when it was argued that advantages 
could  be  gained  by  adopting  a  nexus  approach  with  regard  to  cross-sectoral  and  human–nature 
dependencies  and  by  taking  externalities  into  account  (Hoffmann  2011).  Hence,  within  the  nexus, 
obvious trade-offs exist with competing interests, such as water availability versus food production.  
 
Climate change is projected to impact on the distribution, magnitude and variability of global water 
resources. A yearly increase in precipitation of 7% globally is expected by 2100 in a high-emissions 
scenario (RCP 8.5), although with significant inter-model, inter-regional and inter-temporal differences 
(Giorgi  et  al.  2019).  Similarly,  extreme  events  related  to  the  water  balance,  such  as  droughts  and 
extreme  precipitation,  are  projected  to  shift  in  the  future  (RCP4.5)  towards  2100:  for  example,  the 
number of consecutive dry days is projected to increase in the Mediterranean region, southern Africa, 
Australia and the Amazon (Chen et al. 2014). In impact terms, an increase of 20-30% in global water-

use  is  expected  by  2050  due  to  the  industrial  and  domestic  demand  for  water.  Already  four  billion 
people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month per year (WWAP-UNESCO 2019).  
 
Globally,  climate  change  has  been  shown  to  cause  increases  of  4%,  8%  and  10%  in  the  share  of 
population being exposed to water scarcities under the 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C scenarios for global warming 
respectively (RCP8.5) (Koutroulis et al. 2019). At the same time, climate change is projected to cause 
a general increase in extreme events and climate variability, placing a substantial burden on society and 
the economy (Hall et al. 2014). Other than the human influence on the global hydro-climate, human 
activities have been shown to surpass even the impact of climate change in low to moderate emission 
scenarios  of  the  water  balance  (Haddeland  et  al.  2014).  Similar  conclusions  have  been  found  by 
(Destouni et al. 2013; Koutroulis et al. 2019).  
 
An obvious consequence of the impact of climate change on future hydro-climatic patterns is the fact 
that the energy system is projected to experience vast impacts through climate change  (Fricko et al. 
2016; Van Vliet et al. 2016a; van Vliet et al. 2016; Chapter 6). In the short run, where fossil-fuel sources 
make up a significant share of the global energy grid, climate impacts related to water availability and 
water temperatures will affect thermoelectric power generation, which relies mainly on water cooling 
(Larsen and Drews 2019; Pan et al. 2018); water is also used for pollution and dust control, cleaning 
etc. (Larsen et al. 2019). Currently, 98% of electricity generation relies on thermoelectric power (81%) 
and hydropower (17%) (van Vliet et al. 2016).  
 
Of  these  thermoelectric  sources,  the  vast  majority  employ  substantial  amounts  of  water  for  cooling 
purposes,  although  there  is  a  trend  currently  towards  implementing  more  hybrid  or  drier  forms  of 
cooling (Larsen et al. 2019).  
 
The renewable energy conversion technologies that are currently dominant globally and are projected 
to remain so are less vulnerable to water deficiencies than fossil-based technologies, since no cooling 
is used. These renewable energy conversion sources include, e.g., wind, solar PV and wave energy. The 
implementation of such sources will, in the longer run, have the potential to reduce water usage by the 
energy  sector  substantially  (Lohrmann  et  al.  2019).  Also,  an  increasing  share  of  renewables  within 
desalination, as well as improved irrigation efficiencies, have been shown to potentially improve the 
inter-sectorial WEFN water balance (Lohrmann et al. 2019). Also, an increasing share of renewables 
on  connection  with  desalination,  as  well  as  improved  irrigation  efficiencies,  have  been  shown  to 
potentially  improve  the  inter-sectorial  WEFN  water  balance  (Caldera  and  Breyer  2020).  Some  less 
dominant renewable-energy technologies do use water for cooling, such as geothermal energy and solar 
CSP, if wet cooling is employed. Despite the general detachment from water resources, wind and solar 
PV, for example, are highly dependent on climate-change patterns, including variability depending on 
future energy-storage capacities and on-/off-grid solutions (Schlott et al. 2018). Furthermore, regardless 
of whether or not they are based on renewables, climate change will affect energy usage across sectors, 
such as heating and cooling in the building stock. The energy systems in question need to be able to 
handle variations and extremes in demand (Larsen et al. 2020).  
 
For the 2080s compared to 1971-2000, an increase of 2.4% to 6.3% in the global gross hydropower 
potential, from the hydrological side alone, is seen across all scenarios (van Vliet et al. 2016 and Chapter 
6).  Alongside  the  global increase  in  hydropower potential, the  global  mean  water-discharge  cooling 
capacity, which also relates to water temperatures, experiences a decrease of 4.5% to 15% across  the 
scenarios. In very general and global terms, when combined, these changes support the shift towards 
sources  of  renewable  energy,  including  hydropower,  in  the  energy  mix.  When  it  comes  to  ensuring 
stability in the management of the electricity grid, hydro-climatological extremes have the potential to 
pose vast difficulties in certain regions and/or seasons depending on the nature of the energy mix (Van 
Vliet et al. 2016b). Van Vliet et al. (2016a) showed significant reductions in both thermoelectric and 
hydropower  electricity  capacities,  exemplified  by  the  2003  European  drought,  which  resulted  in 
reductions of 4.7% and 6.6% respectively.

The energy sector is vulnerable to production losses caused mainly by heatwaves and droughts, whereas 
coastal  and  fluvial  floods  are  also  responsible  for  a  large  relative  share  of  the  energy  sector’s 
vulnerability, as assessed by (Forzieri et al. 2018) for Europe in 2100. In total, heatwaves and droughts 
will be responsible for 94% of the damage costs to the European energy system compared to 40% today. 
Similarly,  (Craig  et  al.  2018)  show  that,  despite  potentially  minor  spatiotemporally  aggregated 
differences for various energy-system components, such as demand, thermoelectric power, wind etc., 
the aggregated impact of climate change across these components will cause a significant impact on the 
energy system, as currently exemplified by the USA. In  terms of investments and management, it is 
important  to  unravel  these  cross-component  relations  in  light  of  the  projected  nature  of  the  future 
climate.  

In the ongoing transition towards renewable sources of energy (see also Chapters 3, 4 and 6), the impact 
of the hydro-climate on energy production continues to be highly relevant (Jones and Warner 2016). As 
the shares of thermoelectric energy production in the energy grid go down along with the introduction 
of  thermoelectric  cooling  technologies  using  smaller  amounts  of  water,  new  energy  sources  and 
technologies are being introduced, and existing sources scaled up. Of these, hydropower, wind and solar 
energy are the key energy sources currently and will be in the near future, making up 2.5% and 1.8% 
of the total global primary energy supply in 2017 respectively (IEA 2019). Wind and solar energy are 
directly independent of water in themselves, but are dependent on atmospheric conditions related to 
processes that also drive the water balance and circulation. Hydropower, on the other hand, is directly 
influenced by and dependent on the supply of water, while at the same time being an essential counter-
component to seasonality and climatological variation, as well as to current and future demand curves 
and diurnal variations, as against wind and solar energy (De Barbosa et al. 2017). 
 
Furthermore, policy instruments in power-system management, here exemplified by hydropower in a 
climate-change scenario, have been shown to enhance energy production during droughts (Gjorgiev and 
Sansavini 2018). The significant influence of variation in the planning of renewable energy for the 21st 
century  has  also  been  highlighted  by  (Bloomfield  et  al.  2016).  At  the  same  time,  the  integration  of 
renewables  must  account  for  lower  thermoelectric  efficiencies  and  capacities  due  to  increases  in 
temperature (van Vliet et al. 2016), power-plant closures during extreme weather events due to a lack 
of cooling capacity (Forzieri et al. 2018) and further efficiency reductions and penalties following the 
implementation  of  CCS  technologies  in  the  effort  to reach  the  GHG  mitigation targets  (Byers  et  al. 
2015).  However,  more  recent  studies  find  more  promising  amounts  of  water  being  used  for  energy 
conversion (IEAGHG 2020; Magneschi et al. 2017).  
 
The  extraction,  distribution  and  wastewater  processes  of  anthropogenic  water-management  systems 
similarly  use  vast  amounts  of  energy,  making  the  proper  management  of  water  essential  to  reduce 
energy usage and GHG emissions (Nair et al. 2014 and Chapter 11). One study reports that the water 
sector accounts for 5% of total US GHG emissions (Rothausen and Conway 2011). Within the WEFN, 
there is an obvious trade-off between water availability and food production, competing demands that 
pose a risk to the supply of the basic commodities of food, energy and water in line with the SDGs 
(Bleischwitz  et  al.  2018;  Gao  et  al.  2019),  all  of  which  has  the  potential  for  inter-sectorial  or  inter-
regional conflicts (Froese and Schilling 2019). Currently, 24% of the global population live in regions 
with constant water-scarce food production, and 19% experience occasional water scarcities (Kummu 
et al. 2014). To counterbalance the demand for food and comestibles in regions that experience constant 
or intermittent supplies, transportation is needed, which in itself requires suitable infrastructure, energy 
supplies, a well-functioning trading environment and support policies. Of the 2.6 billion people who 
experience constant or occasional water scarcities in food production, 55% rely on international trade, 
21% on domestic trade and the remainder on water stocks (Kummu et al. 2014).  
 
The  relations  between  the  influence  of  hydro-climatic  variability,  socio-economic  conditions  and 
patterns of water scarcity have been addressed by (Veldkamp et al. 2015). A key finding of this study 
was the ability of the hydro-climate and the socio-economy to interact, enforcing or attenuating each 
other,  though  with  the  former  acting  as  the  key  immediate  driver,  and  the  influence  of  the  latter 
emerging after six to ten years.

The trade-offs between competing demands have been investigated on a continental scale in the US 
Great Plains, highlighting the influence of irrigation in mitigating reductions in crop yields (Zhang et 
al. 2018b). Despite crop-yield reductions of 50% in dry years compared to wet years, a key conclusion 
was that the irrigation should be counterbalanced against general water and energy savings within the 
context  of  trade-offs.  In  East  Asia,  the  WEFN  has  been  quantified,  highlighting  obvious  trade-offs 
between economic growth, environmental issues and food security (White et al. 2018). This same study 
also highlights the concept of a virtual WEFN that includes water embodied within products that are 
traded and shipped. (Liu et al. 2019) find an urgent need for proper assessment methods, including of 
trade within the WEFN, due to the significant resource allocations. 
 
Within the WEFN, the implementation of policies to achieve low stabilisation targets is strongly linked 
to  sustainable  development  within  the  water  sector  with  regard  to  water  management  and  water 
conservation,  indicating  that  additional  coherence  in  policies  affecting  the  water,  energy  and  food 
sectors (among others) will be critical in achieving the SDGs  see also Chapter 7). Subsidized fertilizers, 
energy and crops can drive unsustainable levels of water usage and pollution in agriculture. More than 
half the world’s population, roughly 4.3 billion people in 2016, live in areas where the demand for water 
resources outstrips sustainable supplies for at least part of the year. Irrigated agriculture is already using 
around 70% of the available freshwater, and the large seasonal variations in water supply and the needs 
of different crops can create conflicts between water needs across sectors at different time scales (Wada 
et al. 2016). However, as there is little potential for increasing irrigation or expanding cropland (Steffen 
et  al.  2015),  gaps  in  food  production  gaps  must  be  closed  by  increasing  productivity  and  cropping 
densities  on  currently  harvested  land  by  increasing  either  rain-fed  yields  or  water-use  efficiency 
(Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012).  
 
It  has  been  argued  that  applying  an  integrated  approach  to  water-energy-climate-food  resource 
management and policy-making is highly beneficial in properly addressing the co-benefits and trade-
offs (Brouwer et al. 2018; Howells et al. 2013), accommodating the SDGs (Rasul 2016) and in general 
assessing  enabling  strategies  to  improve  resource  efficiency  (Dai  et  al.  2018).  For  an  integrated 
approach to analysing the WEFN, a number of modelling approaches, tools and frameworks have been 
proposed (Brouwer et al. 2018; de Strasser et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2019; Larsen et al. 2019; Smajgl et al. 
2016), often involving multi-objective calibration. Such tools enable decision-makers to evaluate the 
optimal  water-allocation  and  energy-saving  solutions  for  the  specific  geography  in  question.  As  an 
example,  (Scott  2011)  found  the  higher  transportability  of  electricity,  compared  to  water,  pivotal  in 
water-energy adaptation solutions in the USA, while arguing for the additional coordination of water 
and energy policies as a key instrument in balancing the trade-offs.  
 
Common to all these integrated efforts is the challenge involved in making comparisons across studies 
due  to  the  combined  complexities  of  assumptions,  model  codes,  regions,  variables,  forcings  etc.  To 
accommodate these challenges, (Larsen et al. 2019) suggest employing shared criteria and forcing data 
to enable cross-model comparisons and uncertainty estimates, as also highlighted by (Brouwer et al. 
2018). Other limitations in current WEFN research are partial system descriptions, the failure to address 
uncertainties, system boundaries, and evaluation methods and metrics (Zhang et al. 2018b). The lack of 
proper access to WEFN data and data quality has been highlighted by (D’Odorico et al. 2018; Larsen 
et al. 2019). Furthermore, gaps have been identified between theory and end-user applications in the 
lack of any focus on food nutritional values as opposed to calories alone, in the understanding of water 
availability  in  relation  to  management  practices,  in  integrating  new  energy  technologies  and  in  the 
resulting environmental issues (D’Odorico et al. 2018).  
 
Therefore, looking ahead, future fields of WEFN research should provide greater insights into all these 
aspects. Holistic frameworks have been put forward to facilitate methods of WEFN management by 
focusing on, for example, the geographical complexities with regard to transboundary challenges within 
hydrological catchments (de Strasser et al. 2016), aligning policy incentives (Rasul 2016) and making 
synergies and trade-offs in relation to WEFN SDG targets (Fader et al. 2018) etc. The roles of all levels 
of government in optimal WEFN management are also highlighted in (Kurian 2017), especially with

regard to shaping the behaviour of individuals. Furthermore, (Kurian 2017) highlights the challenges 
involved  in  science  and  policy  communicating  with  one  another  and  in  the  provision  of  optimal 
instruments  and  guidelines.  Engaging  non-experts  and  end-users  in  scientific  processes  is  seen  as 
essential to capturing previous failures and successes and to ensure that understanding the challenges is 
updated to help shape the research questions.    
 
Coordination of water use across different sectors and deltas is an important factor in sustainable water 
management. Examples of instruments and policies that support this from India and Sub-Saharan Africa 
in relation to the groundwater crisis are given below. India is the world’s largest user of groundwater 
for  irrigation,  which  covers  more  than  half  of  the  country’s  total  irrigated  agricultural  area,  is 
responsible for 70% of food production and supports more than 50% of the population (700 million 
people) (see also Chapter 7). However, excessive extraction of groundwater is depleting aquifers across 
the  country,  and  falls  in  the  water  table  have  become  pervasive.  Improved  water-use  efficiency  in 
irrigated agriculture is being considered, both globally and in India, as a way of meeting future food 
requirements with increasingly scarce water resources (Fishman et al. 2015).  
 
The entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa has an undeveloped potential for groundwater exploitation, despite 
the general perception of a global groundwater crisis, this being due to the absence of services to support 
groundwater development (Cobbing 2020). It is estimated that most Sub-Saharan countries in Africa 
utilize less than 5% of their national sustainable yields (Cobbing and Hiller 2019). The initial tool for 
driving sustainable groundwater exploitation is a change in the narrative of a lack of resources in order 
to stimulate increased agricultural production and increased fulfilment of the SDGs  (Cobbing 2020). 
Quantitative  measures  of  actual  groundwater  vulnerability  based  on  multiple  indicators  have  been 
calculated by, for example,  (van Rooyen et al. 2020), showing that 20.4% of South Africa’s current 
water resources are highly vulnerable and are projected to worsen fifty years into the future.  
 
Despite the positive perspectives regarding Sub-Saharan groundwater resources, the 2015-2017 water 
crisis  in  South  Africa,  including  in  Cape  Town,  clearly  predicts  vulnerability  to  climate  variability 
(Carvalho  Resende  et  al.  2019),  which is  predicted  to  increase.  Serving  as inspiration  for  the  future 
mitigation of water depletion, (Olivier and Xu 2019) suggest certain governance tools to improve the 
diversification of water sources and the management of existing supplies.  
 
17.3.3.3 Industry  
Industrial  transformation  is  a  core  component  in  achieving  sustainable  development.  Across  all 
industrial sectors, the development and deployment of innovative technologies, business models and 
policy approaches at scale will be essential in accelerating progress both with meeting the economic 
and social development goals and with achieving low emissions. In this section, we assess the synergies 
and  trade-offs  between  mitigation  options  and  the  SDGs,  with  a  specific  focus  on  asking  whether 
economic growth and employment creation can work jointly with climate actions and other SDGs in 
least developed and developing countries. Examples of synergies and trade-offs are provided based on 
the  conclusions  of  Chapter  9  on  the  building  sector  and  Chapter  11  on  industry.  The  potential  for 
greening industry is discussed in relation to eco-industrial parks, with examples from Ethiopia, China, 
South Africa and Ghana.   
 
Chapter 11 concludes that achieving net zero emissions from the industrial sector are possible. This will 
require the provision of electricity free from greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions, including from other 
energy  carriers,  increased  electrification,  low  carbon  feedstocks,  and  a  combination  of  energy 
efficiency, reduced demand for materials, a more circular economy, electrification and carbon capture, 
use and storage (CCUS). 
 
The potential co-benefits of mitigation options in industry has been mapped out in Chapter 11 in relation 
to five categories of mitigation options: material efficiency and reductions in the demand for materials, 
the circular economy and industrial waste, carbon capture utilization and storage, energy efficiency, 
and electrification and fuel switching (Figure 11.15 in Chapter 11). In particular, the first two categories 
of options are assessed as having several co-benefits for the SDGs, including SDGs 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 11, 12,

and 15. Some studies also point out the potential trade-offs in respect of employment and the costs of 
cleaner  production.  The  other  options  primarily  impact  on  climate  actions,  decent  work  and 
employment, and industry as such. 
 
Okereke et al. (2019) offer important generic conclusions on green industrialisation and the transition 
based  on  a  study  of  socio-technical transition  in  Ethiopia.  The  importance of  drivers  for  changes  in 
terms of clear policy goals and government support for green growth and climate policies, as well as 
support from a strong culture of innovation, is emphasized. The study also identifies key barriers in 
relation  to  stakeholder  interactions,  the  availability  of  resources  and  the  ongoing  tensions  between 
ambitions  for  high  economic  growth  and  climate  change.  Green  innovation  in  industry  critically 
depends on regulations. Gramkow and Anger-Kraavi (2018) have assessed the role of fiscal policies in 
greening  Brazilian  industry  based  on  an  econometric  analysis  of  24  manufacturing  sectors.  They 
conclude  that  instruments  like  low-cost  finance  for  innovation  and  support  to  sustainable  practices 
effectively promote green innovation. 
 
Luken (2019) have assessed the drivers, barriers and enablers for green industry in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
concluding that major barriers exist related to material and input costs, as well as product requirements 
in  foreign  markets,  and  that  as  a  result  there  are  trade-offs  between  economic  and  environmental 
performance. Studies of ten countries are reviewed, and although they suffer from limited information, 
they  conclude  similarly  that  further  progress  is  being  hindered  by  poor  access  to  finance  and  weak 
government regulation. (Greenberg and Rogerson 2014) They similarly conclude that the greening of 
industry in South Africa is lagging behind due to economic barriers and weak governance, despite its 
high priority in government planning and among international partners.  
 
Ghana has launched a "One District One Factory” (1D1F) initiative, aimed at establishing at least one 
factory or enterprise in each of Ghana’s 216 districts as a means of creating economic growth poles to 
accelerate  the  development  of  these  areas  and  create  jobs  for  the  country’s  increasingly  youthful 
population.  The  policy  aims  to  transform  the  structure  of  the  economy  from  one  dependent  on  the 
production and export of raw materials to a value-added industrialized economy driven primarily by the 
private sector (Yaw 2018). As has been pointed out by (Mensah et al. 2021), in its initial design the 
programme did not take environmental quality into consideration. Although it was successful in creating 
economic  growth,  exports  and  employment,  the  environmental  impacts  have  been  negative.  It  has 
therefore  been  recommended  that  environmental  regulations  be  imposed  on  foreign  investments. 
Similar conclusions have been drawn by (Solarin et al. 2017).  
 
Chapter 11 concludes that eco-industrial parks, in which businesses cooperate with each other in order 
to avoid environmental pressure and support sustainable development, have delivered several benefits 
in relation to overall reductions in both virgin materials and final wastes, implying significant reductions 
in  industrial  GHG  emissions.  Due  to  these  advantages,  eco-industrial  parks  have  been  actively 
promoted, especially in East Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea, where national 
indicators and governance exist (Geng et al. 2019; Geng and Hengxin 2009).  
 
Zeng et al. (2020) have assessed the role of eco-industrial parks in China's green transformation for 33 
development  zones  in  relation  to  contributions  to  GDP,  industrial  value  added,  exports,  water  and 
energy  consumption,  CO2  levels  and  sulphur  emissions.  They  concluded  that  industrial  parks  have 
played  a  very  important  role  in  China’s  industrialisation,  and  that  this  structure  has  supported  the 
decoupling of economic growth and energy and water consumption from the environmental impacts. 
However,  improved  environmental  performance  would  require  better access  to  finance and a  higher 
priority by management.  
 
Eco-industrial  parks  have  been  promoted  in  Ethiopia  by  the  government  and  UNIDO,  based  on  the 
expectation that they could help to boost the economy (UNIDO 2018, Oqubay et al 2021). One of the 
success stories is an industrial park in Hawassa, a nation-level textile and garment industrial park with 
a  "zero  emissions  commitment"  based  on  renewable  energy  and  energy-efficient  technologies. 
However, the concept of the industrial park, including feasible policies and institutional arrangements,

is new to Ethiopia’s regulatory processes, and this has created problems for management, knowledge 
and governance, hindering their fast implementation. 
 
A number of business associations have developed strategies for sustainable development and climate 
change,  including  cooperate  social  responsibility  (CSR).  International  initiatives  have  included  the 
promotion  of  CSR  initiatives  by  international  investors  in  low-income  countries  to  support  a  broad 
range  of  development  priorities,  including  social  working  conditions,  eliminating  child  labour  and 
climate change (Lamb et al. 2017). Leventon et al. (2015) evaluated the role of mining industries in 
Zambia in supporting climate-compatible development and concluded that, although the industry has 
played  a  positive  role  in  avoiding  migration  and  pressure  on  forest  resources,  there  is  a  lack  of 
coordination between government and industry initiatives. 
 
It can be concluded that most of the mitigation options in industry considered in this section could have 
synergies with the SDGs, but also that some of the renewable-energy options could indicate some trade-
offs in relation to land use, with implications for food- and water security and costs. Carbon capture 
and storage could play an enabling role in the provision of reliable, sustainable and modern energy and 
could  support  decarbonisation,  but  it  can  also  be  costly  (IEAGHG  2020; Mikunda  et  al. 2021).  The 
provision  of  water  for  CCS  can  include  both  synergies  and  trade-offs  with  the  SDGs  due  to  recent 
progress  in  water-management  technologies  (Giannaris  et  al.  2020;  IEAGHG  2020;  Mikunda  et  al. 
2021) 
 
17.3.3.4 Cities, Infrastructure and Transportation 
With 80% of the global population expected to be urban by 2050, cities will shape development paths 
for the foreseeable future (United Nation 2018). The challenge for many policymakers is to construct 
development paths that make cities clean, prosperous and liveable while mitigating climate change and 
building resilience to heatwaves, flooding and other climate risks. The IPCC 1.5 report sees achieving 
these  objectives  as  feasible:  cities  could  potentially  realize  significant  climate  and  sustainable-
development benefits from shifting development paths (Wiktorowicz et al. 2018). The section assesses 
the  synergies  and  trade-offs  between  meeting  the  SDGs  and  climate-change  mitigation,  as  well  as 
providing  a  general  overview  of  mitigation  options  in  cities  and  of  enabling  factors,  including  city 
networks and plans for jointly addressing the SDGs and climate-change mitigation.  
 
Chapter 8 concludes that urban areas potentially offer several joint benefits between mitigation and the 
SDGs,  and  that  since  AR5,  evidence  of  the  co-benefits  of  urban  mitigation  continues  to  grow.  In 
developing  countries,  a  co-benefits  approach  that  frames  climate  objectives  alongside  other 
development  benefits  arise  increasingly  being  seen  as  an  important  concept  justifying  and  driving 
climate-change actions in developing countries (Sethi and Puppum De Oliveria 2018; Seto et al. 2016).  
 
Evidence of the co-benefits of urban mitigation measures on human health has increased significantly 
since  the  IPCC  AR5,  especially through the  use of  health-impact  assessments in  cities  like  Geneva, 
where  energy  savings  and  cleaner  energy-supply  structures  based  on  measures  for  urban  planning, 
heating and transport have reduced CO2, NOx and PM10 emissions and increased the opportunities for 
physical activity for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (Diallo et al. 2016).  

There is increasing evidence that climate-mitigation measures can lower health risks that are related to 
energy  poverty,  especially in  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  the  elderly  (Monforti-Ferrario  et  al.  2019). 
Moreover,  the  use  of  urban  forestry  and  green  infrastructure  as  both  a  climate  mitigation  and  an 
adaptation measure can reduce heat stress (Kim and Coseo 2019; Privitera and La Rosa 2017) while 
removing air pollutants to improve air quality (Scholz et al. 2018; De la Sota et al. 2019) and enhancing 
well-being, including contributions to local development and possible reductions of inequalities (Lwasa 
et al. 2015). Other studies evidence the potential to reduce premature mortality by up to 7,000 in 53 
towns and cities and to create 93,000 net new jobs and lower global climate costs, as well as  reduce 
personal energy costs based on road maps for renewable energy transformations (Jacobson et al. 2018).

The co-benefits of energy-saving measures described by 146 signatories to a city climate network due 
to improved air quality have been quantified as 6,596 avoided premature deaths (with a 95% confidence 
interval  of  4,356 to  8,572  avoided  premature  deaths)  and  68,476 years  of  life  saved  (with  a  95% 
confidence interval of 45,403 and 89,358 years of life saved) (Monforti-Ferrario et al. 2019). Better air 
quality further reinforces the health co-benefits of climate-mitigation measures based on walking and 
bicycling, since the evidence suggests that increased physical activity in urban outdoor settings with 
low  levels  of  black  carbon  improves  lung  function  (Laeremans  et  al.  2018).  Chapter  9  shows  that 
mitigation actions in buildings have multiple co-benefits resulting in substantial social and economic 
value  beyond  their  direct  impacts  on  reducing  energy  consumption  and  GHG  emissions,  thus 
contributing to the achievement of almost all the United Nation’s SDGs. Most studies agree that the 
value of these multiple benefits is greater than the value of the energy savings, while their quantification 
and inclusion in decision-making processes will strengthen the adoption of ambitious reduction targets 
and improve coordination across policy areas.  
 
There  are  several  examples  of  cities  that  have  developed  plans  for  meeting  both  the  SDGs  and 
mitigation, which demonstrates the feasibility of meeting these objectives jointly. Quito, Ecuador, a city 
with  large  carbon  footprints  (Global  Opportunity  Explorer  2019)  and  climate  vulnerabilities,  has 
adopted  low-carbon  plans  that  aim  to  achieve  the  climate  goals  while  introducing  net  zero  energy 
buildings  and  reducing  water  stress  (Ordoñez  et  al.  2019;  Marcotullio  et  al.  2018).  Several  cities  in 
China,  Indonesia and  Japan  have  invested in green  city initiatives  by means  of green  infrastructural 
investments,  which  is  claimed  to  be  a  form  of  smart  investment.  Through  this  type  of  investment, 
economic growth and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions can be achieved in cities (Jupesta et 
al.  2016).  Multi-level  governance  arrangements,  public-private  cooperation  and  robust  urban-data 
platforms are among the factors enabling the pursuit of these objectives within countries (Corfee-Morlot 
et al. 2009; Gordon 2015; Creutzig et al. 2019; Yarime 2017).  
 
In  addition  to  the  mostly  domestic  enablers  listed  previously,  some  cities  have  also  benefited  from 
working  with  international  networks.  The  Global  Covenant  of  Mayors  for  Climate  and  Energy 
(Covenant of Mayors 2019), the World Mayors Council on Climate Change, ECLEI, C40, and UNDRR   
(ECLEI  2019;  C40  Cities  2019;  UN-  UNDRR  2019)  have  provided  targeted  support,  disseminated 
information and tools, and sponsored campaigns (Race to Zero) to motivate cities to embrace climate 
and sustainability objectives. Despite this support, it should be stressed that most cities are in the early 
stages  of  climate  planning  (Climate-Adapt  2019;  Eisenack  and  Reckien  2013;  Reckien  et  al.  2018). 
Furthermore, in some cases city policymakers may fail to highlight the synergies and trade-offs between 
climate and sustainable development or rebrand GHG-intensive practices as ‘sustainable’ in relevant 
plans (Tozer 2018).  

With  regard  to  city  networks,  Chapter  8,  Section  8.5  concluded  that  the  importance  of  urban-scale 
policies for sustainability has increasingly been recognized by international organizations and national 
and  regional  governments.  For  example,  in  2015,  more  than  150  national  leaders  adopted  the  UN’s 
2030  Sustainable  Development  Agenda,  including  stand-alone  SDG  11,  “make  cities  and  human 
settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” (United Nations 2015 p. 14). The following year, 
170 countries agreed to the UN New Urban Agenda (NUA), a central part of which is recognizing the 
importance  of  national  urban  policies  (NUPs)  as  a  key  to  achieving  national  economic,  social  and 
environmental goals (United Nations 2015a, 2017). Similarly, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction  identifies  the  need  to  focus  on  unplanned  and  rapid  urbanization  to  reduce  exposure  and 
vulnerability to the risks of disasters (United Nations 2015b).  
 
For many cities, a key to reorienting development paths will be investing in sustainable, low-carbon 
infrastructure.  Because  infrastructure  has  a  long  lifetime  and  influences  everything  from  lifestyle 
choices  to  consumption  patterns,  decisions  over  an  estimated  USD90  trillion  of  infrastructure 
investment (from now to 2030) will be critical in order to avoid becoming locked into unsustainable 
paths (WRI 2016). This is particularly true in developing countries, where demands for new buildings, 
roads,  energy  and  waste-management  systems  are  already  surging.  To  some  extent,  policies  that 
accelerate  building  renovation  rates,  including  voluntary  programmes  (Van  der  Heijden  2018),  can

support  transitions  down  more  sustainable  paths  (Kuramochi  et  al.  2018).  Factoring  climate  and 
sustainable  development  considerations  into  policy  tools  that  facilitate  quantitative  emission 
performance standard (EPS) and the inclusion of climate and sustainable development benefits and risks 
in infrastructure assessments or risk-adjusted returns on investments in development banks could also 
prove useful (Rydge et al. 2015). Strong policy signals from the UNFCCC and from national climate 
policies and strategies (including NDCs) could facilitate uptake of the relevant policies and the use of 
these tools. 
 
Infrastructural investments will also have wide-ranging implications for sustainable, low-carbon urban 
development,  namely  transport  and  mobility.  To  some  extent,  decision-making  frameworks  such  as 
Avoid-Shift-Improve  could  help  make  these  patterns  low  carbon  and  sustainable  (Dalkmann  and 
Brannigan 2007; Wittneben et al. 2009). Mixed land-use planning and compact cities can not only help 
avoid  emissions  or  shift  travellers  into  cleaner  modes  (Cervero  2009),  ),  they  can  also  improve  air 
quality,  reduce  commuting  times,  enhance  energy  security  and  improve  connectivity  (Pathak  and 
Shukla 2016; Zusman et al. 2011) 
 
17.3.3.5 Mitigation-adaptation relations 
The  section  will  consider  the  links  between  mitigation  and  adaptation  options  in  the  context  of 
sustainable development and the associated synergies and trade-offs. Cross-cutting conclusions will be 
drawn based on Chapter 3 and the sectoral chapters of AR6 WGIII and Chapter 18 of AR6 WGII. The 
focus will be on the following sectors: agriculture, food and land use; water-energy-food; industry and 
the circular economy; and urban areas. 
 
IPCC,  WG  II,  concludes  that  coherent  and  integrated  policy-planning  is  needed  in  order  to  support 
integrated climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and that this is a key component of climate-
resilient  development  pathways.  Section  4.5.2  in  Chapter  4  assesses  development  pathways  and  the 
specific links between mitigation and adaptation, concluding that there can be co-benefits, and trade-
offs,  where  mitigation  implies  maladaptation.  However,  adaptation  can  also  be  a  prerequisite  for 
mitigation. It is therefore concluded that making development pathways more sustainable can build the 
capacity for both mitigation and adaptation.  
 
Climate actions, including climate-change mitigation and adaptation, are highly scale-dependent, and 
solutions  are  very  context-specific.  Especially  in  developing  countries,  a  strong  link  exists  between 
sustainable development, vulnerability and climate risks, as limited economic, social and institutional 
resources  often  result  in  low  adaptive capacities  and high  vulnerability.  Similarly,  the limitations in 
resources also constitute key elements weakening the capacity for climate-change mitigation (Jakob et 
al. 2014). The change to climate-resilient societies requires transformational or systemic changes, which 
also have important implications for the suite of available sustainable-development pathways (Kates et 
al.  2012;  Lemos  et  al.  2013).  Thornton  and  Comberti  (2017)  point  to  the  need  for  social-ecological 
transformations to take place if synergies between mitigation and adaptation are to be captured, based 
on the argument that incremental adaptation will not be sufficient when climate-change impacts can be 
extreme or rapid and when deep decarbonization simultaneously involves social change (Chapter 18 in 
AR6 WG II).  
 
As discussed in AR6 WG II, Section 18.4 in Chapter 18, there are synergies and trade-offs between 
adaptation and sustainable development, as well as between mitigation and sustainable development, 
which is supported by comprehensive assessments such as that by (Dovie 2019; Sharifi 2020). Links 
between mitigation and adaptation options are identified in Chapter 18 in AR6 WG II, such as expected 
changes  in  energy  demand  due  to  climate  change  interacting  with  energy-system  development  and 
mitigation options, changes to agricultural production practices to manage the risks of potential changes 
in  weather patterns  affecting  land-based  emissions  and  mitigation strategies,  or  mitigation  strategies 
that place additional demands on resources and markets. This increases the pressures on and costs of 
adaptation  or  ecosystem  restoration  linked  to  carbon  sequestration  and  the  benefits  in  terms  of  the 
resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, but it also could restrict mitigation options and increase 
costs. Chapter 3 of AR6 WG III similarly concludes that the connectedness and coherence of actions to

mitigate  climate  change  could  support  the  conservation  and  adaptation  of  ecosystems  and  meet  the 
sustainable development goals more widely.  
 
Options to reduce agricultural demand (e.g., dietary change, reducing food waste) can have co-benefits 
for adaptation through reductions in the demand for land and water (Smith et al. 2019b). For example, 
Grubler et al. (2018) show that stringent climate-mitigation pathways without reliance on BECCS can 
be achieved through efficiency improvements and reduced energy service and consumptions levels  in 
high-income countries.  
 
Agriculture,  food  and  land-use  is  the  sector  where  most  climate  policy  options  can  simultaneously 
generate impacts on mitigation, adaptation and the SDGs (Locatelli et al. 2015; Kongsager et al. 2016). 
Bryan et al. (2013) identified a range of synergies and trade-offs across adaptation, mitigation and the 
SDGs in Kenya, given the diversity of its climatic and ecological conditions. Improved management of 
soil fertility and improved livestock-feeding practices could provide benefits to both climate-change 
mitigation  and  adaptation,  as  well  as  increase  income  generation  from  farming.  However,  other 
improvements to agricultural management in Kenya, for example, soil water conservation, could only 
provide benefits across all three domains in some specific sub-regions.  
 
Conservation agriculture can yield mitigation co-benefits through improved fertiliser use or the efficient 
use of machinery and fossil fuels (Cui et al. 2019; Harvey et al. 2014; Pradhan et al. 2018). Climate-
smart agriculture (CSA) ties mitigation to adaptation through its three pillars of increased productivity, 
mitigation and adaptation (Lipper et al. 2014), although managing trade-offs among the three pillars 
requires care (Kongsager et al. 2016; Thornton and Comberti 2017; Soussana et al. 2019). Sustainable 
intensification also complements CSA (Campbell et al. 2014). Enhanced sustainable adaption can lead 
to effective emission-reduction benefits, such as climate-smart agricultural technologies (Nefzaoui et 
al. 2012;  Poudel  2014) and  ecosystem-based  adaptation.  Berry,  P  et al.  (2015); Geneletti and  Zardo 
(2016); and Warmenbol and Smith (2018) have shown how increases in livelihoods can contribute to 
climate change mitigation in Europe.  
  
Agroforestry can sustain or increase food production in some systems and increase farmers’ resilience 
to climate change (Jones et al. 2013). Some sustainable agricultural practices have trade-offs, and their 
implementation  can  have  negative  effects  on  adaptation  or  other  ecosystem  services.  Agricultural 
practices can aid both mitigation and adaptation on the ground, but yields may be lower, so there may 
be a trade-off between resilience to climate change and efficiency. Interconnections within the global 
agricultural  system  may  also  lead  to  deforestation  elsewhere  (Erb  et  al.  2016).  Implementation  of 
sustainable  agriculture  can  increase  or  decrease  yields,  depending  on  context  (Pretty  et  al.  2006) 
(Chapter 4).  
 
Land-based  mitigation  and  adaptation  will  not  only  help  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the 
AFOLU sector, but also help augment the sector’s role as a carbon sink by increasing forest and tree 
cover through afforestation and agroforestry activities and other eco-system-based approaches. Some 
of these options, however, can also have negative impacts on GHG emissions in the form of indirect 
impacts  on  land  use  (for  a  more  detailed  discussion,  see  Chapter  7).  If  managed  and  regulated 
appropriately, the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector could play a key role in 
mitigation  and  be  a  key  sector  for  emissions  reductions  beyond  2025  instead  of  contributing 
substantially to emissions reductions beyond 2025 ( Keramidas et al. 2018). However, the large-scale 
deployment of intensive bioenergy plantations, including monocultures, replacing natural forests and 
subsistence farmlands are likely to have negative impacts on biodiversity and can threaten food and 
water security, as well as local livelihoods, partly by intensifying social conflicts, partly by reducing 
resilience (Díaz et al. 2019). Expansion on to abandoned or unused croplands and pastures nonetheless 
present significant global potential, and will avoid the sustainability risks of expanding agriculture into 
natural vegetation (Næss et al. 2021).  
 
Based on a literature review,  Berry et al.  (2015) identified water-saving and irrigation techniques in 
agriculture as attractive adaptation options  that have positive synergies with mitigation in increasing

soil  carbon,  reducing  energy  consumption  and  reducing  CH4 emissions  from intermittent  rice-paddy 
irrigation. These measures could, however, reduce water flows in rivers and adversely affect wetlands 
and biodiversity. The study also concluded that afforestation could reduce peak water flows and increase 
carbon sequestration, but trade-offs could emerge in relation to the increased demand for water.  
 
Fast-growing tree monocultures or biofuel crops may enhance carbon stocks but reduce downstream 
water availability and the availability of agricultural land (Harvey et al. 2014). Similarly, in some dry 
environments,  agroforestry  can  increase  competition  with  crops  and  pastureland,  decreasing 
productivity and reducing the yields of catchment water (Schrobback et al. 2011; Chapter 7).  
 
Hydro-power dams are among the low-cost mitigation options, provided the cost of constructing the 
plant  is  taken  into  account,  but  they  could  have  serious  trade-offs  in  relation  to  key  sustainable-
development aspects, since in respect of water and land availability dams can have negative effects on 
ecosystems and livelihoods, thereby implying increased vulnerabilities. Section 17.3.3.2 on the water-
energy-food nexus includes examples of trade-offs between the benefits of producing electricity from 
hydro-power  dams  and  the  trade-offs  with  ecosystem  services  and  using  land  for  agriculture  and 
livelihoods. 
 
There are several potentially strong links between climate-change adaptation in industry and climate-
change mitigation. Various supply chains can be affected by climate change, energy supply and water 
supply,  and  other  resources  can  be  disrupted  by  climate  events.  Adaptation  measures  can  influence 
GHG emissions in their turn and thus mitigation because of the demand for basic materials, for example, 
as well as by influencing outdoor environments and labour productivity (Chapter 11.1.4). 

Implementing  adaptation  options  in  industry  can  also  imply  increasing  the  demand  for  packaging 
materials such as plastics and for access to refrigeration. These are among the adaptation options that 
are  dependent  on  temperature  and  storage  possibilities,  as  well  as  being  major  sources  of  GHG 
emissions. 

An  increasing  number  of  cities  are  becoming  involved  in  voluntary  actions  and  networks  aimed  at 
drawing up integrated plans for sustainable development and climate-change mitigation and adaptation, 
including  cities  in  both  high-  and  low-income  countries  around  the  world.  Grafakos  et  al.  (2019); 
Sanchez Rodriguez et al. (2018) concluded that cities are an obvious place for the development of plans 
that  can  capture  several  synergies  between  sustainable  development  and  climate-resilient  pathways. 
Kim and Grafakos (2019); and Landauer et al. (2019) similarly concluded that cities are an obvious 
platform for the development of integrated planning efforts because of the scale of policies and actions, 
which could potentially match the different policy domains. Kim and Grafakos (2019) assessed the level 
of  integration  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  in  urban  climate-change  plans  across  44  major  Latin 
American cities, concluding that the integration of climate-change mitigation and adaption plans was 
very weak in about half the cities and that limited donor finance was a main barrier. The authors also 
mention  barriers  in  relation  to  governance  and  the  weakness  or  lack  of  legal  frameworks.  The 
integration  of  SDGs  with  adaptation could  help  increase the  willingness  of  politicians to implement 
climate actions, as well as provide stronger arguments for investing the required resources  (Sanchez 
Rodriguez et al. 2018).  

The local integration of planning and policy implementation practices was also examined by Newell et 
al. (2018) in a study of eleven Canadian communities. It was concluded that, in order to put plans into 
practice,  a  deeper  understanding  needs  to  be  established  of  the  potential  synergies  and  trade-offs 
between sustainable development and climate-change mitigation and adaptation. A model was applied 
to the evaluation of key impacts, including energy innovation, transportation, the greening of cities and 
city life. The impact assessment came to the conclusion that multiple  benefits, costs and conflicting 
areas could be involved, and that bringing a broad range of stakeholders into policy implementation 
was therefore to be recommended.     
 
There are several links between mitigation and adaptation options in the building sector, as pointed out 
in Chapter 9. Adaptation can increase energy consumption and associated GHG emissions (Kalvelage

et al. 2013; Campagnolo and Davide 2019), for example, in relation to the demand for energy to meet 
indoor thermal comfort requirements in a future warmer climate (de Wilde and Coley 2012; Li and Yao 
2012; Clarke et al. 2018). Mitigation alternatives using passive approaches may increase resilience to 
the impacts of climate change on thermal comfort and could reduce cooling needs  (Wan et al. 2012; 
Andrić et al. 2019). However, climate change may reduce their effectiveness (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014).  
 
Mitigation and the co-benefits of adaptation in urban areas in relation to air quality, health, green jobs 
and equality issues are dealt with in Section 8.2 in Chapter 8, where it is concluded that most mitigation 
options will have positive impacts on adaptation, with the exception of compact cities, with trade-offs 
between mitigation and adaptation. This is because decreasing urban sprawl can increase the risks of 
flooding and heat stress. Detailed mapping between mitigation and adaptation in urban areas shows that 
there are many, very close interactions between the two policy domains and that coordinated governance 
across sectors is therefore called for. 
 
Rebuilding  and  refurbishment  after  climate  hazards  can  increase  energy  consumption  and  GHG 
emissions in the construction and building materials sectors, as it could making the existing building 
stock more climate-resilient (Hallegatte 2009; de Wilde and Coley 2012; Pyke et al. 2012) and thus also 
support implementation of the Sendai framework on disaster risk reduction  (United Nations 2015b). 
Climate change in the form of extremely high temperatures, intense rainfall leading to flooding, more 
intense winds and/or storms and sea level rises (SLRs) can seriously impact transport infrastructure, 
including  the  operations  and  mobility  of  road,  rail,  shipping  and  aviation;  Chapter  10  assesses  the 
impacts on subsectors within transportation. At the same time, these sectors are major targets for GHG 
mitigation  options,  and  many  countries  are  currently  examining  what  to  do  in  terms  of  combined 
mitigation-adaptation efforts, using the need to mitigate climate change through transport-related GHG 
emissions reductions and pollutants as the basis for adaptation action (Thornbush et al. 2013; Wang and 
Chen 2019). For example, urban sprawl indirectly affects climate processes, increasing emissions and 
vulnerability, which worsens the ability to adapt (Congedo and Munafò 2014). Hence greater use of rail 
by passengers and freight will reduce the pressures on the roads, while having less urban sprawl will 
reduce the impacts on new infrastructure, often in more vulnerable areas (IPCC 2019; Newman et al. 
2017).  
 
Despite  many  links  between  mitigation  and  adaptation  options,  including  synergies  and  trade-offs, 
Chapter 13 concludes that there are few frameworks for integrated policy implementation. One review 
of climate legislation in Europe found a lack of coordination between mitigation and adaptation, their 
implementation varying according to different national circumstances (Nachmany et al. 2015).  
 
In developing and least developed countries, there are many examples of climate policies in the NDCs 
that have been drawn up in the context of sustainable development and that cover both mitigation and 
adaptation (Chapter 13; Beg 2002; and Duguma et al. 2014). However, there are many barriers to joint 
policy implementation. Despite the emphasis on both mitigation and adaptation policies, there is very 
limited literature on how to design and implement integrated policies (Di Gregorio et al. 2017; Shaw et 
al. 2014). For example, the links within the water, energy and food nexus require coordination among 
sectoral institutions and capacity-building in innovative frameworks linking science, practice and policy 
at multiple levels (Cook and Chu 2018; Nakano 2017; Shaw et al. 2014).  
 
Another challenge is the shortage of financial, technical and human resources for implementing joint 
adaptation and mitigation policies  (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018b; Chu 2018; David and Venkatachalam 
2019;  Kedia  2016;  Satterthwaite  2017).  Several  studies  have  stressed  that  the  lack  of  finance  for 
integrating policy implementation between sustainable development and climate-change mitigation and 
adaptation  may  constitute  barriers  to  the  implementation  of  adaptation  projects  to  protect  least-
developed countries with many vulnerabilities.  
 
Locatelli  et  al.  (2016)  come  to  similar  conclusions  regarding  finance  based  on  interviews  with 
multilateral development banks, green funds and government organizations in respect of the agricultural 
and forestry sectors. International climate finance has been totally dominated by mitigation projects.

Those who were interviewed were asked about their willingness to change this balance and to commit 
more resources to projects that address both climate-change mitigation and adaptation. More than two-
thirds of those interviewed, however, raised concerns that integrated projects could be too complicated 
and that a greater alignment of financial models across different policy domains could entail greater 
financial  risks.  Another  barrier  mentioned  in  respect  of  finance  was  that  mitigation  projects  were 
primarily aimed at GHG emissions reductions, while adaptation projects had more national benefits and 
were  also  more  suitable  for  community  development  and  promoting  equality  and  fairness.  In  an 
assessment of 201 projects in the forestry and agricultural sectors in the tropics Kongsager et al. (2016), 
found that a majority of the projects contributed to both adaptation and mitigation or at least had the 
potential to do so, despite the separation between these two objectives by international and national 
institutions. 
 
17.3.3.6 Cross-sectoral digitalization  
In  this  section,  the  potential  role  of  digitalization  as  a  facilitator  of  a  fast  transition  to  sustainable 
development and low emission pathways is assessed based on sectoral examples. The contributions of 
digital technology could contribute to efficiency improvements, cross-sectoral coordination, including 
new IT services, and decreasing resource use, implying several synergies with the SDGs, as well as 
trade-offs,  for  example,  in  relation  to  reduced  employment,  increasing  energy  demand  and  the 
increasing demand for services, possibly increasing GHG emissions.  
 
The  COVID-19  pandemic  caused  radical  temporary  breaks  with  past  energy  use  trends.  How  post-
pandemic recovery will impact on the longer-term energy transition is unclear. Recovering from the 
pandemic with energy-efficient practices embedded in new patterns of travel, work, consumption and 
production reduces climate mitigation challenges (Kikstra et al. 2021). The potential of digital contact-
tracing to slow the spread of a virus had been quietly explored for over a decade before the COVID-19 
pandemic thrust the technology into the spotlight (Cebrian 2021). The COVID-19 crisis is among the 
most disruptive events in recent decades and has had consequences for consumer behaviour. During the 
lockdowns in most countries, consumers have turned to online shopping for food products, personal 
hygiene and disinfection (Cruz-Cárdenas et al. 2021), making society more digitally literate. 
 
The cost of new services provided by digitalization can be high, and this could imply barriers for low-
income  countries  in  joining  new  global  information  sharing  systems  and  markets.  Altogether  this 
implies that any assessment of the contribution of digitalization to support the SDGs and low-carbon 
pathways  will  only  be  able  to  provide  very  context-specific  results.  Digital  technologies  could 
potentially  disrupt  production  processes  in  nearly  every  sector  of  the  economy.  However,  as  an 
emerging  area  experiencing  the  rapid  penetration  of  many  sectors,  there  could  be  a  window  of 
opportunity  for  integrating  sustainable  development  and  low  emission  pathways.  IIASA  (2020) 
concludes that the digital revolution is characterised by many innovative technologies, which can create 
both synergies and trade-offs with the SDGs (IIASA 2020).

which can create both synergies and trade-offs with the SDG's (IIASA 2020).  
 
WBSD  (2019)  has  assessed  the  potential  of  communication  technologies  (ICT)  to  contribute  to  the 
transition to a global low-carbon economy in the energy, transportation, building, industry, and other 
sectors.  The  potential  is  estimated  to  be  around  15%  CO2-equivalent  emissions  reductions  in  2020 
compared with a business as usual scenario. A range of ICT solutions have been highlighted, including 
smart  motors  and  industrial  process-management  in  industry,  traffic-flow  management,  efficient 
engines for transport, smart logistics and smart energy systems.

The  TWI2050  2019  report  (IIASA  2019)  assessed  both  the  positive  and  negative  impacts  of 
digitalization in the context of sustainable development. It found that efficiency improvements, reduced 
resource-consumption  and  new  services  can  support  the  SDGs,  but  also  that  there  were  challenges, 
including in relation to equality, facing the least developed and developing countries because of their 
low level of access to technologies. The necessary preconditions for successful digital transformation 
include  prosperity,  social  inclusion,  environmental  sustainability,  protection  of  jobs  and  good 
governance  of  sustainability  transitions.  One  negative  impact  of  digitalisation  could  be  the  rebound 
effects,  where  easier  access  to  services  could  increase  demand  and  with  it  GHG  emissions. 
Digitalization in the manufacturing sector could also provide a comparative advantage to developed 
countries  due  to  the  falling  importance  of  labour  costs,  while  the  barriers  to  emerging  economies 
seeking to enter global markets could accordingly be increased. 
 
In  respect  of  governance,  Krishnan  et  al.  (2020)  point  out  that  the  creation  of  synergies  between 
sustainable development and low-emission urbanization based on digitalization could face barriers in 
the form of inadequate knowledge of structures and value creation through ecosystems that would need 
to  be  addressed  by  means  of  smart  digitalizing,  requiring  organizational  measures  to  support 
transformation processes. 
 
Urban areas are one of the main arenas for new digital solutions due to rapid urbanization rates and high 
concentrations of settlements, businesses and supply systems, which offer great potential for large-scale 
digital systems.  The emergence  of  smart cities has  supported the  uptake  of  smart integrated  energy, 
transportation, water and waste-management systems, while synergies have been created in terms of 
more flexible and efficient systems. In its 2018 Policy and Action document, the Japanese Business 
Federation (Keidanren) launched Society 5.0, which include plans for smart city development (Carraz 
and  Yuko  2019;  Narvaez Rojas  et  al.  2021).  To achieve smart cities,  Society  5.0  aimed to  facilitate 
diverse  lifestyles  and  business  success,  while  the  quality  of  life  offered  by  these  options  will  be 
enhanced. It also aims to offer high-standard medical and educational services. Autonomous vehicles 
will be available and integrated with smart grid systems in order to facilitate mobility and flexibility in 
energy  supply  with  a  high  share  of  renewable  energy.  The  energy  system  will  include  microgrids, 
renewable with demand-side controls aligned with local conditions. 
 
Chapter 6 of this report on “Energy Systems” points out that there are many smart energy options with 
the  potential  to  support  sustainable  development  by  facilitating  the  integration  of  high  shares  of 
fluctuating renewable energy in electricity systems, potentially storing energy in EV batteries or fuel 
cells, and applying load shifting by varying prices over time. It is concluded that very large efficiency 
gains are expected to emerge from digitalization in the energy sector (Figure 6.18 in Chapter 6). 
 
Section  9.9.2  in  Chapter  9  concludes  that  the  improved  energy  efficiency  and  falling  costs  in  the 
building sector that could result from digitalization could have rebound effects in increasing both energy 
consumption  and  comfort  levels.  Increasing  GHG  emissions  could  be  the  result,  but  if  low-income 
consumers  are  given  faster  access  to  affordable  energy,  this  could  agree  with  the  SDGs,  making  it 
desirable to integrate policies targeting mitigation. 
 
Section  10.1.2  in  Chapter  10  discusses  how  the  sharing  economy,  which,  for  example,  could  be 
facilitated by ICT platforms, could influence both mitigation and the SDGs. On the one hand, sharing 
has  the  potential  to  save  transport  emissions,  especially  if  EVs  are  supplied  with  decarbonised  grid 
electricity. However, an increase in transport emissions could result from this if increasing demand and 
higher comfort levels are facilitated, for example, by making access to EVs relatively easy compared 
with mass transit. Another possible trade-off is that the supply of public transport services would be 
limited to the elderly and other user groups.  
 
Green  innovation  in  agriculture  is  another  emerging  area  in  which  digitalization  is  making  huge 
progress. From the perspective of water provision, weather data can be used to predict rain amounts so 
that farmers can better manage the application of farm chemicals to minimize polluting aquifers and 
surface water systems used for drinking water. Meanwhile, smart meters, onsite and remote sensors and

satellite  data  connected  to  mobile  devices  allow  real-time  monitoring  of  crop-water  and  optimal 
irrigation  requirements.  On  the  supply  side,  remote  tele-control  systems  and  efficient  irrigation 
technologies enable farmers to control and optimize the quantity and timing of water applications, while 
minimizing  the  energy-consumption  trade-offs  of  pressurized  irrigation  in  both  rural  and  urban 
agricultural contexts (Germer et al. 2011; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2009).  
 
Technology-driven  precision  agriculture,  which  combines  geomorphology,  satellite  imagery,  global 
positioning  and  smart  sensors,  enables  enormous  increases  in  efficiency  and  productivity.  Taken 
together, these technologies provide farmers with a decision-support system in real time for the whole 
farm. Arguably, the world could feed the projected rise in population without radical changes to current 
agricultural practices if food waste can be minimized or eliminated. Digital technologies will contribute 
to minimizing these losses through increased efficiencies in supply chains, better shipping and transit 
systems, and improved refrigeration.  
 
In  conclusion,  in  most  cases  digitalization  options  may  have  both  positive  synergistic  impacts  on 
mitigation and the SDGs and some negative trade-offs. Energy-sector options are assessed primarily as 
having synergies, while some digitalisation options in transport could increase the demand for emission-
intensive modes of transport. Digital platforms for the sharing economy could have both positive and 
negative impacts depending on the goods and services that are actually exchanged (see Cross Chapter 
Box 6 in Chapter 7). Options related to agriculture and the energy-water-food nexus could help manage 
resources more efficiently across sectors, which could create synergies. Digitalization can also raise a 
number of ethical challenges according to (Clark et al. 2019). Wider public discussion of internet-based 
activities was accordingly recommended, including topics such as the negotiation of online consent and 
the use of data for which consent has not been obtained. 
 
17.3.3.7 Cross-sectoral overview of synergies and trade-offs between climate change mitigation and 

the SDGs  

Based  on a  qualitative  assessment  in the sectoral chapters  6,  7,  8, 9,  10,  and  11,  Figure  17.1  below 
provides an overview of the most likely links between sectoral mitigation options and SDGs in terms 
of synergies and trade-offs. The general overview provided in the figure is supplemented by specific 
sector  by  sector  comments  on  how  the  synergies  and  trade-offs  mapped  depend  on  the  scale  of 
implementation  and  the  overall  development  context  of  places  where  the  mitigation  options  are 
implemented. For some mitigation options these scaling and context-specific issues imply that there can 
be both synergies and trade-offs in relation to specific SDGs. In addition to the information provided in 
Figure  17.1,  supplementary  material  (Supplementary  Material  Table  17.1)  includes  the  detailed 
background material provided by the sectoral chapters in terms of qualitative information for each of 
the synergies and trade-offs mapped.  
 
The assessment of synergies and trade-offs presented in Figure 17.1 depends on the underlying literature 
assessed  by  the  sectoral  chapters.  In  cases  where  no  information  about  the  links  between  specific 
mitigation options and SDGs are indicated, this does not imply that there are no links, but rather that 
the links have not been assessed by the literature.

Figure 17.1 Trade-offs and synergies between sectoral mitigation options and the SDGs 

 

 
Most of the energy sector options are assessed as having synergies with several SDGs, but there could 
be mixed synergies and trade-offs between SDG 2 ‘zero hunger’ for wind and solar energy, and for 
hydropower due to land-use conflicts and fishery damage. Offshore wind could also have both synergies 
and trade-offs with SDG 14 ‘life below water’ dependent on scale and implementation site, and it is 
emphasized that land-use should be coordinated with biodiversity concerns. Both wind and solar energy

are  assessed  as  having  trade-offs  with  SDG  12  ‘responsible  production  and  consumption’  due  to 
significant material consumption and disposal needs.  
 
Geothermal energy is assessed as having synergies with SDG 1 ‘zero poverty’ due to energy access and 
mixed synergies and trade-offs in relation to SDG 3 ‘good health and well-being’ due to reduced air 
pollution, but with some risks in relation to water pollution, and in relation to SDG  ‘clean water and 
sanitation’, if it is not well managed. Nuclear power is assessed as having synergies with SDG 3 ‘good 
health and well-being’ due to reduced air pollution, but potential trade-offs in relation to SDG 6 ‘clean 
water and sanitation’ due to high water consumption, and water consumption issues are also possible in 
relation to many of the other mitigation options in the energy sector. Synergies are identified in relation 
to  SDG  12  ‘responsible  production  and  consumption’  for  nuclear  power  due  to  low  material 
consumption. CCUS has been assessed as having trade-offs in relation SDG 1 ‘end poverty’ due to high 
costs and SDG 6 ‘clean water and sanitation’ due to high water consumption. Synergies are related to 
SDG3 ‘improved health and well-being’, and to SDG 9 ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’ due to 
the facilitation of decarbonisation of industrial processes. Both synergies and trade-offs could arrive in 
relation  to  SDG  12  ‘responsible  production  and  consumption’,  since some  rare chemicals and  other 
inputs could in some cases be used with large-scale applications.   
 
Bioenergy use as a fuel is assessed as one of the energy-sector mitigation options with most synergies 
and trade-offs with the SDGs. There could be synergies with SDG 1 ‘no poverty’, with SDG 8 ‘decent 
work and economic growth’ and SDG 9 ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’, This option, however, 
if combined with CCS, can be expensive and can compromise SDG1 ‘end poverty’ due to the high costs 
involved. 
 
Agriculture, forestry and other land-use mitigation options are very closely linked to the SDGs and offer 
both synergies and trade-offs, which in many cases are highly dependent on the scale of implementation. 
All  the  mitigation  options included in  Figure  17.1  are  assessed  as  potentially  having synergies  with 
SDG 1 ‘end poverty’, but trade-offs could also happen if large areas are used for biocrops and taken 
away from other activities, thus causing poverty, as well as in relation to food costs if healthier diets 
are  made  more  expensive.  In  relation  to  SDG  2  ‘zero  hunger’,  most  of  the  mitigation  options  are 
assessed as being associated with both synergies and trade-offs. Trade-offs are particularly a risk with 
large-scale  applications  of  afforestation  projects,  bioenergy  crops  and  other  land-hungry  activities, 
which can crowd out food production. 
 
SDG  ‘good  health  and  well-being’  can  be  supported  by  many  mitigation  options  in  the  agriculture, 
forestry and food sectors, primarily due to the reduced environmental impacts, and the same is the case 
with  SDG  14  ‘life  below  water’  due  to  decreased  nutrient  loads,  and  SDG  15  ‘life  on  land’  due  to 
increased biodiversity, with the caveat however, that SDGs 14 and 15 could have both synergies and 
trade-offs dependent on land use. It is considered that there could be both synergies and trade-offs in 
relation to SDG 8 ‘decent work and economic growth’ due to competition over land use related to the 
mitigation options reducing deforestation and reforestation and restoration, and the same is the case in 
relation to SDG 7 ‘affordable and clean energy’ depending on the economic outcome of the mitigation 
options.  Similarly  the  mitigation  option  of  reduced  CH4  and  N2O  emissions  from  agriculture  are 
assessed as having mixed impacts on SDG 8 ‘decent work and economic growth’, and SDG 9 ‘industry, 
innovation  and  infrastructure’  depending  on  innovative  food  production.  The  mitigation  options  of 
reforestation  and  forest  management  are  assessed  as  having  mixed  impacts  on  SDG  10  ‘reduced 
inequalities’  depending  on  the  involvement  of  local  communities  in  projects.  The  assessment 
emphasises that the synergies and trade-offs of the mitigation options with the SDGs in this sector are 
very context- and scale-dependent, depending on how measures are carried out, for example, in relation 
to the enhanced production of renewables needed  to replace fossil fuel-based products. If done  on a 
massive scale and not adapted to local circumstances, there are adverse implications for food security, 
livelihoods and biodiversity. 
 
All  the  urban  mitigation  options  that  have  been  assessed  are  considered  to  have  synergies  with  the 
SDGs, and in a few cases both synergies and trade-offs are identified. In general, many links between

mitigation options in the urban area and the SDGs have been identified in the literature. Urban land-use 
and spatial planning, for example, can support SDG1 ‘end poverty’, and can also reduce vulnerability 
to climate change if integrated planning is undertaken, while access to food (SDG 2 ‘zero hunger’), and 
water (SDG 6) can also be achieved if supported by integrated planning. Electrification, district heating, 
and  green  and  blue  infrastructure  in  urban  areas  are  expected  to  have  synergies  with  all  the  SDGs 
addressed by the reviewed studies.  
 
Mitigation  options  like  waste prevention  minimization  and management are  also  assessed  as  having 
many synergies with the SDGs, but trade-offs could depend on the application of air-pollution control 
technologies, and on the character of informal waste-recycling activities. The impacts of the possible 
synergies  and/or  trade-offs  with  the  SDGs  will  change  according  to  the  specific  urban  context. 
Synergies  and/or  trade-offs  may  be  more  significant  in  certain  contexts  than  others.  Regarding  the 
SDGs,  urban  mitigation  can  support  shifting  pathways  of  urbanization  towards  sustainability.  The 
feasibility  of  urban  mitigation  options  is  also  malleable  and  can  increase  with  more  enablers. 
Strengthened  institutional  capacity  that  also  supports  the  scale  and  coordination  of  the  mitigation 
options can increase the synergies between urban mitigation options and the SDGs. 
 
As for the urban mitigation options, the reviewed buildings sector studies reveal a lot of links between 
mitigation and the SDGs. Highly efficient building envelopes are expected to have synergies with the 
SDGs in all cases except those with potential trade-offs in relation to SDG 10 ‘reduced inequalities in 
relation to incomes’. Many SDG synergies are also identified for the building design and performance, 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and efficient appliances mitigation options. However, some 
trade-offs could appear in relation to SDG 8 ‘decent work and economic growth’ due to macroeconomic 
impacts  of  reduced  energy  consumption,  decreasing  prices  and  stranded  investments.  Similar  issues 
related  to  the  economic  impacts  of  reduced  energy  demand  are  also  highlighted  for  all  the  other 
mitigation options, included for the building sector. In relation to construction materials and the circular 
economy, some trade-offs have been identified in relation to SDG 6 ‘clean water and sanitation’ and 
SDG 15 ‘life on land’ related to the use of biobased materials.  
 
Consideration of the  building sector highlights important context-specific issues related to synergies 
and trade-offs between mitigation options and SDGs such as the economic impacts (synergies and trade-
offs)  associated  with  reduced  energy  demand,  resulting  in  lower  energy  prices,  energy  efficiency 
investments,  the  fostering  of  innovation  and  improvements  in  labour  productivity.  Furthermore,  the 
distributional costs of some mitigation policies may hinder the implementation of these measures. In 
this case, appropriate access policies should be designed to shield poor households efficiently from the 
burden of carbon taxation. Under real-world conditions, improved cookstoves have shown smaller, and 
in many cases limited, long-term health and environmental impacts than expected, as the households 
use these stoves irregularly and inappropriately, and fail to maintain them, so that their usage declines 
over time. Specific distributional issues are highlighted in relation to various cookstove programs.  
 
The mitigation options in the transportation sector are assessed as having synergies with SDG 1 ‘no 
poverty’  and  SDG  3  ‘good  health  and  well-being’  due  to  reduced  environmental  pollution,  with 
exceptions in relation to pollution from biofuels and the risks of traffic accidents. Trade-offs are also 
mentioned in relation SDG 2 ‘zero hunger’ where the production of biofuels takes land away from food 
production. Synergies are assessed in relation to SDG 7 ‘affordable and clean energy’, SDG 8 ‘decent 
work and economic growth’ and SDG 9 ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’. It is emphasized that 
some mitigation options, like the increased penetration of electric vehicles, require innovative business 
models, and that digitalization and automatic vehicles will support the socio-economic structures that 
impede adoption of EV’s and the urban structures that enable reduced car dependence. In conclusion, 
there is a need for investments in infrastructure that can support alternative fuels for LDVs. The large-
scale electrification of LDVs requires the expansion of low-carbon power systems, while charging or 
battery-swapping infrastructure is needed for some segments.  
 
The mitigation options in the industrial sector have been assessed primarily as having synergies with 
meeting the SDGs. Several options, including energy efficiency, material recycling and electrification,

are assessed has being able to create increased employment and business opportunities related to SDG 
8 ‘decent work and economic growth’, but material efficiency improvements could reduce tax revenues. 
Electrification  is  assessed  as  having  many  synergies  with  SDGs,  such  as  supporting  SDG  1  ‘end 
poverty’, SDG 2 ‘zero hunger’, and SDG 3 ‘good health and well-being’. CCS applied in industry is 
assessed as having synergies in terms of the control of non-CO2 pollutants (such as sulphur dioxide), 
but  increases  in  non-CO2  pollutants  (such  as  particulate  matter,  nitrogen  oxide  and  ammonia).  The 
conclusion  is  that  15-25%  additional  energy  will  be  required  by  CCS  technologies  compared  with 
conventional plants, implying that production costs could increase significantly. For the industrial sector 
in general, it is concluded that the balance between synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options 
and SDGs in industry depends on technology and the scale of the sharing of co-benefits across regions, 
as well as on the sharing of benefits in business models over whole value chains. 
 
Thus a number of cross-sectoral conclusions on synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options 
and the SDGs appear from the overview provided in Figure 17.1. There are many synergies in all sectors 
between mitigation options and the SDGs, and in a few cases there are also significant trade-offs that it 
is very important to address, since they can compromise major SDGs including SDG1 ‘no poverty’, 
SDG 2 ‘zero hunger’, and in some cases SDG 14 and SDG 15 ‘life below water’ and ‘life on land’. In 
particular,  mitigation  options  in  relation  to  land-use,  such  as  afforestation  and  reforestation  and 
bioenergy crops, can in some cases imply trade-offs with access to food and local sharing of benefits, 
but synergies can also exist if proper land management and cross-sectoral policies take sustainable land-
use into account. The impacts and trade-offs for this sector are highly scale- and context-dependent, so 
the final outcome of mitigation policies should be considered in detail.  
 
The  urban  systems  and  transportation  could  potentially  achieve  many  synergies  between  mitigation 
policies and the SDGs, but integrated planning and infrastructure management are critical to avoiding 
trade-offs. Similarly, the buildings sector and industry have identified many potential synergies between 
mitigation options and the SDGs, but that raises issues related to the costs of new technologies, and in 
relation to households and buildings important equity issues are emerging in relation to the ability of 
low-income  groups  to  afford  the  introduction  of  new  technologies.  Altogether  these  cross-sectoral 
conclusions call for a need to support policies that aid coordination between different sectoral domains 
and  that  include  context-specific  assessments  of  the  sharing  of  benefits  and  costs  related  to  the 
implementation of mitigation options.  
 
 
17.4  Key barriers and enablers of the transition: synthesizing results  

This section provides a deep and broad synthesis of theory (section 17.2) and evidence (section 17.3) 
in  order  to  identify  the  conditions  that  either  enable  or  inhibit  transitions  to  sustainable  low-carbon 
futures. Following the literature on sustainability transitions (see Cross-chapter Box 12 on Transition 
Dynamics), the section finds that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing such 
transitions.  Rather,  marked  departures  from  business  as  usual  typically  involve  several  factors, 
including technological innovations, shifts in markets, concerted efforts by scientists and civil-society 
organizations to raise awareness of the costs of continued emissions, social movements, policies and 
governance arrangements, and changes in belief systems and values.  
 
All of this comes together in a co-evolutionary process that has unfolded globally, internationally and 
locally over several decades (Hansen and Nygaard 2014; Rogge et al. 2017; Sorman et al. 2020), and 
that  may  be  guided  or  facilitated  by  interventions  that  target  leverage  points  in  the  underlying 
development path (Burch and Di Bella 2021; Leventon et al. 2021). While transitions necessarily follow 
context-specific trajectories, more general lessons can be drawn by comparing the empirical details with 
both system-level and narrower explanations of change.  
 
Sections 17.2 and 17.3 show that transitions often face multiple barriers, including infrastructure lock-
in, behavioural, cultural and institutional inertia (Markard et al. 2020), trade-offs between transitions

and other social or political priorities (Chu 2016), cost and a reliable (and growing) supply of renewable 
energy  technologies  and  constituent  materials  (García-Olivares  et  al.  2018).  Transitions  away  from 
fossil fuels and toward renewable energy-based systems, for instance, will require significant land-use 
decisions to avoid negative trade-offs with biodiversity and food security (Capellán-Pérez et al. 2017). 
Previous sections underline a related need to move beyond focusing on “rational” assessments of the 
costs and benefits of policies and technologies to involve people at all levels in order to overcome these 
multiple  barriers.  For  example,  the  case  of  coal-fired  power  in  China  (section  17.3)  shows  that  a 
transition to a lower carbon system is unlikely to happen even if models find it technically feasible and 
cost-effective.  Rather,  achieving  a  transition  requires  breaking  locked-in  high-carbon  technological 
trajectories,  path  dependencies  and  resistance  to  change  from  the  industries  and  actors  that  are 
benefiting from the current system (Rogge et al. 2017). Lock-in effects may be weaker in sectors and 
policy areas where fewer technologies exist, potentially opening the door to innovations that embed the 
climate  in  broader  sustainability  objectives  (e.g.,  technologies  and  innovations  that  support  the 
integration of food, water and energy goals). Such effects may still happen when there are significant 
information asymmetries and high-cost barriers to action, as can occur when working across multiple 
climate and development-related sectors (Kemp and Never 2017).  
 
However,  the  same  conditions  that  may  serve  to  impede  a  transition  (i.e.,  organizational  structure, 
behaviour, technological lock-in) can also be ‘flipped’ to enable it (Burch 2010; Lee et al. 2017), while 
the framing of policies that are relevant to the sustainable development agenda can also create a stronger 
basis and stronger policy support. The technological developments and broader cultural changes that 
may  generate  new  social  demands  on  infrastructure  to  contribute  to  sustainable  development  will 
involve a process of social learning and awareness building (Naber et al. 2017; Sengers et al. 2019). 
However, it is also important to note that strong shocks to these systems, including accelerated climate-
change impacts, economic crises and political changes, may provide crucial openings for accelerated 
transitions to sustainable systems through fundamental institutional changes (Broto et al. 2014). The 
global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  one  such  shock  that  has  sparked  widespread  conversations  about 
recovery  that  is  fundamentally  more  sustainable,  equitable  and  resilient  (McNeely  and  Munasinghe 
2021). Key enabling conditions appear to be individual and collective actions, including leadership and 
education; financial, material, social and technical drivers that foster innovation; robust national and 
regional innovation systems that enhance technological diffusion (Wieczorek 2018); supportive policy 
and governance dynamics at multiple levels that permit both agility and coherence (see e.g. Göpel et al. 
2016); measures to recognize and address the challenges to equality inherent in the transition; and long-
range,  holistic  planning  that  explicitly  seeks  synergies  between  climate  change  and  sustainable 
development while avoiding trade-offs. The sections that follow seek to assess and integrate these key 
categories  of  the  barriers  to  and  enablers  of  an  accelerated  transition  to  sustainable  development 
pathways.  
 
17.4.1  Behavioural and lifestyle changes 

Transitions  toward  more  sustainable  development  pathways  are  both  an  individual  and  a  collective 
challenge, requiring an examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs  and structures that shape 
behaviour, and of the dynamics of social movements and education at the local community, regional 
and  global  levels.  Labelling  the  carbon  included  in  products,  for  example,  could  help  the  decision-
making  process  and  increase  awareness  and  knowledge.  Individual  action  suggests  aggregated  but 
uncoordinated  actions  taken  by  individuals,  whereas  collective  sustainability  actions  involve 
coordination, a process of participation and governance that may ensure more efficient, equitable and 
effective outcomes. There is evidence that  the behaviour of individuals and households are part of a 
more encompassing collective action (see also Chapter 5.4.1).  
 
Indeed, individual actions are necessary but insufficient to deliver transformative mitigation, and it is 
suggested  that  this  be  coupled  with  collective  actions  to  accelerate  the  transition  to  sustainable 
development (Dugast et al. 2019). Actors with conflicting interests will compete to frame mitigation 
technologies that either “build or erode” the legitimacy of the technology, contested framing sites that 
can  occur  between  incumbent  and  emerging  actors  or  between  actors  in  new  but  competing  spaces

(Rosenbloom et al. 2016). How narratives are built around desired development pathways and specific 
emerging  technologies,  as  well  as  how  local  values  are  integrated  into  visions  of  the  future,  have 
relevance for how these experiments are managed and enabled to expand (Horcea-Milcu et al. 2020; 
Lam et al. 2020).  
 
17.4.1.1 Social movements and education 
Sustainable  development  and  deep  decarbonization  will  involve  people  and  communities  being 
connected locally through various means – including globally via the internet and digital technologies 
(Bradbury 2015; Scharmer 2018; Scharmer, C, Kaufer 2015) –in ways that form social fields that allow 
sustainability  to  unfold  (see  also  Gillard  et  al.  2016)  and  that  prompt  other  shifts  in  thinking  and 
behaviour that are consistent with the 1.5°C goal (O’Brien 2018; Veciana and Ottmar 2018). Indeed, 
social  movements  serve  to  develop  collective  identities,  foster  collective  learning  and  accelerate 
collective action ranging from energy justice (see Section 17.4.5) (Campos and Marín-González 2020) 
to restricting fossil-fuel extraction and supply (Piggot 2018). This does not apply only to adults: as seen 
in the “Fridays for Future” marches, the young are also involving themselves politically (Peterson et al. 
2019). Many initiatives have started with these marches, including “science for future” and new forms 
of sustainability science (Shrivastava et al. 2020).  
 
It was Theory-U (Scharmer 2018, building on the work of scholars like Schein, Lewin or Senge) that 
inspired a so-called “massive open online course” (MOOC) jointly initiated by the Bhutan Happiness 
Institute and German Technical Assistance (GIZ) in 2015, since when it has been developed further and 
adapted to transform business, society and self as one example of how social movements can go together 
with science and education. It brings together people from different professions, cultures and continents 
in shared discussions and practices of sustainability. It also included marginalised communities and is 
shifting towards more sustainable lifestyles in all sectors (Nikas et al. 2020), including climate action.   
 
Moreover, approaches like the “Art of Hosting”  (Sandfort and Quick 2015) and qualitative research 
methods  like  storytelling  and  first-person  research,  as  well  as  second-person  inquiries,  for  example 
(Scharmer, C, Kaufer 2015; Trullen and Torbert 2004; Varela 1999), have been employed to bridge 
differences in cultures and sciences, as well as to forge connections between those working on climate 
change and sustainable development. Likewise, experiential tools, simulations and role-playing games 
have been shown to increase knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change, the sense 
of urgency around action and the desire to pursue further learning (Ahamer 2013; Eisenack and Reckien 
2013; Hallinger et al. 2020; Rooney-Varga et al. 2020).  
 
The results from these research communities reveal how experiential learning takes place and how it 
encourages  bonding  between  people,  society  and  nature.  This  can  be  achieved  by  going  jointly  and 
consciously  into  nature  (Gioacchino  2019),  by  creating  spaces  for  intensive  dialogue  sessions  with 
colleagues (Goldman-Schuyler et al. 2017) and forming, for example, a very practical u.lab hub, which 
involves  following  the  MIT-u.lab  course  with  a  local  community  and  is  accompanied  scientifically 
(Pomeroy and Oliver 2018). Others have pointed to social networks such as the “transition initiative” 
(Hopkins 2010), eco-village networks ( see e.g., Barani et al. 2018), civil-society movements (Seyfang 
and Smith 2007) and intentional communities (see e.g., Grinde et al. 2018; Veciana and Ottmar 2018) 
as ways of generating the shared understandings that are central to inner and outer transitions, as well 
as the broader development of social movements. In some cases, these networks build on principles like 
permaculture  to  encourage  people  to  “observe  and  interact,”  “produce  no  waste”  and  “design  from 
patterns  to  details”,  not  only  in  agriculture  and  gardening,  but  also  in  sustainable  businesses  and 
technologies to reduce CO2 emissions (see e.g., Ferguson and Lovell 2014; Lessem 2018).  
 
A  related  line  of  inquiry  involves  education  for  sustainable  development  (ESD).  This  builds  on  the 
UNESCO programme, ‘ESD for 2030’, and involves core values like peace culture, valuing cultural 
diversity  and  living  global  citizenship.  One  of  the  core  insights  from  research  on  ESC  is  lifelong 
education continuing outside the classroom, a lifelong learning process that involves sustained actions 
by all ages and social segments (see e.g., Hume and Barry 2015) and achieving collaboration (Munger 
and  Riemer  2012).  Some  authors  have  pointed  to  good  levels  of  communication  either  directly  or

through the internet as the key to facilitating this learning (Sandfort and Quick 2015). Others have noted 
that transformative learning  – that is,  deepening the learning process – is critical because it helps to 
induce both shared awareness and collective actions (see e.g., Brundiers et al. 2010; Singleton 2015; 
Wamsler and Brink 2018).  
 
A  final  area  of  work  points  to  the  importance  of  moving  toward  the  knowledge  production  that 
underpins awareness-raising (Pelling et al. 2015). The accumulation of applied knowledge is leading 
increasingly to the co-design of participatory research with local stakeholders who are investigating and 
transforming  their  own  situations  in  line  with  climate  action  and  sustainable  development  (see  e.g., 
Abson et al. 2017; Fazey et al. 2018; Wiek et al. 2012).  
 
17.4.1.2 Habits, values and awareness 
Many of the cases that explore transitions to sustainable development point to engrained habits, values 
and awareness levels as the most persistent yet least visible barriers to a transition. For example, in the 
transport sector, individuals can quickly become accustomed to personal vehicles, making it difficult 
for them to transition to sustainable, low-carbon modes of public transport. Demand for high-carbon 
transportation may also be locked in, and habits reinforced, if low-cost housing (for instance) is not 
sufficiently  served  by  more  sustainable  (i.e.  mass  transit,  safe  cycling  and  walking  infrastructure) 
transportation options (Mattioli et al. 2020). 
 
This  is  made  all  the  more  challenging  because  car-manufacturing  “incumbents”  utilize  information 
campaigns directed at the public, pursue lobbying and consulting with policy-makers, and set technical 
standards that privilege the status quo and prevent the entry of more sustainable innovations (Smink et 
al. 2015; Turnheim and Nykvist 2019). Tools such as congestion pricing, however, have been shown to 
be  effective  in  motivating  the  switch  from  single-occupancy  vehicle  use  to  public  transit,  thus 
improving air quality and reducing traffic delays in dense city centres (Baghestani et al. 2020).  
 
Complicating the problem further is that even well-intentioned top-down programmes initiated by an 
external actor may in some cases ultimately hinder transformative change (Breukers et al. 2017). For 
instance,  in  Delhi,  India,  attempts  to  introduce  ostensibly  more  sustainable  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT) 
systems failed in part due to an arguably top-down approach that had limited public support. It may 
nonetheless be difficult to win public support (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018), and even grassroots 
initiatives may themselves be contested and dynamic, making it difficult to generate the collective push 
to drive a bottom-up transition forward (Hakansson 2018).  
 
However, dominant, top-down approaches and local, grassroots "alternative" approaches and values do 
overlap and interact. For example, in Manchester, UK, dominant and alternative discourses interact with 
each other to create sustainable transformations through re-scaling (decentralizing) energy generation, 
creating  local  engagement  with  sustainability,  supporting  green  infrastructure  to  reduce  costs,  re-
claiming local land, transforming industrial infrastructure and creating examples of sustainable living 
(Hodson et al. 2017).  
 
Embedding local values in higher-level policy frameworks is also significant for forest communities in 
Nepal and Uganda. Even so, policy intermediaries are not confident that these values will be advanced 
due largely to an emphasis on carbon accounting and the distribution of benefits (Reckien et al. 2018). 
In this case, however, norm entrepreneurs were able to promote the importance of local values through 
the formation of grassroots associations, media campaigns and international support networks (Reckien 
et al. 2018).  
 
17.4.2  Technological and social innovation  

Individuals  and  organizations,  like  institutional  entrepreneurs,  can  function  to  build  transformative 
capacity through collective action (Brodnik and Brown 2018). The transition from a traditional water-
management  system  to  the  Water  Sensitive  Urban  Design  (WSUD)  model  in  Melbourne  offers  an 
illustration of how whole systems can be changed in an urban system.

Private-sector  entrepreneurs  also  play  an  important  role  in  fostering  and  accelerating  transitions  to 
sustainable  development  (Burch  et  al.  2016;  Ehnert  et  al.  2018a;  Dale  et  al.  2017).  Sustainable 
entrepreneurs  (SEs),  for  instance,  are  described  as  those  who  participate  in  the  development  of  an 
innovation while simultaneously being rooted in the incumbent energy-intensive system. SE actors who 
have  developed  longer  term  relationships,  both  formal  and  informal,  with  the  public  authorities  can 
have considerable influence on developing novel renewable-energy technologies (Gasbarro et al. 2017). 
Institutions and policies that nurture the activities of sustainable entrepreneurs, in particular small- and 
medium-sized  enterprises  (Burch  et  al.  2016),  can  facilitate  and  strengthen  transitions  toward  more 
sustainable  development  pathways,  as  can  more  fundamental  adjustments  to  underlying  business 
models, rather than relying only on incremental adjustments in the efficiency with which resources are 
used (Burch and Di Bella 2021).  
 
The creation and growth of sustainable energy and clean-tech clusters enable economic development 
and transformation on regional scales. Such clusters can put pressure on incumbent technologies and 
rules to accelerate energy transitions. Successful clusters are nurtured by multi-institutional and multi-
stakeholder  actors  building  institutional  support  networks,  facilitating  collaboration  between  sectors 
and actors, and promoting learning and social change. Notably, regional economic clusters generate a 
buzz,  which  can  have  a  strong  influence  on  public  acceptance,  support  and  enthusiasm  for 
sociotechnical transitions (McCauley and Stephens 2012).  
 
In Norway, many incumbent energy firms have already expanded their operations into the alternative 
energy sector as both producers and suppliers (who often follow the lead of producers). Producers are 
responding to perceptions of larger-scale changes in the energy landscape (e.g., the green shift), along 
with  uncertainties  in  their  own  sectors,  and  innovation  can  spill  across  actors  in  multiple  sectors  
(Koasidis et al. 2020). While these firms are expanding out of self-interest, the expansion provides more 
legitimacy  to  new  forms  of  technology  and  enables  transfers  of  knowledge  and  resources  to  be 
introduced within this developing niche (Steen and Weaver 2017). Many large, well-established firms 
are  pursuing  sustainability  agendas  and  opting  for  transparency  with  regard  to  their  greenhouse  gas 
emissions (Guenther et al. 2016; Kolk et al. 2008), supply chain management (Formentini and Taticchi 
2016) and sustainable technology or service development (Dangelico et al. 2016).  
 
Experiments with the transition open up pathways that can lead to energy transitions on broader scales. 
Experiments can build capacity by developing networks and building bridges between diverse actors, 
leveraging capital from government funds, de-risking private- and public-sector investment, and acting 
as hubs for public education and engagement (Rosenbloom et al. 2018).  
 
Material barriers and spatial dynamics (Coenen et al. 2012; Hansen and Coenen 2015) are other critical 
obstacles to innovation: often, infrastructure and built environments change more slowly than policies 
and institutions due to the inherently long lifespans of fixed assets (Turnheim and Nykvist 2019). The 
example of transport infrastructure in Ontario, Canada, illustrates the need to integrate climate change 
into  these  infrastructural  decisions  in  the  very  short  term  to  combat  the  risk  of  being  left  with 
unsustainable planning features long into the future, especially combustion engines, significant road 
networks and suburbanization (Birch 2016).  
 

17.4.3  Financial systems and economic instruments 

Market-oriented policies, such as carbon taxes and green finance, can promote low-carbon technology 
and encourage  both  private  and  public investment  in enabling  transitions.  Policies that are  currently 
being  tested  include  loan  guarantees  for  renewable  energy  investments  in  Mali,  policy  insurance  to 
reduce credit defaults within the feed-in tariff regime in Germany, or pledged funding to fully finance 
or partner private firms in order to advance renewable energy projects  (Roy et al. 2018a). However, 
there may be some limitations in using carbon-pricing alone (rather than in combination with flexible 
regulations  and  incentives)  where  market  failures  hinder  low-carbon  investments  (Campiglio  2016; 
World Bank 2019) and high political costs are incurred (Van Der Ploeg 2011).

Many forms of transformational change to energy systems are not possible when financial systems still 
privilege investing in unsustainable, carbon-intensive sectors. One of the root causes of the failure of 
traditional financial systems is the undervaluation of natural capital and unsettled property right issues 
that  are  associated  with  it.  The  exclusion  of  proper  rents  for  scarcities  or  for  global  and  local 
externalities, including climate change, can undermine larger-scale changes to energy systems (Clark 
et al. 2018). But even smaller-scale low-carbon energy and infrastructure projects can fail to get off the 
ground if uncertainty and investment risk discourage project planning and bank-lending programmes 
(Bolton et al. 2016). The EU's previous actions regarding the "shareholder maximisation norm" and 
non-binding measures  have  created  path  dependencies,  limiting  its  flexibility  in  creating  sustainable 
financial legislation. However, the Sustainable Finance Initiative and the Single Market may prove to 
be  "policy  hotspots"  in  encouraging  sustainable  finance  (Ahlström  2019).Taking  advantage  of  these 
hotspots may be crucial in overcoming path dependencies and setting new ones in motion.  
 
One possible positive turn in this regard is the acceleration in investing in the environment (impact and 
ESG) globally: for instance, there is evidence that some institutional investors are divesting from coal, 
potentially  auguring  well  for  the  future  (Richardson  2017).  The  encouragement  of  governance  and 
policy reforms that could facilitate similar expansions of investment in sustainable firms and sectors 
(Clark et al. 2018; Owen et al. 2018) could contribute to the dynamic feedback that gives a transition 
lift and injects momentum into it. Also, the degrowth movement, with its focus on sustainability over 
profitability, has the potential to speed up transformations using alternative practices like fostering the 
exchange of non-monetary goods and services if large numbers of stakeholders want to invest in these 
areas (Chiengkul 2017).  
 
17.4.4  Institutional capacities and multi-level governance 

Capable  institutions  and  multi-level  governance  often  support  the  inter-agency  coordination  and 
stakeholder coalitions that drive sustainable transitions. Such institutions and governance arrangements 
are frequently required to formulate and implement the multi-sectoral policies that spur the adoption 
and scaling of innovative solutions to climate change and other sustainable development challenges. 
For example, such institutional and governance conditions have helped support the industrial policies 
that  will  be  needed  to  spread  renewables through the creation  of  domestic  supply  chains  (Zenghelis 
2020) or to pilot CDR methods (Quarton and Samsatli 2020).  

However, government agencies with climate and other remits do not always work well together: the 
absence of coordination and consensus building mechanisms can further deepen inter-agency conflicts 
that  stall  a  transition.  These  challenges  appear  not  only  within  but  also  between  levels  of  decision-
making. Studies of developing megacities, for instance, have found the lack of mechanisms promoting 
vertical cross-level integration to be a sizable constraint on decarbonisation (Canitez 2019). Differences 
in perspectives across non-state actors can similarly frustrate transitions in areas such as green buildings 
(Song et al. 2020).  
 
Here coordination complicates matters: coalition-building may require mutually reinforcing changes to 
institutions and policies. For example, decentralized renewable energy has made progress in Argentina, 
but consumer electricity subsidies give agencies and firms supporting conventional energy an advantage 
over  those  promoting  renewable  energy.  Similarly,  the  lack  of  concrete  guidance  in  green  finance 
policies can deprive government agencies and other stakeholders of the information needed to balance 
ecological  and  financial  goals  (Wang  and  Zhi  2016).  Many  of  these  challenges  can  be  particularly 
formidable in developing countries, where agencies lack sufficient financial and other capacities. A lack 
of  government  funds  to  cover  ongoing  maintenance  costs  along  with  resource  shortages  in  rural 
locations can pose constraints on sustainable energy (Schaube et al. 2018).  
 
Building  inter-agency  or  multiple  stakeholders  is  frequently  challenging  because  of  the  mutually 
reinforcing interactions between institutions and ideas. The imperceptible embedding of long-standing 
development paradigms (such as ‘grow now, clean up later’) in agency rules and standard operating 
procedures  can  make changes  to  governance  arrangements  challenging.  This  is partly  because these

rules  and  procedures  can  also  shape  the  interests  of  key  decision-makers  (e.g.,  the  head  of  an 
environmental agency). For some, this suggests a need to look not just at changing prevailing ideas and 
interests, but also at broader institutional and governance arrangements (Kern 2011).  
 
However,  institutional  and  governance  reforms  can  be  more  than  a  technical  exercise.  Political, 
economic and other power relations can lock in dominant institutional and economic structures, making 
the  integration  of  climate  and  sustainable  development  agendas  exceedingly  difficult.  For  example, 
though there have been recent reforms, the initial lack of early progress in Australia’s energy transition 
is partly attributable to institutions of political economy being oriented to providing steady supplies of 
affordable fossil fuels (Warren et al. 2016). 
 
This suggests that it is important to look closely at the pre-existing political economic system as well 
as  the  institutional  context  and  capacities  in  assessing  the  prospects  for  transitions  to  sustainability. 
Furthermore,  this  is  how  existing  institutions  interact  with  ideas  that  often  strengthen  lock-ins.  To 
illustrate,  studies  have  shown  that  the  status-quo orientations  of leaders (including  decision-makers’ 
disciplinary  backgrounds,  world  views  and  perceptions  of  risk)  (Willis  2018),  as  well  as  the 
organizational  culture  and  management  paradigms  within  which  they  operate,  affect  the  speed  and 
ambitions of climate policies (Rickards et al., 2014).  
 
Some studies have focused on factors that can break institutional and ideational lock-ins (Arranz 2017), 
while others have found that intentional higher-level (or, in the language of socio-technical transitions, 
“landscape”) pressures can be the destabilizing force needed to move transitions forward (Falcone and 
Sica 2015). Often the state or national government (as the sovereign that determines how resources are 
used  and  allocated)  can  play  a  key  role  in  destabilizing  incumbent  energy  regimes,  a  role  that  is 
significantly strengthened by public support (Arranz 2017; Avelino et al. 2016). However, this role is 
not limited to government insiders. In some contexts, regime outsiders have also played a pivotal 
role  in  destabilizing  regimes  by  combining  persuasive  narratives that  gain  market influence  (Arranz 
2017). Carbon-intensive luxury goods and services for wealthy consumers, for instance, especially if 
applied at the "acceleration" phase of a transition, can help transform long-term social practices and 
behaviour  and  dissolve  the  “structural  imperative  for  growth”  (Wiedmann  et  al.  2020).  In  a  similar 
fashion,  environmental  taxes  can  remove  “locked-in”  technology  and  place  pressure  on  dominant 
regimes to become more sustainable (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018).  
 
In  many  contexts,  it  is  not  multiple  institutional  and  policy  variables  that  come  together  to  break 
unsustainable inertias. In South Korea, where the state was an initiator and enabler of change, the clean-
energy transition took much longer than anticipated due to private-sector resistance. However, when 
policy-makers  focused  on  incorporating  adaptive  learning and flexibility into  their  decision-making, 
public-  and private-sector  interests  gradually  converged  and  joined  with  top-down  policy-making  to 
drive the transition forward (Lee et al. 2019). Thus, a political strategy can help align the interests and 
institutions needed to break lock-ins.  
 
This becomes clear in studies that show that political coalitions can affect the speed of transitions (Hess 
2014). These same studies show  that incumbent industry coalitions are now competing with ‘green’ 
coalitions in terms of campaign spending over environmentally-friendly ballot proposals (Hess 2014). 
Another  way  of  shifting  political-economic  incentives  is  by  offering  a  realistic  exit  strategy  for 
incumbents,  like  interventions  that  provide  long-term  incentives  for  renewable  energy  firms  (de 
Gooyert et al. 2016; Hamman 2019).  
 
Overall,  the  previous  subsection  suggests  that  complementary  policies  and  institutions  that 
simultaneously integrate across multiple sectors and scales and also alter political economic structures 
that lock in carbon-intensive energy system are more likely to move a sustainable transition forward 
(Burch 2010). Yet, despite a trend in climate governance towards greater integration and inclusivity and 
certain  other  novel  governance  approaches,  traditional  approaches  to  governance  and  a  tendency  to 
incrementalism  remain  dominant  (Holscher  et  al.  2019).  Building  the  governance  arrangements  and

capacities  that  prioritize  climate  change  across  all  sectors  and  scales  while  destabilizing  entrenched 
interests and putting pressure on existing norms, rules and practices is still needed in many contexts 
(Holscher et al. 2019). 
 
At least three themes require further research in the scholarship on governance of transitions: 1) the role 
of coalitions in supporting and hindering acceleration; 2) the role of feedback, through which policies 
may shape actor preferences, which in turn create stronger policies; and 3) the role of broader contexts 
(political  economies,  institutions,  cultural  norms,  and  technical  systems)  in  creating  conditions  for 
acceleration  (Roberts  et  al.  2018).  Importantly,  these  themes  may  serve  as  both  barriers  to  and 
opportunities for transitions (ibid.).  
 
17.4.5  Equity in a just transition 

Energy justice, although increasingly being emphasized (Pellegrini-Masini et al. 2020), has been under-
represented  in  the  literature  on  sustainability  and  in  debates  on  energy  transitions,  and  it  remains  a 
contested  term  with  multiple  meanings  (Green  and  Gambhir  2020).  Energy  justice  includes 
affordability,  sustainability,  equality  (accessibility  for  current  and  future  households)  and  respect 
(ensuring that innovations do not impose further burdens on particular groups) (Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). 
Furthermore, it suggests that a just transition is a shared responsibility among countries that are making 
more rapid progress towards net negative emissions and those economies that are focused on pressing 
development priorities related to improved health, well-being and prosperity (van den Berg et al. 2020).  

 
Looking at climate change from a justice perspective means placing the emphasis on a) the protection 
of  vulnerable  populations  from  the  impacts  of  climate  change;  b)  mitigating  the  effects  of  the 
transformations themselves, including easing the transition for those whose livelihoods currently rely 
on fossil fuel-based sectors; and c) envisaging an equitable decarbonized world. Neglecting issues of 
justice risks a backlash against climate action generally, particularly from those who stand to lose from 
such actions (Patterson et al. 2018), and it will also have implications for the pace, scale and quality of 
the transition. Explicit interventions to promote sustainability transitions that integrate local spaces into 
the whole development process are necessary but not sufficient in creating a just transition (Breukers et 
al. 2017; Ehnert et al. 2018b).  
 
Renewable energy transitions in rural, impoverished locations can simultaneously reinforce and disrupt 
local power structures and inequalities. Policy interventions to help the most impoverished individuals 
in  a  community  gain  access  to  the  new  energy  infrastructure  are  critical  in  ensuring  that  existing 
inequalities are not reinforced. Individuals who are empowered by energy development projects can 
influence the onward extension of sustainable energy to other communities (Ahlborg 2017). In Denmark 
in the 1970s, for example, grassroots windmill cooperatives opened a pathway to the creation of one of 
the  world’s largest  wind-energy markets.  The  unique  dynamics  of  grassroots-led  changes mean  that 
new technologies and low-carbon initiatives develop strong foundations by being designed, tested and 
improved in the early stages with reference to the socio-political contexts in which they will grow later 
(Ornetzeder and Rohracher 2013).  
 
Intersectional theory can shine a light on the hidden costs of resource extraction, as well as renewable 
energy development (see, for instance, (Chatalova and Balmann 2017), which go beyond environmental 
or health risks to include the socio-cultural impacts on both communities adjacent to these sites and 
those who work in them (Daum 2018). Indeed, development decisions often do not properly integrate 
the burdens and risks placed on marginalized groups, like indigenous peoples, while risk assessments 
tend to reinforce existing power imbalances by failing to differentiate between how benefits and risks 
might impact on certain groups (Healy et al. 2019; Kojola 2019). In some cases, such as the deployment 
of  small-scale  solar  power  in  Tanzania  by  a  non-profit  organization,  an  explicit  gender  lens  on  the 
impacts  of  energy  poverty  revealed  the  significant  socio-economic  benefits  of  improving  access  to 
renewable energy (Gray et al. 2019).

Poor sectoral coordination and institutional fragmentation have triggered a wide range of unsustainable 
uses of resources and threatened the long-term sustainability of food, water and energy security (Rasul 
2016).  Greater  policy  coherence  among  the  three  sectors  is  critical  to  moving  to  a  sustainable  and 
efficient use of resources (United Nations 2019), given that political ambition, values, the energy mix, 
infrastructure and innovation capacities collectively shape transition outcomes (Neofytou et al. 2020). 
Capacity-  and  coalition-building,  particularly  among  sub-national  and  non-state  actors  (e.g.  non-
governmental  organizations)  is  a  particularly  important  enabler  of  greater  coherence  (Bernstein  and 
Hoffmann 2018). The nexus approach, a systems-based methodology that focuses attention on the many 
ways in which natural resources are deeply interwoven and mutually interdependent, can strengthen 
coordination and help to avoid maladaptive pathways (Cremades et al. 2016).  

 
A  major  shift  is  required  in  the  decision-making  process  in  the  direction  of  taking  a  holistic  view, 
developing  institutional  mechanisms  to  coordinate  the  actions  of  diverse  actors  and  strengthening 
complementarities and  synergies  (Nikas  et  al.  2020; Rasul  2016).  Currently,  nexus  approaches have 
moved from purely conceptual arguments to application and implementation. (Liu et al. 2018) suggest 
the  need  for  a  systematic  procedure  and  provide  perspectives  on  future  directions.  These  include 
expanding nexus frameworks that take into account interaction linkages with the SDGs, incorporating 
overlooked  drivers  and  regions,  diversifying  nexus  toolboxes  and  making  these  strategies  central  to 
policy-making and governance in integrating and implementing the SDGs. 
 

In  respect  of  processes,  (Seyfang  and  Haxeltine  2012)  found  a  lack  of  realistic  and  achievable 
expectations among both members (internally) and the wider public (externally), which hampers the 
acceleration of transitions. This movement could concentrate strategically on developing and promoting 
short-term steps towards shared long-term visions, including clearly identifiable goals and end-points. 
Sustainability science must link research on problem structures with a solutions-oriented approach that 
seeks  to  understand,  conceptualize  and  foster  experiments  in  how  socio-technical  innovations  for 
sustainability develop, are diffused and are scaled up (Miller et al. 2014).  
 
Various strategies and processes have been explored that might facilitate the translation of barriers into 
enablers, thus accelerating transitions to sustainable development. Common themes include frequent 
monitoring and system evaluation to reveal the barriers in the first place, the collaborative co-creation 
and  envisioning  of  pathways  toward  sustainable  development,  ambitious  goal-setting,  the  strategic 
tackling of sources of path dependence or inertia, iterative evaluations of progress and risk management, 
adaptive  management  and  building  in  opportunities  for  agile  course-correction  at  multiple  levels  of 
governance (Burch et al. 2014; Halbe et al. 2015). Given the political infeasibility of stable, long-term 
climate policies, the better choice may be to embrace uncertainty in specific policies but entrench the 
low-carbon transition as the overarching goal. Framing climate policy too narrowly, rather than taking 
a more holistic, sustainable development-oriented approach, may tie success to single policies, rather 
than allowing for system-wide change.  
 
Decarbonisation may be encouraged by embedding the transition in a broader socio-economic agenda, 
focusing  on  constructing  social  legitimacy  to  justify  the  transformation,  encouraging  municipalities 
with a material interest in the transition and reforming institutions to support the long-term transition 
goals (Rosenbloom et al. 2019). In jurisdictions where climate and energy policy have been integrated 
and harmonized, such as the UK, progress has been made in transitioning to sustainable energy (Warren 
et al. 2016).  
 
Developing countries that are rich in fossil fuels now have an opportunity to reset their development 
trajectories by focusing on those opportunities that will offer resilient development in land-use change, 
low-carbon  energy  generation  and  not  least  more  efficient  resource-planning  (UN-  UNDRR  2019). 
Resource-rich developing countries can choose an alternative pathway by deciding to monetize carbon 
capital and diversifying away from the high-carbon aspects of risk. Countries rich in hydrocarbons can

diversify their energy mix and maximize their renewable energy potential. For instance, Namibia, a net 
importer of electricity, is seeking to reduce its current dependence on hydrocarbons by promoting solar 
energy.  The  government  has  issued  permits  allowing  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  to  sell 
directly  to  consumers,  thus  ending  the  monopoly  hitherto  enjoyed  by  the  state  utility  company 
NamPower (Kruger et al. 2019).  
 
Cities are important spaces where the momentum to achieve low-carbon transitions can be built (Burch 
2010;  Holscher  et  al.  2019;  Shaw  et  al.  2014),  especially  where  centralized  energy  structures  and 
national  governance  and politics  are posing  deep-rooted  challenges to change  (Dowling et al. 2018; 
Meadowcroft 2011). Cities can enter networks and partnerships with other cities and multilevel actors, 
spaces that are important for capacity-building and accelerating change (Dale et al. 2020; Heikkinen et 
al. 2019; Westman et al. 2021).  
 
Addressing  the  uncertainties  and  complexities  associated  with  locally,  regionally  and  nationally 
sustainable development pathways requires creative methods and participatory processes. These may 
include  powerful  visualizations  that  make  the  implications  of  climate  change  (and  decarbonization) 
clear  locally  (Shaw  et  al.  2014;  Sheppard  et  al.  2011),  other  visual  aids  or  “progress  wheels”  that 
effectively communicate the relevant contexts (Glaas et al. 2019), storytelling and mapping, and both 
analogue and digital games (Mangnus et al. 2019).  
 
 
17.5  Conclusions 

This  chapter  has  been  concerned  to  assess  the  opportunities  and  challenges  for  acceleration  in  the 
context of sustainable development. As such, many of the claims reviewed involve not only increasing 
the  speed  of  the  transition  but  also  ensuring  that  it  is  just,  equitable  and  delivers  a  wider  range  of 
environmental and social benefits. A sustainability transition requires removing the underlying drivers 
of  vulnerability  and  high  emissions  (quality  and  depth)  while  aligning  the  interests  of  different 
communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth).  
 
Interest in a sustainability transition has grown steadily over the history of the IPCC and of climate and 
related policy processes. That interest hit a high point in 2015 with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs. It has continued to remain high as countries 
have issued NDCs on climate change, VNRs on the SDGs and, in some instances, integrated climate 
and SDG plans (or similarly themed integrated actions, e.g. circular economy plans). Interest has also 
gained  momentum  as  local  governments,  businesses  and  other  stakeholders  have  followed  suit  with 
climate change- or SDG-related plans.  
 
Implementing many of the recent pledges, however, has proved challenging. Part of the challenge is a 
need to address everything from public policies and prevailing technologies to individual lifestyles and 
social  norms  to  governance  arrangements  and  institutions  with  associated  political  economy 
implications. These factors can lock in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering 
the  momentum  needed  for  large-scale  transformations  of  socioeconomic  systems.  Another 
consideration is that transition pathways are likely to vary across and within countries due to different 
development levels, starting points, differential vulnerabilities, capacities, agencies, geographies, power 
dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and other contextual factors.  
 
Even with this diversity, prominent lines of economic, institutional, psychological and systems thinking 
have  reflected  on  interventions  that  can  enable  transitions.  Because  these  disciplines  often  focus  on 
different  levels  of  analysis  and  draw  upon  diverse  analytical  methods  and  empirical  evidence,  the 
recommended interventions also tend to vary. For instance, economic arguments often point to the need 
for targeted regulation or investments, institutional claims centre on multilevel governance reforms, and 
psychology encourages participation to change mind sets and social norms. Systems-level perspectives 
offer a useful frame for bringing together these views, but may not capture the richness and details of

them treated separately. Greater inter- and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the more 
focused interventions and show how they work together in a system. Such research will be particularly 
important for working on the concern running through these studies: strengthening synergies between 
climate and the broader sustainable development agenda.  
 
National  and  sub-national,  sectoral  and  cross-sectoral,  short-  and  long-term  transition  studies  have 
assessed the links between sustainable development and mitigation policies and synergies and the trade-
offs between the different policy domains. Some general conclusions can be drawn on synergies and 
trade-offs,  despite  the  actual  impacts  of  policy  implementation  depending  on  scale,  context  and  the 
development starting point.  
 
From a cross-sectoral perspective, it can be concluded that the AFOLU sector offers many low-cost 
mitigation options with synergetic SDG impacts, which, however, can also create trade-offs between 
land-use for food, energy, forest and biodiversity. Some options can help to mitigate such trade-offs, 
like  agricultural  practices,  forest  conservation  and  soil  carbon  sequestration.  Lifestyle  changes, 
including  dietary  changes  and  reduced  food  waste,  could  jointly  support  the  SDGs  and  mitigation. 
Industry  also  offers  several  mitigation  options  with  SDG  synergies,  for  example,  related  to  energy 
efficiency and the circular economy. Some of the renewable-energy options in industry could indicate 
some trade-offs in relation to land use, with implications for food- and water security and costs. Cities 
provide  a  promising  basis  for  implementing  mitigation  with  SDG  synergies,  particularly  if  urban 
planning, transportation, infrastructure and settlements are coordinated jointly. Similarly, studies of the 
building sector have identified many synergies between the SDGs and mitigation, but there are issues 
related to the costs of new technologies. Also, in relation to households and buildings, important equity 
issues emerge due to the ability of low-income groups to afford the introduction of new technologies. 
Altogether  these  cross-sectoral  conclusions  create  a  need  for  policies  to  address  both  synergies  and 
trade-offs, as well as for coordination between different sectoral domains. Context-specific assessments 
of  synergies  and  trade-offs  are  here  important,  as  is  sharing  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with 
mitigation policies.  
 
Several opportunities for creating SDG synergies and avoiding trade-offs have also been identified in 
relation to integrated adaptation and mitigation policies. The AFOLU sector has a large potential for 
integrating adaptation and mitigation policies related to agriculture, bioenergy crops, forestry and water 
use. As was concluded for mitigation options, integrated adaptation and mitigation policies also entail 
the  risks  of  creating  trade-offs  in  relation  to  food,  water,  energy  access  and  biodiversity.  There  are 
several  potentially  strong  links  between  climate-change  adaptation  in  industry  and  climate-change 
adaptation more generally. Various supply chains can be affected by climate change, and mitigation 
options  related  to  energy  and  water  supply  can  be  disrupted  by  climate  events,  implying  that  great 
benefits  may  come  from  integrating  adaptation  in  industrial  planning  efforts.  Adaptation  options  in 
industry can imply increasing the demand for packaging materials such as plastics and for access to 
refrigeration,  which  are  also  major  sources  of  GHG  emissions,  which  then  would  require  further 
mitigation options. Mitigation and the co-benefits of adaptation in urban areas in relation to air quality, 
health, green jobs and equality issues can in most cases to be synergetic and can also support the SDGs. 
One  exception  are  compact  cities,  with  their  trade-offs  between  mitigation  and  adaptation  because 
decreasing  urban  sprawl  can  increase  the  risks  of  flooding  and  heat  stress.  Detailed  mapping  of 
mitigation and adaptation in urban areas shows that there are many, very close interactions between the 
two policy domains and that coordinated governance across sectors is therefore called for. 
 
Meeting the ambitions of the Paris Agreement will require phasing out fossil fuels from energy systems, 
which is technically possible and is estimated to be relatively low in cost. However, studies also show 
that  replacing  fossil  fuels  with  renewables  can  have  major  synergies  and  trade-offs  with  a  broader 
agenda of sustainable development if a balance is established in relation to land use, food security and 
job creation (McCollum et al. 2018). Furthermore, the transition to low-emission pathways will require 
policy  efforts  that  also  address  the  emissions  locked  into  existing  infrastructure,  like  power  plants, 
factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure already in use: for example, today coal-fired power plants 
account for 30% of all energy-related emissions. Thus, even though the transition away from fossil fuels

is  desirable  and  technically  feasible,  it  is  still  largely  constrained  by  existing  fossil  fuel-based 
infrastructure  and  the  existence  of  stranded  investments.  The  “committed”  emissions  from  existing 
fossil-fuel infrastructure may consume all the remaining carbon budget  in the 1.5°C scenario or two 
thirds of the carbon budget in the 2°C scenario. 
 
Stranded hydrocarbon assets, including hydrocarbon resources and the infrastructure from which they 
are  produced,  and  investments  made  in  exploration  and  production  activities,  are  likely  to  become 
unusable, lose value, or may end up as liabilities before the end of the anticipated economic lifetime. 
This phenomenon is rapidly becoming a global reality as social norms change and the pressure to reduce 
emissions  mounts.  Energy  and  other  forms  of  structural  inequities  are  likely  to  make  the  transition 
planning more challenging, especially given stranded assets.  
 
Countries dependent on fossil fuel income will need to forego these revenues to keep well within the 
Paris  agreement  requirements  and  align  with  the  rapidly  growing  divestment  movement.  Climate 
injustice, energy poverty, and COVID 19 have reduced the space and maneuverability for developing 
countries to innovate and use surplus funds to procure new and clean technologies. A rising debt burden 
already hamstrings many.  Decisions on how to spend the remaining carbon budget and who has the 
right to decide on what to do with existing fossil fuels reflect the complexity of the transition and its 
non-linearity character. Given the asymmetrical dimension of energy production, distribution, and use, 
it is likely that stranded assets will have implications for oil-producing countries, especially for early 
producers who perceive that newfound oil and gas will open doors to new forms of prosperity. 
 
While  the  transitional  drivers  are  not  in  place  in  some  developing  countries,  i.e.,  technology, 
infrastructure, knowledge, and finance, among others, investing in new forms of renewable energy for 
land,  energy,  or  water  sectors  will  see  the  emergence  of  a  more  diversified  economy  and  one  less 
vulnerable to carbon and other exogenous risks. The transition away from fossil fuels will come with 
hard  choices.  Still,  these  choices  can  enable  a  sustainable  development  world  and  reduce  the  many 
asymmetries and injustices inherent in the current system, not least the gaping energy disparities that 
divide the developed and the developing world.  
 
Equality and justice are  central dimensions of transitions in the context of sustainable development. 
Viewing  climate  change  through  the  lens  of  justice  requires  a  focus  on  the  protection  of  vulnerable 
populations from the impacts of climate change, addressing the unequal distribution of the costs and 
consequences of the transitions themselves, including for those whose livelihoods are rooted in fossil 
fuel-based  sectors,  and  developing  more  creative  and  participatory  processes  for  envisioning  an 
equitable decarbonized world. Neglecting issues of justice will have implications for the pace, scale and 
quality of the transition. 
 
Ultimately, the evidence demonstrates that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing 
transitions. A constellation of elements come into play, including technological innovations, shifts in 
markets, social and behavioural dynamics, and governance arrangements. Indeed, transitions require an 
examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs and the structures that shape behaviour, as well as 
the dynamics of social movements and education at multiple levels. Likewise, technological and social 
innovation both play an important role in enabling transitions, highlighting the importance of multi-
institutional  and  multi-stakeholder  actors  building  institutional  support  networks,  facilitating 
collaboration between sectors and actors, and promoting learning and social change. Financial tools and 
economic  instruments  are  crucial  enablers,  since  many  forms  of  transformational  change  to  energy 
systems  are  not  possible  when  financial  systems  still  privilege  investing  in  unsustainable,  carbon-
intensive sectors. These instruments are deployed within the context of the multi-level governance of 
climate  change,  which  suggests  the  importance  of  complementary  policies  and  institutions  that 
simultaneously integrate across multiple sectors and scales to address the multiple sources of lock-in 
that  are  shaping  the  current  carbon-intensive  energy  system.  Systems-oriented  approaches,  which 
holistically address the intersections among climate, water and energy (for instance), have significant 
potential to reveal and help avoid trade-offs, foster experimentation, and deliver a range of co-benefits 
on the path towards sustainable development.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

FAQ  17.1  Will  decarbonisation  efforts  slow  or  accelerate  sustainable  development 
transitions? 
 
Sustainable  development  offers  a  comprehensive  pathway  to  achieving  ambitious  climate  change 
mitigation goals. Sustainable development requires the pursuit of synergies and the avoidance of trade-
offs between the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. It can thus provide 
pathways  that  accelerate  progress  towards  ambitious  climate  change  mitigation  goals.  Factoring  in 
equality and distributional effects will be particularly important in the pursuit of sustainable policies 
and partnerships, and in accelerating the transition to sustainable development. Using climate change 
as a key conduit can only work if synergies across sectors are exploited and if policy implementation is 
supported by national and international partnerships. 
 
The speed, quality, depth and scale of the transition will depend on the developmental starting point, 
that  is,  on  explicit  goals  as  well  as  the  enabling  environment  consisting  of  individual  behaviour, 
mindsets,  beliefs  and  actions,  social  cohesion,  governance,  policies,  institutions,  social  and 
technological innovations etc. The integration of both climate change mitigation and adaptation policies 
in  sustainable  development  is  also  essential  in  the  establishment  of  fair  and  robust  transformation 
pathways.  
 
FAQ 17.2 What role do considerations of justice and inclusivity play in the transition towards 
sustainable development? 
Negative economic and social impacts in some regions could emerge as a consequence of ambitious 
climate change mitigation policies if these are not aligned with key sustainable development aspirations 
such as those represented by the  SDGs on ‘no poverty, energy-, water- and food access’ etc., which 
could in turn slow down the transition process. Nonetheless, many climate change mitigation policies 
could generate incomes, new jobs and other benefits. Capturing these benefits could require specific 
policies  and  investments  to  be  targeted  directly  towards  including  all  parts  of  society  in  the  new 
activities and industries created by the climate change mitigation policies, and that activities that are 
reduced in the context of transitions to a low carbon future, including industries and geographical areas, 
are seeing new opportunities. Poor understanding of how governance at multiple levels can meet these 
challenges to the transition may fail to make significant progress in relation to national policies and a 
global  climate  agreement.  It  may  therefore  either  support  or  weaken  the  climate  architecture,  thus 
constituting a limiting factor. 
  
FAQ 17.3 How critical are the roles of institutions in accelerating the transition and what can 
governance enable? 
 
Institutions are critical in accelerating the transition towards sustainable development: they can help to 
shape climate change response strategies in terms of both adaptation and mitigation. Local institutions 
are  the  custodians  of  critical  adaptation  services,  ranging  from  the  mobilisation  of  resources,  skills 
development  and  capacity-building  to  the  dissemination  of  critical  strategies.  Transitions  towards 
sustainable  development  are  mediated  by  actors  within  particular  institutions,  the  governance 
mechanisms  they  use  as  implementing  tools  and  the  political  coalitions  they  form  to  enable  action. 
Patterns of production and consumption have implications for a low-carbon development, and many of 
these  patterns  can  act  as  barriers  or  opportunities  towards  sustainable  development.  Trade  policies, 
international  economic issues  and international  financial  flows  can  positively  support  the  speed  and 
scale of the transition; alternatively, they can have negative impacts on policies that may inhibit the 
process. Nonetheless, contextual factors are a fundamental part of the change process, and institutions 
and their governance systems provide pathways that can influence contextual realities on the ground. 
For  instance,  politically  vested  interests  may  lead  powerful  lobby  groups  or  coalition  networks  to 
influence the direction of the transition, or they could put pressure on a given political elite through the

imposition  of  regulatory  standards,  taxation,  incentives  and  policies  that  may  speed  or  delay  the 
transition  process.  Civil  society  institutions,  such  as  NGOs  or  research  centres,  can  act  as  effective 
governance ‘watch dogs’ in the transition process, particularly when they exercise a challenge function 
and question government actions in respect of transitions related to sustainable development.
