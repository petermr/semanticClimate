Rather, it involves expediting the pace of change (speed) while also removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high emissions (quality and depth) and aligning the interests of different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth). One key to enabling deep and broad transitions is integrating the views of different government agencies, businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in transition processes. Another critical driver of deep and broad transitions is engaging and empowering workers, youth,  women,  the  poor,  minorities  and  marginalized  stakeholders  in  just,  equitable  and  inclusive processes. The result of such processes will be the transformation of large-scale socioeconomic systems to restore the health and well-being of the planet and the people on it.   </span></div><div style="" id="id1434"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1435">Section  17.1  begins  by  reviewing  how  climate  and  sustainability  issues  have  been  discussed  in  the Intergovernmental  Process  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  as  well  as  international  climate  change  and sustainable development processes at different levels. It further introduces key themes addressed in the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1439">chapter&#8217;s remaining subsections.

From the early stages of the IPCC assessment process, this challenge and the inherent link between climate  change  and  sustainable  development  have  been  well  recognized.  For  example,  the  First Assessment Report (FAR) highlighted the relevance of sustainable development for climate policy. The Second Assessment Report (SAR) went further to include equity issues in its presentation of sustainable development. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Banuri et al. 2001) made the link even stronger, noting that "parties have a right to and should promote sustainable development" (as stated in the text of the  UNFCCC  2015  (Article  3.4)),  and  offering  an early review  of  studies  integrating  sustainable development and climate change. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (Sathaye et al. 2007) added an additional perspective to these interconnections, acknowledging the existence of a two-way relationship between sustainable development and climate change. </span></div><div style="" id="id1469"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1470">The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Denton et al. 2014; Fleurbaey et al. 2014) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5</span><span style="font-family: SymbolMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1472">&#61616;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1473">C (IPCC 2018; Roy et al. 2018a) have arguably made the strongest links between climate and sustainable development to date. One of the key messages of AR5 was that the implementation  of  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  actions  could  help  promote  sustainable development,  and  it  emphasized  the  need  for  transformational  changes  in  this  regard.  AR5  also concluded  that  the  link  between  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  is  cross-cutting  and complex, and that thus the impacts of climate change are threatening the efforts being made to achieve sustainable development.

<div style="" id="id1676"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1677">Despite the clear links between sustainable development and climate change being recognised from the early stages of the IPCC, climate change has often been portrayed as an environmental problem to be addressed chiefly by environmental ministries (Brown et al. 2007; Munasinghe 2007; Swart and Raes 2007).  However,  this  perception  has  evolved  over  time.  It  is  now  increasingly  common  to  see governments and other actors understand the wider ramifications of a changing climate for sustainable development. In a growing number of studies, work on climate policies and just transitions towards sustainable  development  are  framed  as going  hand in  hand  (Fuso  Nerini  et  al.  2019;  Dugarova  and G&#252;lasan 2017; Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Schramade 2017; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1686"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1687">17.1.2  Integrating  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  International </span></div><div style="" id="id1689"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1690">Policymaking Processes  </span></div><div style="" id="id1692"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1693">Among  the  reasons  for  the  growing  realization  of  these  interdependencies  are  milestones  in international climate and sustainable development processes. As outlined in Chapter 14, the year 2015 was  a  turning  point  due  to  two  agreements:  1)  the  Paris  Agreement;  and  2)  the  2030  Agenda  on Sustainable Development and its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Farzaneh et al. 2021).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1699"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1700">Following  a  long  history  of  references  to  sustainable  development  in  the  UNFCCC  and  related agreements,  the  Paris  Agreement  helped  to  strengthen  the  links  between  climate  and  sustainable development by emphasizing  that sustainability is related to its objectives (Sindico 2016; UNFCCC 2016). One of the ways that it helped tighten this link is by institutionalizing bottom-up pledges and the review  architecture.  Toward  this  end,  the  Paris  Agreement  instituted  nationally  determined contributions  (NDCs)  as  vehicles  through  which  countries  make  pledges  and  demonstrate  their commitment to climate action. Although there was no clear guidance on what should be included in the NDCs, some of the requirements were elaborated in the Paris Rule Book (see above, Chapter 14). Some of the submitted NDCs included only mitigation efforts, but others set out mitigation and adaptation goals aligning NDC commitments to national planning processes, while yet others mentioned links with the SDGs. </span></div><div style="" id="id1712"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1713">Another  way  that  the  Paris  Agreement  and  the  NDCs  could  strengthen  their  links  to  sustainable development is to update country-specific climate pledges. Countries are free to choose their targets and the means and instruments with which to implement them. A core feature of the NDCs was that countries submit NDCs every five years, giving them an opportunity to assess themselves relative to other  countries,  raise  their  ambitions  and  learn  from  their  peers.  Moreover,  it  was  emphasized  that </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1719">countries should not &#8220;backslide&#8221; in subsequent NDCs, thus ensuring that countries should always be </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1721">forward-looking in respect of increasing their ambitions to deliver the Paris Goals. H&#246;hne et al. (2017) found  that,  in  developing  countries  especially,  the  NDC  preparation  process  has  improved  national climate policy-making.  </span></div><div style="" id="id1725"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1726">Despite some favourable reviews, several assessments of specific countries</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1727">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1728"> NDCs (Andries et al. 2017; Rogelj  et  al.  2016;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016)  have  assessed  that  those  submitted  for  2020-2030  are insufficient for delivering on the Paris goals. Updated and/or new NDCs were therefore submitted by end  of  2020.  However,  an  assessment  of  those  NDCs  revealed  that  the  level  of  ambition  was significantly lower than the goals of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCO 2020; see also this Chapter). One of the urgent calls in Paris was to assess the impacts and efforts that need to be undertaken to keep global  warming  well  below  2&#176;C  in  relation  to  pre-industrial  levels  and  evaluate  related  global greenhouse-gas  emission  pathways  (UNFCCC  2015).  Although  the  initial  NDCs  fell  short  of  these goals,  the  idea  was  that  NDCs  would  be  living  documents  that  could  ratchet  up  climate  action  and ambition. </span></div><div style="" id="id1739"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1740">Countries  have  also  started  to  take  actions  on  the  SDGs  themselves  (Antwi-Agyei  et  al.  2018a; UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018). The SDGs were perceived as a novel approach to development and as establishing  a  universal  agenda  for  the  transformation  of  development  patterns  and  socioeconomic systems. At their core, the SDGs hold that building an integrated framework for action necessitates </span></div><div style="" id="id1757"/><div style="" id="id1878"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1879">addressing  the  economic,  social  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable  development  in  an integrated manner (Biermann et al. 2017; Kanie and Biermann 2017). The SDGs take multiple elements of development into account in aiming to offer coherent, well-integrated, overarching approaches to a range of sustainability challenges, including climate change. </span></div><div style="" id="id1884"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1885">One way a link is made between climate and the SDGs is through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). Paralleling the bottom-up orientation of the Paris Agreement and the NDCs, every year approximately forty  countries  voluntarily  share  their  VNRs  with  the  international  community  at  the  High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). Even more flexible than the NDCs, the VNRs can include content such as a summary of key policies and measures that are intended to achieve the SDGs, a list of the means of implementation that support the SDGs, and related challenges and needs. The VNRs also often cover SDG 13 (on climate change) as well as many other issues connected with climate change. Even with these links, implementation of the SDGs should be mentioned as part of national development processes reflecting  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1894">different  countries&#8217;  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1895">different  priorities,  visions  and  plans  (Hanson  and  Puplampu  2018; Marcotullio et al. 2018; OECD 2016; Puplampu et al. 2017; Srikanth 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id1898"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1899">Yet  another  way  that  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  underlines  the  importance  of capturing synergies is its calls for policy coherence (goals 17 and 14). Policy coherence and integration between  sectors  are  two  of  the  most  critical  factors  in  breaking  down  the  silo  mode  of  working  of different sectors. Working across climate and other sustainability agendas is essential to coherence.  </span></div><div style="" id="id1904"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1905">A final way that the sustainability and climate agendas have been linked is through vertical integration. Following a similar trend that appeared with Agenda 21, for which many cities adopted local plans, a growing number of cities have introduced Voluntary Local Reviews. The VLRs resemble the VNRs, but  place  the  emphasis  on  local  actions  and  needs  regarding  the  SDGs  (and  some  links  to  climate change)  (Ort&#237;z-Moya  et  al.  2021).  The  2019  SDG  Report  shows  that  150  countries  have  developed national  urban  plans,  almost  half  of  them  also  being  in  the  implementation  phase  (United  Nations General Assembly 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id1913"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1914">17.1.3 Integrating Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Other Policymaking </span></div><div style="" id="id1916"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1917">Processes  </span></div><div style="" id="id1919"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1920">Other non-UN-led initiatives involving international organizations or clusters of countries have also helped to raise the issue of sustainable development as a framework for mitigation. The OECD, for instance,  assesses  different  types  of  investments  and  economic  activities  with  reference  to  their significance for environmental sustainability (OECD 2020), while G20 countries have drawn up action agendas  with  sustainable  development  at  the  (UToronto  2016).  Meanwhile,  the  Petersberg  Climate Dialogue, a political movement convened by major country-group representatives launched in 2010 by the  German  government,  has  also  called  for  sustainability  to  be  an  intrinsic  part  of  the  transition (UNFCCO 2020; BMU 2018).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1929"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1930">Due in part to the shifting orientation of these international processes, there  is growing evidence of action  on  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  at  other  levels  of  decision-making.  National policies  often  aim  to  implement  climate  change  policies  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development (Chimhowu et al. 2019;  Chirambo  2018;  ECLAC  2017;  Fuseini and  Kemp 2015;  Galli  et  al.  2018; Haywood  et  al.  2019;  Ministry  of  Environment  of  Jordan  2016;  McKenzie  and  Abdulkadri  2018; UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018; UN Women 2017). Some countries are adjusting their existing policies to build on themes familiar to sustainable development (Lucas et al. 2016), including renewable energy and energy efficiency (Fastenrath and Braun 2018; Kousksou et al. 2015), urban planning (Gorissen et al. 2018; Loorbach et al. 2016; Mendizabal et al. 2018), health systems (Pencheon 2018; Roschnik et </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1940">al. 2017) and agricultural systems (Lipper and Zilberman 2018; Shaw and Roberts 2017). Cross-cutting and  integrated  approaches,  such  as  the  circular  economy,  have  also  been  gaining  traction  in  some European countries (EESC 2015) and G20 countries (Noura et al. 2020). Many of these efforts have also extended up to the regional and down to the local level (Gorissen et al. 2018; Hess 2014; Shaw and Roberts 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1956"/><div class="tree_root"><div style="" id="id167" marker="Chapter 17: Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development "><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;
