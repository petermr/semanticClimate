Global  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  continued  to  rise  to  2019:  the  aggregate  reductions 
implied  by  current  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDCs)  to  2030  would  still  make  it 
impossible to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and would only be compatible 
with  likely  limiting  warming  below  2°C  if  followed  by  much  steeper  decline,  hence  limiting 
warming to either level implies accelerated mitigation actions at all scales (robust evidence, high 
agreement). Since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), important changes that have emerged 
include the specific objectives established in the Paris Agreement of 2015 (for temperature, adaptation 
and finance), rising climate impacts, and higher levels of societal awareness and support for climate 
action.  The  growth  of  global  GHG  emissions  has  slowed  over  the  past  decade,  and  delivering  the 
updated NDCs to 2030 would turn this into decline, but the implied global emissions by 2030 exceed 
pathways consistent with 1.5°C by a large margin, and are near the upper end of the range of modelled 
pathways  which  keep  temperatures  likely  below  2°C.  Continuing  investments  in  carbon-intensive 
activities at scale will heighten the multitude of risks associated with climate change and impede societal 
and  industrial  transformation  towards  low  carbon  development.  Meeting  the  long-term  temperature 
objective  in  the  Paris  Agreement  therefore  implies  a  rapid  turn  to  an  accelerating  decline  of  GHG 
emissions towards ‘net zero’, which is implausible without urgent and ambitious action at all scales. 
The  unprecedented  COVID-19  pandemic  has  had  far-reaching  impacts  on  the  global  economic  and 
social system, and recovery will present both challenges and opportunities for climate mitigation. {1.2, 
1.3, 1.5, 1.6, Chapters 3 and 4}. 

While there are some trade-offs, effective and equitable climate policies are largely compatible 
with the broader goal of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty as enshrined in 
the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (robust evidence, high agreement). Climate mitigation 
is one of many goals that societies pursue in the context of sustainable development, as evidenced by 
the wide range of the SDGs. Climate mitigation has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs. 
There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per 
capita  and  absolute  emissions  have  risen  with  industrialisation.  However,  recent  evidence  shows 
countries  can  grow  their  economies  while  reducing  emissions.  Countries  have  different  priorities  in 
achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and 
capabilities.  Given  the  differences  in  GHG  emissions  contributions,  degree  of  vulnerabilities  and 
impacts,  as  well  as  capacities  within  and  between  nations,  equity  and  justice  are  important 
considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep 
decarbonisation. Achieving sustainable global development and eradicating poverty as enshrined in the 
17 SDGS would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale. 
Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability. 
International  co-operation  can  enhance  efforts  to  achieve  ambitious  global  climate  mitigation  in  the 
context of sustainable development. {1.4, 1.6, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 17}. 

The transition to a low carbon economy depends on a wide range of closely intertwined drivers 
and constraints, including policies and technologies where notable advances over the past decade 
have opened up new and large-scale opportunities for deep decarbonisation, and for alternative 
development  pathways  which  could  deliver  multiple  social  and  developmental  goals  (robust 
evidence,  medium  agreement).  Drivers  for  and  constraints  against  low  carbon  societal  transition 
comprise economic and technological factors (the means by which services such as food, heating and 
shelter are provided and for whom, the emissions intensity of traded products, finance, and investment), 
socio-political issues (political economy, equity and fairness, social innovation and behaviour change), 
and institutional factors (legal framework and institutions, and the quality of international cooperation). 
In addition to being deeply intertwined all the factors matter to varying degrees, depending on prevailing

social, economic, cultural and political context. They often exert both push and pull forces at the same 
time, within and across different scales. The development and deployment of innovative technologies 
and  systems  at  scale  are  important  for  achieving  deep  decarbonisation.    In  recent  years,  the  cost  of 
several  low  carbon  technologies  has  declined  sharply,  alongside  rapid  deployment.  Over  twenty 
countries have also sustained emission reductions, and many more have accelerated energy efficiency 
and/or  land-use  improvements.  Overall,  however  the  global  contribution  is  so  far  modest,  at  a  few 
billion tonnes (tCO2e) of avoided emissions annually. {1.3, 1.4, Chapters 2, 4,13,14}.  

Accelerating  mitigation  to  prevent  dangerous  anthropogenic  interference  within  the  climate 
system will require the integration of broadened assessment frameworks and tools that combine 
multiple  perspectives,  applied  in  a  context  of  multi-level  governance  (robust  evidence,  medium 
agreement). Analysing a challenge on the scale of fully decarbonising our economies entails integration 
of multiple analytic frameworks. Approaches to risk assessment and resilience, established across IPCC 
Working  Groups,  are  complemented  by  frameworks  for  probing  the  challenges  in  implementing 
mitigation. Aggregate Frameworks include cost-effectiveness analysis towards given objectives, and 
cost-benefit  analysis,  both  of  which  have  been  developing  to  take  fuller  account  of  advances  in 
understanding  risks  and  innovation,  the  dynamics  of  emitting  systems  and  of  climate  impacts,  and 
welfare economic theory including growing consensus on long-term discounting. Ethical frameworks 
consider the fairness of processes and outcomes which can help ameliorate distributional impacts across 
income  groups,  countries  and  generations.  Transition  and  transformation  frameworks  explain  and 
evaluate the dynamics of transitions to low-carbon systems arising from interactions amongst levels, 
with inevitable resistance from established socio-technical structures. Psychological, behavioural and 
political frameworks outline the constraints (and opportunities) arising from human psychology and the 
power  of  incumbent  interests.  A  comprehensive  understanding  of  climate  mitigation  must  combine 
these  multiple  frameworks.  Together  with  established  risk  frameworks,  collectively  these  help  to 
explain potential synergies and trade-offs in mitigation, imply a need for a wide portfolio of policies 
attuned to  different  actors and  levels  of  decision-making,  and  underpin ‘just transition’  strategies in 
diverse contexts. {1.2.2, 1.7, 1.8}. 

The  speed,  direction  and  depth  of  any  transition  will  be  determined  by  choices  in  the, 
environmental, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional realms (robust evidence, 
high agreement). Transitions in specific systems can be gradual or rapid and disruptive. The pace of a 
transition can be impeded by ‘lock-in’ generated by existing physical capital, institutions, and social 
norms.  The  interaction  between  power,  politics  and  economy  is  central  in  explaining  why  broad 
commitments do not always translate to urgent action. At the same time, attention to and support for 
climate policies and low carbon societal transition has generally increased, as the impacts have become 
more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and 
balance of high and low carbon investments. COVID-19 has strained public finances, and integrating 
climate  finance  into  ongoing  recovery  strategies,  nationally  and  internationally,  can  accelerate  the 
diffusion of low carbon technologies and also help poorer countries to minimise future stranded assets. 
Societal & behavioural  norms,  regulations  and  institutions  are essential  conditions  to  accelerate low 
carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major 
transition. {1.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this chapter, 1.4, 1.8, Chapters 2-4 and 15}.   

Achieving the global transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable world requires 
purposeful  and  increasingly  coordinated  planning  and  decisions  at  many  scales  of  governance 
including  local,  subnational,  national  and  global  levels  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement). 
Accelerating  mitigation  globally  would  imply  strengthening  policies  adopted  to  date,  expanding  the 
effort across options, sectors, and countries, and broadening responses to include more diverse actors 
and societal processes at multiple – including international – levels. Effective governance of climate 
change entails strong action across multiple jurisdictions and decision-making levels, including regular

evaluation and learning. Choices that cause climate change as well as the processes  for making and 
implementing relevant decisions involve a range of non-nation state actors such as cities, businesses, 
and civil society organisations. At global, national and subnational levels, climate change actions are 
interwoven with and embedded in the context of much broader social, economic and political goals.  
Therefore,  the  governance  required  to  address  climate  change  has  to  navigate  power,  political, 
economic,  and  social  dynamics  at  all  levels  of  decision  making.  Effective  climate-governing 
institutions, and openness to experimentation on a variety of institutional arrangements, policies and 
programmes can play a vital role in engaging stakeholders and building momentum for effective climate 
action. {1.4, 1.9, Chapters 8, 15, 17}.

1.1  Introduction  

This  Report  (WGIII)  aims  to  assess  new  literature  on  climate  mitigation  including  implications  for 
global  sustainable  development.  In  this  Sixth  Assessment  Cycle  the  IPCC  has  also  published  three 
Special Reports1 all of which emphasise the rising threat of  climate change and the implications  for 
more ambitious mitigation efforts at all scales. At the same time, the Paris Agreement (PA) and the UN 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), both 
adopted  in  2015,  set  out  a  globally  agreed  agenda  within  which  climate  mitigation  efforts  must  be 
located. Along with a better understanding of the physical science basis of climate change (AR6 WGI), 
and  vulnerabilities,  impacts,  and  adaptation  (AR6  WGII),  the  landscape  of  climate  mitigation  has 
evolved substantially since Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).  

Since  AR5, (IPCC 2014a) climate mitigation policies around the world have grown in both number 
and  shape  (Chapter  13).  However,  while  the  average  rate  of  annual  increase  of  CO2  emissions  has 
declined  (Section  1.3.2)  GHG  emissions  globally  continued  to  rise,  underlining  the  urgency  of  the 
mitigation  challenge  (Chapters  2,  3).  Over  twenty  countries  have  cut  absolute  emissions  alongside 
sustained  economic  growth,  but  the  scale  of  mitigation  action  across  countries  remains  varied  and 
generally much slower than the pace required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement (Section 1.3.2 
in this chapter and Section 2.7.2 in Chapter 2). Per-capita GHG emissions between countries even at 
similar stages of economic development (based on GDP per capita) vary by a factor of three (Figure 
1.6) and by more than two on consumption basis (Section 2.3 in Chapter 2).  

The  Special  Report  on  1.5oC  underlined  that  humanity  is  now  living  with  the  “unifying  lens  of  the 
Anthropocene” (SR 1.5 IPCC 2018a, 52 & 53), that requires a sharpened focus on the impact of human 
activity on the climate system and the planet more broadly given ‘planetary boundaries’ (Steffen et al. 
2015)  including  interdependencies  of  climate  change  and  biodiversity  (Dasgupta  2021).  Recent 
literature assessed by WGs I and II of this AR6 underlines the urgency of climate action as cumulative 
CO2 emissions, along with other greenhouses gases, drives the temperature change. Across AR6, global 
temperature changes are defined relative to the period 1850-1900, as in SR1.5 and collaboration with 
WGI  enabled  the  use  of  AR6-calibrated  emulators  to  assure  consistency  across  the  three  Working 
Groups.  The remaining ‘carbon budgets’ (see Annex I) associated with 1.5°C and 2°C temperature 
targets equate to about one (for 1.5°C) to three (for 2°C) decades of current emissions, as from 2020, 
but with significant variation depending on multiple factors including other gases (Figure 2.7 in Chapter

2018b);  the ‘Special Report on Climate Change and Land’ (SRCCL) (IPCC 2019c); and the ‘Special Report on 
the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate’ (SROCC) (IPCC 2019b).

2;  Cross-Working  Group Box  1  in  Chapter  3).    For an  outline  of the WGIII  approach  to mitigation 
scenarios, emission pathways implied by the Paris goals, and timing of peak and ‘net zero’ (Annex I 
and FAQ 1.3), see Section 1.5, and Chapter 3.  

Strong  differences  remain  in  responsibilities  for,  and  capabilities  to,  take  climate  action  within  and 
between countries. These differences, as well as differences in the impact of climate change, point to 
the role of collective action in achieving urgent and ambitious global climate mitigation in the context 
of  sustainable  development,  with  attention  to  issues  of  equity  and  fairness  as  highlighted  in  several 
chapters of the report (Chapters 4, 5, 14, 15, 17).  

Innovation and industrial development of key technologies in several relevant sectors have transformed 
prospects  for  mitigation  at  much  lower  cost  than  previously  assessed  (Chapters  2  and  6–12).  Large 
reductions in the cost of widely-available renewable energy technologies, along with energy efficient 
technologies and behavioural changes (Chapters 5 and 9–11), can enable societies to provide services 
with much lower emissions. However, there are still significant differences in the ability to access and 
utilise  low  carbon  technologies  across  the  world  (Chapter  4,  15,  16).  New  actors,  including  cities, 
businesses, and numerous non-state transnational alliances have emerged as important players in the 
global effort to tackle climate change (Chapters 13–16).  

Along with continued development of concepts, models and technologies, there have been numerous 
insights from both the successes and failures of mitigation action that can inform future policy design 
and climate action. However, to date, policies and investments are still clearly  inadequate to put the 
world in line with the PA’s aims (Chapters 13, 15).  

The greater the inertia  in emission trends and carbon-intensive investments, the more that CO2 will 
continue to accumulate  (Hilaire et al. 2019; IPCC 2019a). Overall, the literature  points to the need for 
a more dynamic consideration of intertwined challenges concerning the transformation of key GHG 
emitting  systems:  to  minimise  the  trade-offs,  and  maximise  the  synergies,  of  delivering  deep 
decarbonisation whilst enhancing sustainable development.  

This Chapter introduces readers to the AR6 WGIII Report and provides an overview of progress and 
challenges, in three parts. Part A, introduces the climate mitigation challenge, provides key findings 
and developments since previous assessment, and reviews the main drivers for, and constraints against 
accelerated climate action. Part B provides an assessment of the key frameworks for understanding the 
climate mitigation challenge covering broad approaches like sustainable development and more specific 
economic, political and ethical framings. Part C briefly highlights the role of governance for steering 
and coordinating efforts to accelerate globally effective and equitable climate mitigation, notes the gaps 
in knowledge that have been identified in the process of assessment and provides a road map to the rest 
of the Report. 

 

1.2   Previous Assessments  

1.2.1  Key findings from Previous Assessment Reports  

Successive WGIII IPCC Assessments have emphasised the importance of climate mitigation along with 
the need to consider broader societal goals especially sustainable development. Key insights from AR5 
and the subsequent three Special Reports (IPCC 2019b, 2018b, 2019c) are summarised below.  

AR5  projected  that  in  baseline  scenarios  (i.e.  based  on  prevailing  trends  without  explicit  additional 
mitigation  efforts),  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Other  Land  Uses  (AFOLU)  would  be  the  only  sector 
where emissions could fall by 2100, with some CO2 removal (IPCC 2014b, p. 17). Direct CO2 emissions 
from  energy  were  projected  to  double  or  even  triple  by  2050  (IPCC  2014b,  p.  20)  due  to  global

population and economic growth, resulting in global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 from 
3.7°C  to  4.8°C  compared  to  pre-industrial  levels.  AR5  noted  that  mitigation  effort  and  the  costs 
associated  with  ambitious  mitigation  differ  significantly  across  countries,  and  in  ‘globally  cost-
effective’  scenarios,  the  biggest  reductions  (relative  to  projections)  occur  in  the  countries  with  the 
highest future emissions in the baseline scenarios (IPCC 2014b, p. 17). Since most physical capital (e.g. 
power plants, buildings, transport infrastructure) involved in GHG emissions is long-lived, the timing 
of the shift in investments and strategies will be crucial (IPCC 2014b, p. 18). 

A key message from recent Special Reports is the urgency to mitigate GHG emissions in order  to avoid 
rapid and potentially irreversible changes in natural and human systems (IPCC 2019b, 2018b, 2019a). 
Successive  IPCC  reports  have  drawn  upon  increasing  sophistication  of  modelling  tools  to  project 
emissions in the absence of ambitious decarbonisation action, as well as the emission pathways that 
meet  long  term  temperature  targets.  The  SR1.5  examined  pathways  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C, 
compared to historical baseline of 1850-1900, finding that “in pathways with no or limited overshoot 
of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, 
reaching net zero around 2050” (2045–2055 interquartile range); with ‘overshoot’ referring to higher 
temperatures, then brought down by 2100 through ‘net negative’ emissions.  It found this would require 
rapid  and  far-reaching  transitions  in  energy,  land,  urban  and  infrastructure  (including  transport  and 
buildings), and industrial systems (high confidence) (IPCC 2018b).  

SR1.5  found  that  the  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDCs)  as  declared  under  the  Paris 
Agreement (PA) would not limit warming to 1.5 C; despite significant updates to NDCs in 2020/21, 
this  remains  the  case  though  delivery  of  these  more  ambition  NDCs  would  somewhat  enhance  the 
prospects for staying below 2°C (Section 1.3.3).  

AR5  WGIII  and  the  Special  Reports  analysed  economic  costs  associated  with  climate  action.  The 
estimates  vary  widely  depending  on  the  assumptions  made  as  to  how  ordered  the  transition  is, 
temperature  target,  technology  availability,  the  metric  or  model  used,  among  others  (Chapter  6). 
Modelled direct mitigation costs of pathways to 1.5°C, with no/limited overshoot, span a wide range, 
but were typically 3-4 times higher than in pathways to 2°C (high confidence), before taking account 
of benefits, including significant reduction in loss of life and livelihoods, and avoided climate impacts 
(IPCC 2018b). 

Successive  IPCC  Reports  highlight  a  strong  connection  between  climate  mitigation  and  sustainable 
development.  Climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  goals  have  synergies  and  trade-offs  with  efforts  to 
achieve  sustainable  development,  including  poverty  eradication.  A  comprehensive  assessment  of 
climate policy therefore involves going beyond a narrow focus on specific mitigation and adaptation 
options  to  incorporate  climate  issues  into  the  design  of  comprehensive  strategies  for  equitable 
sustainable  development.  At  the  same  time,  some  climate  mitigation  policies  can  run  counter  to 
sustainable  development  and  eradicating  poverty,  which  highlights  the  need  to  consider  trade-offs 
alongside  benefits.  Examples  include  synergies  between  climate  policy  and  improved  air  quality, 
reducing premature deaths and morbidity (IPCC 2014b Fig SPM.6; AR6 WG1 sections 6.6.3 and 6.7.3), 
but  there  would  be  trade-offs  if  policy  raises  net  energy  bills,  with  distributional  implications.  The 
Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) also emphasises important synergies and trade-
offs, bringing new light on the link between healthy and sustainable food consumption and emissions 
caused by the agricultural sector. Land-related responses that contribute to climate change adaptation 
and mitigation can also combat desertification and land degradation and enhance food security (IPCC 
2019a).  

Previous ARs have detailed the contribution of various sectors and activities to global GHG emissions. 
When indirect emissions (mainly from electricity, heat and other energy conversions) are included, the 
four  main  consumption  (end-use)  drivers  are  industry,  AFOLU,  buildings  and  transport (Chapter  2,

Figure  2.14),  though  the  magnitude  of  these  emissions  can  vary  widely  between  countries.  These  – 
together with the energy and urban systems which feed and shape end-use sectors – define the sectoral 
chapters in this AR6 WGIII report. 

Estimates of emissions associated with production and transport of internationally traded goods were 
first presented in AR5 WGIII, which estimated the ‘embodied emission transfers’ from upper-middle-
income countries to industrialised countries through trade at about 10 percent of CO2 emissions in each 
of these groups (IPCC 2014a Fig TS.5). The literature on this and discussion on their accounting has 
grown substantially since then (Chapters 2 & 8).  

The  atmosphere  is  a  shared  global  resource  and  an  integral  part  of  the  “global  commons”.  In  the 
depletion/restoration  of  this  resource,  myriad  actors  at  various  scales  are  involved,  for  instance, 
individuals,  communities,  firms  and  states.  Inter  alia,  international  cooperation  to  tackle  ozone 
depletion  and  acid  rain  offer  useful  examples.  AR5  noted  that  greater  cooperation  would  ensue  if 
policies  are  perceived  as  fair  and  equitable  by  all  countries  along  the  spectrum  of  economic 
development–implying  a  need for  equitable  sharing of  the  effort.  A  key takeaway  from  AR5 is that 
climate policy involves value judgement and ethics. (IPCC 2014a Box TS.1 “People and countries have 
rights and owe duties towards each other. These are matters of justice, equity, or fairness. They fall 
within  the  subject  matter  of  moral  and  political  philosophy,  jurisprudence,  and  economics.”  p.  37). 
International cooperation and collective action on climate change alongside local, national, regional and 
global policies will be crucial to solve the problem, and this report notes cooperative approaches beyond 
simple ‘global commons’ framings (Chapters 13, 14). 

AR5  (all  Working  Group  Reports)  also  underlined  that  climate  policy  inherently  involves  risk  and 
uncertainty (in nature, economy, society and individuals). To help evaluate responses, there exists a rich 
suite of analytical tools, for example, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria 
analysis, expected utility theory and catastrophe and risk models. All have pros and cons, and have been 
further developed in subsequent literature and AR6 (next section).  

Recent Assessments (IPCC 2014a, 2018b) began to consider the role of individual behavioural choices 
and cultural norms in driving energy and food patterns. Notably, SR1.5 (Section 4.4.3 in Chapter 4) 
outlined emerging evidence on the potential for changes in behaviour, lifestyle and culture to contribute 
to decarbonisation (and lower the cost); for the first time, AR6 devotes a whole chapter (Chapter 5) to 
consider these and other underlying drivers of energy demand, food choices and social aspects.  

1.2.2  Developments in Climate Science, Impacts and Risk  

The assessment of the Physical Science Basis (IPCC WGI AR6) documents sustained and widespread 
changes in the atmosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean, providing unequivocal evidence of a world 
that has warmed, associated with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations reaching levels not experienced 
in at least the last 2 million years. Aside from temperature, other clearly discernible, human-induced 
changes  beyond  natural  variations  include  declines  in  Arctic  Sea  ice  and  glaciers,  thawing  of 
permafrost,  and  a  strengthening  of  the  global  water  cycle  (WG1  SPM  A.2,  B.3  and  B.4).  Oceanic 
changes include rising sea level, acidification, deoxygenation, and changing salinity (WG1 SPM B.3). 
Over land, in recent decades, both frequency and severity have increased for hot extremes but decreased 
for  cold  extremes;  intensification  of  heavy  precipitation  is  observed  in  parallel  with  a  decrease  in 
available water in dry seasons, along with an increased occurrence of weather conditions that promote 
wildfires. 

In  defining  the  objective  of  international  climate  negotiations  as  being  to  ‘prevent  dangerous 
anthropogenic interference’ (Article 2 UNFCCC 1992), the UNFCCC underlines the centrality of risk 
framing  in  considering  the  threats  of  climate  change  and  potential  response  measures.  Against  the 
background  of  ‘unequivocal’  (AR4)  evidence  of  human-induced  climate  change,  and  the  growing

experience  of  direct impacts, the  IPCC  has sought to  systematise  a  robust  approach to  risk and risk 
management.  

In  AR6  the  IPCC  employs  a  common  risk  framing  across  all  three  working  groups  and  provides 
guidance for more consistent and transparent usage (AR6 WGI Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1; AR6 
WGII  1.4.1;  IPCC  risk  guidance).  AR6  defines  risk  as  “the  potential  for  adverse  consequences  for 
human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such 
systems”  (Annex  I),  encompassing  risks  from  both  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  and  human 
responses to it (Reisinger et al. 2020).  The risk framing includes steps for identifying, evaluating, and 
prioritising current and future risks; for understanding the interactions among different sources of risk; 
for  distributing  effort  and equitable  sharing of risks; for monitoring  and  adjusting  actions  over time 
while continuing to assess changing circumstances; and for communications among analysts, decision-
makers, and the public. 

Climate change risk assessments face challenges including a tendency to mis-characterise risks and pay 
insufficient attention to the potential for surprises (Weitzman 2011; Aven and Renn 2015; Stoerk et al. 
2018).  Concepts  of  resilience  and  vulnerability  provide  overlapping,  alternative  entry  points  to 
understanding and addressing the societal challenges caused and exacerbated by climate change (AR6, 
WGII, Chapter 1.2.1).  

AR6 WGII devotes a full chapter (17) to ‘Decision-Making Options for Managing Risk’, detailing the 
analytic approaches and drawing upon the Cynefin classification of Known, Knowable, Complex and 
Chaotic  systems  (17.3.1).  With  deep  uncertainty,  risk  management  often  aims  to  identify  specific 
combinations  of  response actions and  enabling  institutions  that increase  the  potential for favourable 
outcomes  despite  irreducible  uncertainties  (AR6  WGII  Chapter  17  Cross-Chapter  Box  DEEP;  also  
(Marchau et al. 2019; Doukas and Nikas 2020). 

Literature  trying  to  quantify  the  cost  of  climate  damages  has  continued  to  develop.  Different 
methodologies systematically affect outcomes, with recent estimates based on empirical approaches – 
econometric measurements based on actual impacts – ‘categorically higher than estimates from other 
approaches’ (Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC in WGII Chapter 16, Section 16.6.2). This, along 
with other developments strengthen foundations for calculating a ‘social cost of carbon’. This informs 
a common metric for comparing different risks and estimating benefits compared to the costs of GHG 
reductions  and  other  risk-reducing  options  (Section  1.7.1);  emissions  mitigation  itself  also  involves 
multiple uncertainties, which alongside risks can also involve potential opportunities (Section 1.7.3).  

Simultaneously,  the  literature  increasingly  emphasises  the  importance  of  multi-objective  risk 
assessment and management (e.g., representative key risks in WGII Chapter 16), which may or may 
not correlate with any single estimate of economic value (AR6 WGII 1.4.1; IPCC risk guidance). Given 
the deep uncertainties and risks, the goals established (notably in the Paris Agreement and SDGs) reflect 
negotiated outcomes informed by the scientific assessment of risks.  

 

1.3   The Multilateral Context, Emission Trends and Key Developments 

Since AR5, there have been notable multilateral efforts which help determine the context for current 
and future climate action. This section summarises key features of this evolving context. 

1.3.1  The 2015 Agreements  

In  2015  the  world  concluded  four  major  agreements  that  are  very  relevant  to  climate  action.  These 
include:  the  Paris  Agreement  under  the  1992  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate

                             IPCC AR6 WGIII 

 

Change  (UNFCCC),  the  UN  agreements  on  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  (Sendai)  and  Finance  for 
Development (Addis Ababa), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   

The  Paris  Agreement  (PA).  The  Paris  Agreement  aims  to  “hold  the  increase in  the  global  average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels” (UNFCCC 2015), alongside goals for adaptation (IPCC 
WGII), and ‘aligning financial flows’ (below) , so as “to strengthen the global response to the threat of 
climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”   

The  Paris  Agreement  is  predicated  on  encouraging  progressively  ambitious  climate  action  from  all 
countries on the basis of Nationally Determined Contributions (Rajamani 2016; Clémençon 2016).  The 
NDC approach requires countries to set their own level of ambitions for climate change mitigation but 
within a collaborative and legally binding process to foster ambition towards the agreed goals (Falkner 
2016a; Bodansky 2016). The PA entered into force in November 2016 and as of February 2021 it has 
190 Parties (out of 197 Parties to the UNFCCC).  

The  PA  also  underlines  “the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective 
capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances” (PA Article 2 para 2), and correspondingly 
that “developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute 
emission  reductions”.  It  states  that  developing  country  Parties  should  continue  enhancing  their 
mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or 
limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.  

The Paris Agreement’s mitigation goal implies “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions 
by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century” (PA Article 4 
para 1). The Paris Agreement provides for 5-yearly stocktakes in which Parties have to take collective 
stock  on  progress  towards  achieving  its  purposes  and  its  long-term  goal  in  the  light  of  equity  and 
available best science (PA Article 14). The first global stocktake is scheduled for 2023. (PA Article 14 
para 3). 

The Paris Agreement aims to make ‘finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse 
gas emissions and climate-resilient development’ (PA Article 2.1C). In keeping with the acknowledged 
context  of  global  sustainable  development  and  poverty  eradication,  and  the  corresponding  aims  of 
aligning  finance  and  agreed  differentiating  principles  as  indicated  above,  “…the  developed  country 
parties  are  to  assist  developing  country  parties  with  financial  resources”  (PA  Article  9).  The  Green 
Climate Fund (GCF), an operating entity of the UNFCCC Financial Mechanism to finance mitigation 
and adaptation efforts in developing countries (GCF 2020),  was given an important role in serving the 
Agreement  and  supporting  PA  goals..  The  GCF  gathered  pledges  worth  USD  10.3  billion,  from 
developed and developing countries, regions, and one city (Paris) (Antimiani et al. 2017; Bowman and 
Minas 2019). Financing has since increased but remains short of the goal to mobilise USD100 billion 
by 2020 (Chapter 15).  

Initiatives  contributing  to  the  Paris  Agreement  goals  include  the  Non-State  Actor  Zone  for  Climate 
Action (NAZCA or now renamed as  Global Climate Action) portal, launched at COP20 (December 
2014)  in  Lima,  Peru,  to  support  city-based  actions  for  mitigating  climate  change  (Mead  2015)  and 
Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action which is a UNFCCC-backed series of events intended 
to facilitate collaboration between governments and the cities, regions, businesses and investors that 
must act on climate change. 

Details  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  evaluation  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  and  other  key  multilateral 
developments  since  AR5  relevant  to  climate  mitigation  including  the  CORSIA  aviation  agreement 
adopted under ICAO, the IMO shipping strategy, and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
on HFCs, are discussed in Chapter 14.

SDGs. In September 2015, the UN endorsed a universal agenda – ‘Transforming our World: the 2030 
Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development’.  The  agenda  adopted  17  non-legally-binding  SDGs  and  169 
targets  to  support  people,  peace,  prosperity,  partnerships  and  the  planet.  While  climate  change  is 
explicitly listed as SDG13, the pursuit of the implementation of the UNFCCC is relevant for a number 
of  other  goals  including  SDG  7  (clean  energy  for  all),  9  (sustainable  industry),  and  11  (sustainable 
cities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) as well as those relating to life below water (14) 
and on land (15) (Biermann et al. 2017). Mitigation actions could have multiple synergies and trade-
offs across the SDGs (Chapter 17; Pradhan et al. 2017) and their net effects depend on the pace and 
magnitude  of  changes,  the    specific  mitigation  choices  and  the  management  of  the  transition.  This 
suggests that mitigation must be pursued in the broader context of sustainable development as explained 
in Section 1.6 

Finance. The Paris Agreement’s finance goal (above) reflects a broadened focus, beyond the costs of 
climate adaptation  and  mitigation,  to  recognising that  a  structural  shift  towards low  carbon climate-
resilient development pathways requires large scale investments that engage the wider financial system 
(15.1 and 15.2.4). The SR1.5C report estimated that 1.5oC pathways would require increased investment 
of 0.5-1% of global GDP between now and 2050, which is up to 2.5% of global savings / investment 
over the period. For low- and middle-income countries, SDG-compatible infrastructure investments in 
the most relevant sectors are estimated to be around 4-5% of their GDP, and ‘infrastructure investment 
paths compatible with full decarbonisation in the second half of the century need not cost more than 
more-polluting alternatives’ (Rozenberg and Fay 2019). 

The parallel 2015 UN Addis Ababa Conference on Finance for Development, and its resulting Action 
Agenda,  aims  to  ‘address  the  challenge  of  financing  …  to  end  poverty  and  hunger,  and  to  achieve 
sustainable  development  in  its  three  dimensions  through  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth, 
protecting the environment, and promoting social inclusion.’  The Conference recognises the significant 
potential  of  regional  co-operation  and  provides  a  forum  for  discussing  the  solutions  to  common 
challenges faced by developing countries (15.6.4).  

Alongside  this,  private  and  blended  climate  finance  is  increasing  but  is  still  short  of  projected 
requirements consistent with Paris Agreement goals (15.3.2.1). The financing gap is particularly acute 
for  adaptation  projects,  especially  in  vulnerable  developing  countries.  From  a  macro-regulatory 
perspective, there is growing recognition that substantial financial value may be at risk from changing 
regulation and technology in a low-carbon transition, with potential implications for global financial 
stability  (15.6.3).  To  date,  the  most  significant  governance  development  is  the  Financial  Stability 
Board’s  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosure  (TCFD)  and  its  recommendations  that 
investors  and  companies  consider  climate  change  risks  in  their  strategies  and  capital  allocation,  so 
investors can make informed decisions (TCFD 2018), welcomed by over 500 financial institutions and 
companies as signatories, albeit with patchy implementation (1.4. 4; 15.6.3).  

Talanoa  Dialogue  and  Just  Transition.  As  mandated  at  Paris  COP21  and  launched  at  COP23,  the 
‘Talanoa  Dialogue’  (UNFCCC  2018a)  emphasised  holistic  approaches  across  multiple  economic 
sectors for climate change mitigation. At COP24 also, the Just Transition Silesia Declaration, focusing 
on the need to consider social aspects in designing policies for climate change mitigation was signed 
by 56 heads of state (UNFCCC 2018b). This underlined the importance of aiming for a ‘just transition’ 
in terms of reducing emissions, at the same time preserving livelihoods and managing economic risks 
for  countries  and  communities  that  rely  heavily  on  emissions-intensive  technologies  for  domestic 
growth (Markkanen and Anger-Kraavi 2019), and for maintaining ecosystem integrity through nature-
based solutions.

Global GHG emissions have continued to rise since AR5, though  the average rate of emissions growth 
slowed,  from  2.4%  (from  2000-2010)  to  1.3%  for  2010-2019  (Figure  1.1).  After  a  period  of 
exceptionally rapid growth from 2000 as charted in AR5, global fossil-fuel- and industry-related (FFI) 
CO2  emissions  almost  plateaued  between  2014  and  2016  (while  the  global  economy  continued  to 
expand (World Bank 2020), but increased again over 2017-19, the average annual growth rate for all 
GHGs  since  2014  being  around  0.8%%  yr-1  (IPCC/EDGAR  emissions  database).  Important  driving 
factors include population and GDP growth, as illustrated in panels (b) and (c) respectively. The pause 
in  emissions  growth  reflected  interplay  of  strong  energy  efficiency  improvements  and  low-carbon 
technology  deployment,  but  these  did  not  expand  fast  enough  to  offset  the  continued  pressures  for 
overall growth at global level (UNEP 2018a; IEA 2019a). However, since 2013/14, the decline in global 
emissions intensity (GHG/GDP) has accelerated somewhat, and global emissions growth has averaged 
slightly slower than population growth (Figure 1.1d), which if sustained would imply a peak of global 
CO2 (GHG) emissions per-capita, at about 5tCO2/person (/7tCO2e/person) respectively.

Due to its much shorter lifetime, methane has disproportionate impact on near-term temperature, and is 
estimated to account for almost a third of the warming observed to date (AR6 WG1 SPM; WG-III Chapter 
2, Figure 2.4). Methane reductions could be particularly important in relation to near- and medium-term 
temperatures, including through counteracting the impact of reducing short-lived aerosol pollutants which 
have an average cooling effect.2 

The land-use component of CO2 emissions has different drivers and particularly large uncertainties (Chapter 
2,  Figures  2.2,  2.5), hence is  shown  separately.  Also, compared  to  AR5,  new  evidence showed  that the 
AFOLU CO2 estimates by the global models assessed in this report are not necessarily comparable with 
national GHG inventories, due to different approaches to estimate the 'anthropogenic' CO2 sink. Possible 
ways to reconcile these discrepancies are discussed in Chapter 7. 

Regional trends have varied. Emissions from most countries continued to grow, but in absolute terms, 32 
countries reduced energy-and-industry-CO2 emissions for at least a decade, and 24 reduced overall GHG 
(CO2-eq) emissions over the same period, but only half of them by more than 10% over the period in each 
case (Chapter 2).3 In total, developed country emissions barely changed from 2010, whilst those from the 
rest of the world grew.  

Figure 1.2 shows the distribution of regional CO2 (GHG emissions) (a) per capita and (b) per GDP based 
on purchasing power parity (GDPppp) of different country groupings in 2019. Plotted against population and 
GDP  respectively,  the  area  of  each  block  is  proportional  to  the  region’s  emissions.  Compared  to  the 
equivalent  presentations  in  2004  (AR4,  SPM.3)  and  2010  (AR5,  Figure  1.8),  East  Asia  now  forms 
substantially the biggest group, whilst at about 8(/10tCO2eq) per person, its emissions per-capita remain 
about half that of north America. In contrast, a third of the world’s population, in southern Asia and Africa, 
emit on average under 2 (2.5tCO2eq) per person, little more than in the previous Assessments. Particularly 
for these regions there continue to be substantial differences in the GDP, life expectancy and other measures 
of wellbeing (see Figure 1.6). 

 

FOOTNOTE2 Indeed, cooling effects of anthropogenic aerosols (organic carbon, black carbon, sulphates, nitrates), 
which are also important components of local air pollution (Myhre et al. 2013; WGI SPM D1.7) may in global average 
be of similar magnitude to warming from methane at present. Mitigation which reduces such aerosol masking could 
thereby  increase  global  temperatures,  and  reducing  methane  emissions  would  offset  this  much  more  rapidly  than 
reducing CO2 because of its relatively short lifetime, with the combined effects which could counterbalance each other 
(WGI  SPM  D1.7).    Methane  is  thus  particularly  important  in  determining  whether  or  when  1.5C  is  reached  for 
example. 
 
FOOTNOTE 3 With some exclusions for countries which were very small or undergoing economic collapse: Energy- 
and Industry-CO2 emissions in 2018 were below 2010 levels in 32 developed countries, but only in 24 when including 
other GHGs. Reductions were by less than 10% in half these countries. Data from Chapter 2: see (2.2.3) and Figure 
2.11 for panel of  countries  that  have  sustained  territorial  emission  reductions  longer  than  10 years,  as  analysed  in 
Lamb et al. (2021), and decomposition analysis of national trends in Xia et al. (2021). The previously rising trend of 
‘outsourced/embodied  emissions’  associated  with  goods  imported  into  developed  countries  peaked  in  2006,  but 
detailed data on this are only available EEI-CO2, to 2018 (Section 2.3 in Chapter 2). See Chapter 3 for reduction rates 
associated with 1.5 and 2°C.

Emissions  per  unit  GDP  are  much  less  diverse  than  per-capita,  and  have  also  converged  significantly. 
Poorer countries tend to show higher energy/ emissions per unit GDP partly because of higher reliance on 
basic industries, and this remains the case, though in general their energy/GDP has declined faster. 

Many developed country regions are net importers of energy-intensive goods, and emissions are affected 
by the accounting of such ‘embodied emissions’. Panels (c) and (d) show results (only available for CO2, 
to 2018) on the basis of consumption-footprints which include emissions embodied in traded goods. This 
makes modest changes to the relative position of different regions (for further discussion see Chapter 2). 

 

Figure 1.1: Distribution of regional GHG emissions for 10 broad global regions according to territorial 
accounting (panels a & b, GHG emissions) and consumption-based accounting (panels c & d, CO2-FFI 

emissions only). 

 GHG emissions are categorised into: Fossil fuel and industry (CO2-FFI), Land use, land use change, forestry 

(CO2-LULUCF) and other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, Fgas - converted to 100-year global 
warming potentials). Per-capita GHGs for territorial (panel a) and CO2-FFI emissions vs population for 
consumption-based accounting (panel c).  Panels b & d: GHG emissions per unit GDPppp vs GDPppp, 
weighted with purchasing power parity for territorial accounting (panel b), CO2-FFI emissions per unit 

GDPppp for consumption-based accounting (panel d).  The area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions 
for each regional category, with the height capturing per-capita emissions (panels a and c) or emissions per 
unit GDPppp (panels b and d), and the width proportional to the population of the regions and GDPppp. 
Emissions from international aviation and shipping (2.4% of the total GHG emissions) are not included.

While extreme poverty has fallen in more than half of the world’s economies in recent years, nearly one-
fifth of countries faced poverty rates above 30% in 2015 (below USD1.90 a day), reflecting large income 
inequality (Laborde Debucquet and Martin 2017; Rozenberg and Fay 2019). Diffenbaugh and Burke (2019) 
find  that  global  warming  already  has  increased  global  economic  inequality,  even  if  between-country 
inequalities have decreased over recent decade.   The distributional implications between regional groups 
of different in the ‘shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)’ diverge according to the scenario (Frame et al. 
2019).  

An important recent development has been commitments by many countries, now covering a large majority 
of global emissions, to reach net zero CO2 or greenhouse gas emissions (Chapter 3).4 Furthermore, globally, 
net zero targets (whether CO2 or GHG) have been adopted by about 823 cities and 101 regions (Chapter 8).  

1.3.3  Some Other Key Trends and Developments  

The  COVID-19  pandemic  profoundly  impacted  economy  and  human  society,  globally  and  within 
countries. As detailed in Cross-Chapter Box 1, some of its impacts will be long lasting, permanent even, 
and there are also lessons relevant to climate change. The direct impact on emissions projected for rest of 
this  decade  are  modest,  but  the  necessity  for  economic  recovery  packages  creates  a  central  role  for 
government-led investment, and may change the economic fundamentals involved for some years to come.  

The COVID-19 aftermath consequently also changes the economic context for mitigation (Sections 15.2 
and 15.4 in Chapter 15). Many traditional forms of economic analysis (expressed as general equilibrium) 
assume that available economic resources are fully employed, with limited scope for beneficial economic 
‘multiplier effects’ of government-led investment. After COVID-19 however, no country is in this state. 
Very  low  interest  rates  amplify  opportunities  for  large-scale  investments  which  could  bring  ‘economic 
multiplier’  benefits,  especially  if  they  help  to  build  the  industries  and  infrastructures  for  further  clean 
growth (Hepburn et al. 2020). However, the capability to mobilise low interest finance vary markedly across 
countries and large public debts - including bringing some developing countries close to default - undermine 
both the political appetite and feasibility of large-scale clean investments.  In practice the current orientation 
of  COVID-19  recovery  packages  is  very  varied,  pointing  to  a  very  mixed  picture  about  whether  or  not 
countries are exploiting this opportunity (Cross-Chapter Box 1).

The  COVID-19  pandemic  triggered  the  deepest  global  economic  contraction  as  well  as  CO2  emission 
reductions since the Second World War (Section 2.2.2.1 in Chapter 2; AR6 WGI Box 6.1 in Chapter 6)  (Le 
Quéré et al. 2020b;). While emissions and most economies are expected to rebound in 2021-2022 (IEA 
2021),  some  impacts  of  the  pandemic  (eg.  aspects  of  economy,  finance  and  transport-related  emission

drivers) may last far longer. COVID-19 pushed more than 100 million people back into extreme poverty, 
and reversed progress towards some other SDGs including health, life expectancy and child literacy (UN 
DESA 2021). Health impacts and the consequences of deep economy-wide shocks may last many years 
even without significant future recurrence (Section 15.6.3 in Chapter 15). These changes, as well as the 
pandemic response actions, bring both important risks as well as opportunities for accelerating mitigation 
(Chapters 1, 5, 10 and 15).  

Lessons.  Important  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  the  pandemic  to  climate  change  including  the  value  of 
forward-looking risk management, the role of scientific assessment, preparatory action and international 
process and institutions (1.3, Chapter 5). There had been long-standing warnings of pandemic risks, and 
precursors – with both pandemic and climate risks being identified by social scientists as ‘uncomfortable 
knowledge’,  or  ‘unknown  knowns’  which  tend  to  be  marginalised  in  practical  policy  (Rayner  2012; 
Sarewitz 2020). This echoes long-standing climate literature on potential ‘high impact’ events, including 
those perceived as low probability (Dietz 2011; Weitzman 2011). The costs of preparatory action, mainly 
in those countries that had suffered from earlier pandemics were negligible in comparison, suggesting the 
importance not just of knowledge but its effective communication and embodiment in society (Chapter 5). 
(Klenert et al. 2020) offer five early lessons for climate policy, concerning: the cost of delay; the bias in 
human judgement; the inequality of impacts; the need for multiple forms of international cooperation; and 
finally, ‘transparency in value judgements at the science-policy interface’.  

Emissions and behavioural changes. Overall, global CO2 FFI emissions declined by about 5.8% (5.1% to 
6.3%) from 2019 to 2020, or about 2.2 (1.8-2.4) GtCO2 in total (Section 2.2.2 in Chapter 2). Analysis from 
previous economic crises suggest significant rebound in emissions without policy-induced structural shifts 
(2.2.2.1;  Figure  2.5)  (Jaeger  et  al.  2020).  Initial  projections  suggest  the  COVID  aftermath  may  reduce 
emissions by  4-5% over  2025  -  2030  (Shan  and  Et.al  2020;  Reilly  et  al.  2021),  below  a  ‘no-pandemic’ 
baseline The long-term impacts on behaviour, technology and associated emissions remain to be seen, but 
may be particularly significant in transport - lockdowns reduced mobility-related emissions, alongside two 
major  growth  areas:  electronic  communications  replacing  many  work  and  personal  travel  requirements 
(Section 4.4.3.4 in Chapter 4 and Chapter 10); and, revitalised local active transport and e-micromobility 
(Earley  and  Newman  2021).  Temporary  ‘clear  skies’  may  also  have  raised  awareness  of  the  potential 
environment and health co-benefits of reduced fossil fuel use particularly in urban areas  (Section 8.7 in 
Chapter 8), with evidence also indicating that air pollution itself amplified vulnerability to COVID-19 (Wu 
et al. 2020; Gudka et al. 2020). The significant impacts on passenger aviation are projected to extend not 
just through behavioural changes, but also fleet changes from retiring older planes, and reduced new orders 
indicating  expectations  of  reduced  demand  and  associated  GHG  emissions  until  2030  (Section  5.1.2  in 
Chapter  5  and  Section  10.5  in  Chapter  10;  AR6  WGI  Box  6.1  in  Chapter  6).  However,  air  cargo  has 
recovered more rapidly (IATA 2020), possibly enhanced by online ordering.  

Fiscal, growth and inequality impacts. Aspects of the global and regional economic crises from COVID-
19 may prevail much longer than the crisis itself, potentially compromising mitigation. Most countries have 
undertaken  unprecedented  levels  of  short-term  public  expenditures.  The  IMF  projects  sovereign  debt  to 
GDP to have increased by 20% in advanced economies and 10% in emerging economies by the end of 2021  
(IMF 2020). This is likely to slow economic growth, and may squeeze financial resources for mitigation 
and relevant investments for many years to come (15.2.3, 15.6.3). COVID-19 further lowered interest rates 
which  should  facilitate  low  carbon  investment,  but  pandemic  responses  have  increased  sovereign  debt 
across  countries  in  all  income  bands  (IMF  2021),  and  particularly  in  some  developing  economies  and 
regions has caused debt distress (Bulow et al. 2021) widening the gap in developing countries’ access to

capital (Hourcade et al. 2021b)  (Section 15.6.3 in Chapter 15).  After decades of global progress in reducing 
poverty, COVID-19 has pushed hundreds of millions of people below poverty thresholds and raises the 
spectre of intersecting health and climate crises that are devastating for the most vulnerable (5.1.2 Box 5.1). 
Like  those  of climate  change,  pandemic  impacts  fall  heavily  on  disadvantaged  groups,  exacerbate  the 
uneven  distribution  of  future  benefits,  amplify  existing  inequities,  and  introduce  new ones.   Increased 
poverty also hinders efforts towards sustainable low-carbon transitions (1.6).  

Impacts  on  profitability  and  investment.  COVID-19-induced  demand  reduction  in  electricity 
disproportionally affected coal power plants, whilst transport reduction most affected oil (IEA 2020a). This 
accelerated pre-existing decline in the relative profitability of most fossil fuel industries  (Ameli et al. 2021) 
Renewables were the only energy sector to increase output  (IEA 2020a).  Within the context of a wider 
overall  reduction  in  energy  investment  this  prompted  a  substantial  relative  shift  towards  low  carbon 
investment particularly by the private sector (IEA 2020b; Rosembloom and Markard 2020; 15.2.1, 15.3.1, 
15.6.1).  

Post-pandemic  recovery  pathways  provide  an  opportunity  to  attract  finance  into  accelerated  and 
transformative low-carbon public investment (15.2, 15.6.3). In most countries, COVID-19 has increased 
unemployment  and/or  state-supported  employment.  There  is  a  profound  difference  between  short-term 
‘bail-outs’ to stem unemployment, and the orientation of new public investment. The public debt is mirrored 
by large pools of private capital. During deep crises like that of the COVID-19, economic multipliers of 
stimulus packages can be high (Hepburn et al., 2020), so much so that fiscal injections can then generate 
multipliers from 1.5 to 2.5, weakening the alleged crowding-out effect of public stimulus   (Auerbach and 
Gorodnichenko 2012; Blanchard and Leigh 2013; Section 15.2.3 in Chapter 15).  

Recovery  packages  are  motivated  by  assessments  that  investing  in  can  boost  the  macroeconomic 
effectiveness  (‘multipliers’)  of  public  spending,  crowd-in  and  revive  private  investment  (Hepburn  et  al. 
2020). There are clear reasons why a low-carbon response can create more enduring jobs, better aligned to 
future growth sectors: by also crowding-in and reviving private investment (e.g. from capital markets and 
institutional investors, including the growing profile of Environment and Social Governance (ESG) and 
green  bond  markets  (15.6)),  this  can  boost  the  effectiveness  of  public  spending  (IMF  2020).  Stern  and 
Valero  (Stern  and  Valero  2021)  argue  that  investment  in  low-carbon  innovation  and  its  diffusion, 
complemented by investments in sustainable infrastructure, are key to shape environmentally sustainable 
and inclusive growth in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. This would be the case both for 
high-income  economies  on  the  global  innovation  frontier,  and  to  promote  sustainable  development  in 
poorer economies.  

A  study  with  a  global  general  equilibrium  model  (Liu  et  al.  2021)finds  that  because  the  COVID-19 
economic aftermath combines negative impacts on employment and consumption, a shift from employment 
and consumption taxes to carbon or other resource- related taxes would enhance GDP by 1.7% in 2021 
relative to ‘no policy’, in addition to reducing CO2 and other pollutants. A post-Keynesian model of wider 
‘green recovery’ policies (Pollitt et al. 2021) finds a short-run benefit of around 3.5% GDP (compared to 
‘no  policy’),  and  even  c.  1%  above  a  recovery  boosted  by  cuts  in  consumption  taxes,  the  latter  benefit 
sustained through 2030 - outperforming an equivalent conventional stimulus package while reducing global 
CO2 emissions by 12%. 

Orientation of recovery packages. The large public spending on supporting or stimulating economies, 
exceeding USD12tn by October 2020, dwarfs clean energy investment needs and hence could either help 
to solve the combined crises, or result in high-carbon lock-in (Andrijevic et al. 2020). The short-term ‘bail-

outs’ to date do not foster climate resilient long-term investments and have not been much linked to climate 
action, (Sections 15.2.3 and 15.6.3 in Chapter 15):  in the G20 counties, 40% of energy-related support 
spending went to the fossil fuel industry compared to 37% on low-carbon energy (EPT 2020). Recovery 
packages are also at risk of being ‘colourless’ (Hepburn et al., 2020) though some countries and regions 
have prioritised green stimulus expenditures for example as part of ‘Green New Deal’ (Rochedo et al. 2021; 
Section 13.9.6 in Chapter 13 and Section 15.6.3 in Chapter 15). 

Integrating  analyses.  The  response  to  COVID-19  also  reflects  the  relevance  of  combining  multiple 
analytic  frameworks  spanning  economic  efficiency,  ethics  and  equity,  transformation  dynamics,  and 
psychological and political analyses (Section 1.7). As with climate impacts, not only has the global burden 
of disease been distributed unevenly, but capabilities to prevent and treat disease were asymmetrical and 
those in greatest vulnerability often had the least access to human, physical, and financial resources (Ruger 
and  Horton  2020).   ‘Green’  versus  ‘brown’  recovery  has  corresponding  distributional  consequences 
between  these  and  ‘green’  producers,  suggesting  need  for  differentiated  policies  with  international 
coordination  (Le  Billon  et  al.  2021).  This  illustrates  the  role  of  ‘just  transition’  approaches  to  global 
responses including the value of integrated, multi-level governance (Section 1.7 in this Chapter, Section 
4.5 in Chapter 4 and Section 17.1 in Chapter 17). 

Crises  and  opportunities:  the  wider  context  for  mitigation  and  transformation.    The  impacts  of 
COVID-19 have been devastating in many ways, in many countries, and may distract political and financial 
capacity away from efforts to mitigate climate change. Yet, studies of previous post-shock periods suggest 
that waves of innovation that are ready to emerge can be accelerated by crises, which may prompt new 
behaviours, weaken incumbent (‘meso-level’) systems, and prompt rapid reforms (Section 1.6.5; Roberts 
and Geels 2019a). Lessons from the collective effort to 'flatten the curve’ during the pandemic, illustrating 
aspects  of  science-society  interactions  for  public  health  in  many  countries,  may  carry  over  to  climate 
mitigation, and open new opportunities (Section 5.1.2 in Chapter 5). COVID-19 appears to have accelerated 
the emergence of renewable power, electromobility and  digitalisation (Newman 2020;  Sectiopn 5.1.2 in 
Chapter 5, Section 6.3 in Chapter 6, Section 10.2 in Chapter 10). Institutional change is often very slow but 
major economic dislocation can create significant opportunities for new ways of financing and enabling 
‘leapfrogging’ investment to happen (Section 10.8 in Chapter 10). Given the unambiguous risks of climate 
change, and consequent stranded asset risks from new fossil fuel investments (Box 6.11), the most robust 
recoveries are likely to be those which emerge on lower carbon and resilient pathways  (Obergassel et al. 
2020).  Noting the critical global post-COVID-19 challenge as the double-impact of heightened credit risk 
in developing countries, along with indebtedness in developed countries, (Hourcade et al. 2021a) estimate 
that  a  ‘multilateral’  sovereign  guarantee  structure  to  underwrite  low  carbon  investments  could  leverage 
projects up to 15 times its value, contributing to shifting development pathways consistent with the SDGs 
and Paris goals. 

COVID- 19 can thus be taken as a reminder of the urgency of addressing climate change, a warning of the 
risk  of  future  stranded  assets  (Rempel  and  Gupta  2021;  and  Chapter  17),  but  also  an  opportunity  for  a 
cleaner recovery.

In addition to developments in climate science, emissions, the international agreements in 2015, and the 
recent impact of COVID-19, a few other key developments have strong implications for climate mitigation.

Cheaper Renewable Energy Technologies: Most striking, the cost of solar PV has fallen by a factor of 5-
10 in the decade since the IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy (IPCC 2011a) and other data inputting 
to the AR5 assessments, The SR1.5 reported major cost reductions, the IEA (2020) World Energy Outlook 
described PV as now ‘the cheapest electricity in history’ for projects that ‘tap low cost finance and high 
quality resources.’ Costs and deployment both vary widely between different countries (chapter 6, 9, 12) 
but costs are still projected to continue falling (Vartiainen et al. 2020). Rapid technological developments 
have occurred in many other low-carbon technologies including batteries and electric vehicles (see 1.4.3), 
IT and related control systems, with progress also where electrification is not possible (Chapters 2, 6, 11) 

Civil society pressures for stronger action. Civic engagement increased leading up to the Paris Agreement 
(Bäckstrand and Lövbrand 2019) and after. Youth movements in several countries show young people’s 
awareness about climate change, evidenced by the school strikes for the climate  (Hagedorn et al. 2019; 
Buettner 2020; Walker 2020; Thackeray et al. 2020). Senior figures across many religions (Francis 2015; 
IFEES 2015) stressed the duty of humanity to protect future generations and the natural world, and warned 
about the inequities of climate change.  Growing awareness of local environmental problems such as air 
pollution in Asia and Africa (Karlsson et al. 2020), and the threat to indigenous people rights and existence 
has  also  fuelled  climate  activism  (Etchart  2017).  Grass-root  movements  (Cheon  and  Urpelainen  2018; 
Fisher et al. 2019), build political pressure for accelerating climate change mitigation, as does increasing 
climate litigation (Setzer and Vanhala 2019; Chapters 13 and 14). 

Climate policies also encounter resistance. However there are multiple sources of resistance to climate 
action in practice. Corporations and trade associations often lobby against measures they deem detrimental 
(Section 1.4.6). The emblematic ‘yellow vest’ movement in France was triggered by higher fuel cost as a 
result of CO2 tax hike (Lianos 2019; Driscoll 2021), though it had broader aspect of income inequality and 
other social issues. There is often mismatch between concerns on climate change and people’s willingness 
to pay for mitigation. For example, whilst most Americans believe climate change is happening, 68% said 
in a survey they would oppose climate policies that added just USD10/month to electricity bills (EPIC et 
al. 2019), and worry about energy costs can eclipse those about climate change elsewhere (Poortinga et al. 
2018; Chapter 13). 

Global trends contrary to multilateral cooperation. State-centred politics and geopolitical/geo-economic 
tensions seem to have become more prominent  across many countries and issues (WEF 2019). In some 
cases,  multilateral  cooperation  could  be  threatened  by  trends  such  as  rising  populism,  nationalism, 
authoritarianism and growing protectionism (Abrahamsen et al. 2019), making it more difficult to tackle 
global challenges including protecting the environment (Schreurs 2016; Parker et al. 2017; WEF 2019). 

Transnational alliances. Partly countering this trend, cities, businesses, a wide range of other non-state 
actors also have emerged with important international networks to foster mitigation. City-based examples 
include the Cities Alliance in addressing climate change, Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, the Covenant of 
Mayors (chapter 8); there are numerous other alliances and networks such as those in finance (chapter 15), 
technology (chapter 16), amongst many others (chapters 13, 14).  

Finally, under the Paris Agreement process, during 2020/21, many countries strengthened their Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs). Including updates until October 2021, these would imply global GHG 
emissions  declining  by  2030  to  between  1-4%  below  2019  levels (unconditional  NDCs),  or  4-10%  (for 
NDCs conditional on international support), See Table 4.3 in Chapter 4 ).This is a significant change but 
would still not be compatible with 1.5°C pathways, and even if delivered in full, to likely stay below 2°C, 
emissions would have to fall very rapidly after 2030 (Section 3.2.5).

Thus, developments since AR5 highlight the complexity of the mitigation challenge. There is no far-sighted, 
globally optimising decision-maker and indeed climate policymaking at all levels is subject to conflicting 
pressures in multiple ways. The next section overviews the drivers and constraints.   

 

1.4  Drivers  and  Constraints  of  Climate  Mitigation  and  System 

Transitions/Transformation  

This section provides brief assessment of key factors and dynamics that drive, shape and or limit climate 
mitigation  in  (i)  Economic  factors:  which  include  sectors  and  services;  trade  and  leakage;  finance  and 
investment;  and  technological  innovation;  (ii)  Socio-political  issues;  which  include  political  economy; 
social  innovation  and  equity  and  fairness;  and  (iii)  Institutional  factors,  which  comprise  policy,  legal 
frameworks and international co-operation. 

AR  5  introduced  six  “enabling  conditions”  for  shifting  development  pathways  which  are  presented  in 
Chapter  4  of  this  report  and  some  of  which  overlap  with  the  drivers  reviewed  here.  However,  the 
terminology of drivers and constraints have been chosen here to reflect the fact that each of these factors 
can serve as an enabling condition or a constraint to ambitious climate action depending on the context and 
how they are deployed. Often one sees the factors exerting both push and pull forces at the same time in 
the  same  and  across  different  scales.  For example, finance  and  investments can  serve  as  a  barrier  or  an 
enabler to climate action (Battiston et al. 2021). Similarly, political economy factors can align in favour of 
ambitious climate action or act in ways that inhibit strong co-operation and low carbon transition. The other 
key insight from the assessment of the system drivers and constraints undertaken below is that none of the 
factors or conditions by themselves is more or less important than the others. In addition to being deeply 
intertwined all the factors matter in different measures with each exacting more or less force depending on 
prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context. Often achieving accelerated mitigation would 
require  effort  to  bring  several  of  the  factors  in  alignment  in  and  across  multiple  levels  of  political  or 
governance scales.  

1.4.1  Services, sectors and urbanisation 

Human activities drive emissions primarily through the demand for a wide range of  services such as food, 
shelter,  heating/cooling,  goods,  travel,  communication,  and  entertainment.  This  demand  is  fulfilled  by 
various activities often grouped into sectors such as agriculture,  industry and commerce. The literature 
uses  a  wide  range  of  sectoral  definitions  to  organize  data  and  analysis  (Chapter  2).  Energy  sectors  are 
typically  organised  into  primary  energy  producers,  energy  transformation  processes  (such  as  power 
generation, fuel refining), and major energy users such as buildings, industry, transport (Chapters 2, 5). 
Other research (Chapter 8) organizes data around interacting urban and rural human activities. Land-based 
activities can be organized into agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), or land use, land use 
change and forestry (LULUCF) (Chapter 7). Each set of sectoral definitions and analysis offers its own 
insights. 

Sectoral perspectives help to identify and understand the drivers of emissions, opportunities for emissions 
mitigation,  and  interactions  with  resources,  other  goals  and  other  sectors,  including  the  co-evolution  of 
systems  across  scales (Moss  et  al.  2016;  Kyle  et  al.  2016;  Mori  et  al.  2017;  IPBES  2019).  Interactions 
between sectors and agents pursuing multiple goals is a major theme pervading this assessment.

The ‘nexus’ between energy, water, and land – all key contributors to human well-being – also helps to 
provide, regulate and support  ecosystem and cultural services (Bazilian et al. 2011; Ringler et al. 2013; 
Smajgl et al. 2016; Albrecht et al. 2018; D’Odorico et al. 2018; Brouwer et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al. 
2019),  with  important  implications  for    cities  in  managing  new  systems  of  transformation   (Chapter  8; 
Thornbush et al. 2013; Wolfram et al. 2016) . Other important nexus’ shaping our planet’s future (Fajardy 
et al. 2018) include agriculture, forestry, land use and ecosystem services (Chazdon 2008; Keesstra et al. 
2018; Nesshöver et al. 2017; Torralba et al. 2016; Settele et al. 2016).  

Historically, energy-related GHG emissions were considered a by-product of the increasing scale of human 
activity,  driven  by  population  size,  economic  activity  and  technology.  That  simple  notion  has  evolved 
greatly over time to become much more complex and diverse, with increasing focus on the provision of 
energy services (Garrett et al. 2020; Bardi et al. 2019; Cullen and Allwood 2010; Brockway et al. 2019)) 
The demand for agricultural products has historically driven conversion of natural lands (land use change). 
AFOLU  along  with  food  processing  account  for  21-37%  of  total  net  anthropogenic  GHG  emissions 
(SRCCL SPM A3).5 

Continued growth in population and income are expected to continue driving up demand for goods and 
services  (Chapters  2,  3  &  5),  with  an  important  role  for  urbanisation  which  is  proceeding  at  an 
unprecedented speed and scale. In the last decade, the urban population grew by 70 million people each 
year, or about 1.3 million people per week, with urban area expanding by about 102 km2 per day (Chapter 
8). Urban areas account for most (45-87%) of the global carbon footprint (8.1) and the strong and positive 
correlation  between  urbanisation  and  incomes  means  higher  consumption  from  urban  lifestyles  will 
continue driving direct and indirect GHG emissions. Cities provide conduit to many of the services such as 
transportation, housing, water, food, medical care, recreation and other services and urban carbon emissions 
are driven not only by population and income but also by form and structure of urban areas (8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 
8.5,  8.6).  This  creates  opportunities  for  decarbonization  through  urban  planning  and  purposeful 
“experimentation” (Newman et al. 2017 Chapter 8). 

Human  needs  and  wants  evolve  over  time  making  the  transition  toward  climate  and  sustainable 
development  goals  either  more  or  less  difficult.  For  example,  changes  in  the  composition  of  goods 
consumed, such as, shifting diets toward a more vegetarian balance, can reduce land-use emissions without 
compromising the quality of life (Stehfest et al. 2009; van Vuuren et al. 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019; 
Hargreaves et al. 2021; Gough 2017; SRCCL SPM B2.3).  

Human behavior and choices, including joint achievement of wider social goals, will play an important part 
in  enabling  or  hindering  climate  mitigation  and  sustainable  development  (Shi  et  al.  2016),  for  example 
shifting  passenger  transportation  preferences  in  ways  that  combine  climate,  health  and  sustainable 
development goals (Romanello et al. 2021). 

1.4.2  Trade, consumption and leakage 

Emissions associated with international trade account for 20-33 % of global emissions, as calculated using 
multi-regional  input-output  analysis  (Wiedmann  and  Lenzen  2018).  Whether  international  trade  drives 
increase or decrease in global GHG emissions depends on emissions intensity of traded products as well as 
the influence of trade on relocation of production, with studies reaching diverse conclusions about the net 
effect  of  trade  openness  on  CO2  emissions  (Section  2.4.5).  Tariff  reduction  of  low  carbon  technologies 

 

FOOTNOTE5 AFOLU accounted for about 13% of CO2, 44% of CH4 and 82% of N2O global anthropogenic GHG 
emissions in 2007-2016 (SRCCL SPM A3).

could facilitate effective mitigation (de Melo and Vijil 2014; WTO 2016; Ertugrul et al. 2016; Islam et al. 
2016).  

The magnitude of carbon leakage (Annex I) caused by unilateral mitigation in a fragmented climate policy 
world depends on trade and substitution patterns of fossil fuels and the design of policies (see Box 5.4. 
AR5), but its potential significance in trade-exposed energy-intensive sectors (Naegele and Zaklan 2019; 
Carbone and Rivers 2017; Bauer et al. 2013)  can make it an important constraint on policy. See Section 
13.6.6.1 in Chapter 13 for channels and evidence. Akimoto et al. (2018) argue that differences in marginal 
abatement cost of NDCs could cause carbon leakage in energy-intensive, trade-exposed sectors, and could 
weaken effective global mitigation.   

Policy responses to cope with carbon leakage include border carbon adjustment (BCAs) and differentiated 
carbon  taxes  (Liu  et  al.  2020).  Some  BCA  options  focusing  on  levelling  the  cost  of  carbon  paid  by 
consumers on products could be designed in line with WTO (Ismer et al. 2016) while others may not be 
(Mehling et al. 2019). All proposals could involve difficulty of tracing and verifying the carbon content of 
inputs (Onder 2012; Denis-Ryan et al. 2016).   An international consensus and certification practice on the 
carbon content would help to overcome WTO compatibility (Holzer 2014). See chapter 13, and (Mehling 
et al. 2019) on context of trade law and the PA.  

Official inventories report territorial emissions, which do not consider the impacts embodied in imports of 
goods. Global supply chains undoubtedly lead to a growth in trade volumes (Federico and Tena-Junguito 
2017), alternative methods have been suggested to account for emissions associated with international trade, 
such  as  shared  responsibility  (Lenzen  et  al.  2007),  technology  adjusted  consumption  based  accounting 
(Kander et al. 2015), value added-based responsibility (Piñero et al. 2019) and exergy-based responsibility 
based  on  thermodynamics  (Khajehpour  et  al.  2019).  Consumption-based  emissions  (i.e.  attribution  of 
emissions related to domestic consumption and imports to final destination) are not officially reported in 
global emissions datasets but data has improved (Afionis et al. 2017; Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013). This 
analysis  have  been  used  extensively  for  consumption-based  accounting  of  emissions,  and  other 
environmental impacts (Malik et al. 2019; Wiedmann and Lenzen 2018). chapter 2.3).  

Increasing  international  trade  has  resulted  in  a  general  shifting  of  fossil-fuel  driven  emissions-intensive 
production from developed to developing countries (Arto and Dietzenbacher 2014; Malik and Lan 2016), 
and between developing countries (Zhang et al. 2019). High-income developed countries thus tend to be 
net importers of emissions, whereas low/middle income developing countries net-exporters (Peters et al. 
2011; Figure 1.2c, d).This trend is shifting, with a growth in trade between non-OECD countries (Meng et 
al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019), and a decline in emissions intensity of traded goods (Wood et al. 2020b).  

The  Paris  Agreement  primarily  deals  with  national  commitments  relating  to  domestic  emissions  and 
removals, hence emissions from international aviation and shipping are not covered. Aviation and shipping 
accounted for approximately 2.7% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 (before COVID-19); see Chapter 
10.5.2 for discussion. In addition to CO2 emissions, aircraft-produced contrail cirrus clouds and emissions 
of black carbon and short-lived aerosols (e.g. sulphates) from shipping are especially harmful for the Arctic 
(10.8, Box 10.6).  

1.4.3  Technology 

The rapid developments in technology over the past decade enhance potential for transformative changes, 
in particular to help deliver climate goals simultaneously with other SDGs.

The fall in renewable energy costs alongside rapid growth in capacity (Figure 1.3; Figure X in Chapter 2) 
has been accompanied by varied progress in many other technology areas such electric vehicles, fuel cells 
for both stationary and mobile applications (Dodds 2019), thermal energy (chapter 6) and battery and other 
storage technologies  (Chapters 6, 9, 12; Freeman et al. 2017). Nuclear contributions may be enhanced by 
new generations of reactors, e.g., Generation III, and small modular reactors (Knapp and Pevec 2018; see 
also Chapter 6).

Large-scale  hydrogen  developments  could  provide  a  complementary  energy  channel  with  long-term 
storage. Like electricity, hydrogen (H2) is an energy vector with multiple potential applications,   including 
in  industrial  processes  such  as  steel  and  non-metallic  materials  production  (Chapter  11),  for  long-range 
transportation (Chapter 10), and  low-temperature heating in buildings (Chapter 9). Emissions depend on 
how it is produced, and deploying H2 delivery infrastructure economically is a challenge when the future 
scale of hydrogen demand is so uncertain (Chapter 6). H2 from natural gas with CO2 capture and storage 
(CCS) may help to kick-start the H2 economy (Sunny et al. 2020).  

CO2-based  fuels  and  feedstocks  such  as  synthetic  methane,  methanol,  diesel,  jet  fuel  and  other 
hydrocarbons,  potentially  from  carbon  capture  and  utilisation  (CCU),  represent  drop-in  solutions  with 
limited new infrastructure needs (Artz et al. 2018; Bobeck et al. 2019; Yugo and Soler 2019); Chapter 10. 
Deployment and development of CCS technologies (with large-scale storage of captured CO2) have been 
much slower than projected in previous Assessments (Page et al. 2019; IEA 2019b; see also Chapter 11).  

Potential  constraints  on  new  energy  technologies  may  include  their  material  requirements,  notably  rare 
earth  materials  for  electronics  or  lithium  for  batteries  (Wanger  2011;  Flexer  et  al.  2018),  stressing  the 
importance  of  recycling  (Rosendahl  and  Rubiano  2019;  IPCC  2011b).  Innovation  is  enabling  greater 
recycling and re-use of energy-intensive materials (Shemi et al. 2018) and introducing radically new and 
more environmentally friendly materials, however, still not all materials can be recycled (Allwood 2014).   

By sequestering carbon in biomass and soils, soil carbon management, and other terrestrial strategies could 
offset hard-to-reduce emissions in other sectors. However, large-scale bioenergy deployment could increase 
risks of  desertification, land  degradation, and food insecurity (IPCC 2019a), and higher water withdrawals 
(Hasegawa et al. 2018; Fuhrman et al. 2020), though this may be at least partially offset by innovation in 
agriculture, diet shifts and plant-based proteins contributing to meeting demand for food, feed, fibre and, 
bioenergy (or BECCS with CCS) (Chapters 5, 7; Köberle et al. 2020; Havlik et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017).

A broad class of more speculative technologies propose to counteract effects of climate change by removing 
CO2 from the atmosphere (CDR), or directly modify the Earth’s energy balance at a large scale (SRM). 
CDR technologies include ocean iron fertilisation, enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinisation (Council 
2015a), along with Direct Air Capture with Carbon Storage (DACCS). They could potentially draw down 
atmospheric CO2 much faster than the Earth’s natural carbon cycle, and reduce reliance on biomass-based 
removal  (Realmonte  et  al.  2019;  Köberle  2019),  but  some  present  novel  risks  to  the  environment  and 
DACCS is currently more expensive than most other forms of mitigation (Fuss et al. 2018; Cross-chapter 
box 8 in Chapter 12). Solar radiation modification (SRM) could potentially cool the planet rapidly at low 
estimated direct costs by reflecting incoming sunlight (Council 2015b), but entails uncertain side effects 
and thorny international equity and governance challenges (Netra et al. 2018; Florin et al. 2020; National 
Academies of Sciences 2021) (Chapter 14). Understanding the climate response to SRM remains subject 
to large uncertainties (AR6 WG1). Some literature uses the term “geoengineering” for both CDR or SRM 
when  applied  at  a  planetary  scale  (Shepherd  2009;  GESAMP  2019).  In  this  report,  CDR  and  SRM  are 
discussed separately reflecting their very different geophysical characteristics.  

Large  improvements  in  information  storage,  processing,  and  communication  technologies,  including 
artificial intelligence, will affect emissions. They can enhance energy-efficient control, reduce transaction 
cost for energy production and distribution, improve demand-side management (Raza and Khosravi 2015), 
and reduce the need for physical transport (Smidfelt Rosqvist and Winslott Hiselius 2016; see Chapters 5, 
6, 9-11). However, data centres and related IT systems (including blockchain), are electricity-intensive and 
will raise demand for energy (Avgerinou et al. 2017) - cryptocurrencies may be a major global source of 
CO2 if the electricity production is not decarbonised (Mora et al. 2018) – and there is also a concern that 
information technologies can compound and exacerbate current inequalities (Chapter 16; Box 2). IT may 
affect broader patterns of work and leisure (Boppart and Krusell 2020), and the emissions intensity of how 
people spend their leisure time will become more important (see Chapters 5, 9). Because higher efficiency 
tends to reduces costs, it often involves some ‘rebound’ offsetting at least some of the emission savings 
(Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Sudbury and Hutchinson 2016; Cohen and Cavoli 2019). 

Technology can enable both emissions reductions and/or increased emissions (Chapter 16). Governments 
play an important role in most major innovations, in both ‘technology-push’ (Mazzucato 2013) and induced 
by  ‘demand-pull’  (Grubb  et  al.  2021a),  so  policy  is  important  in  determining  its  pace,  direction,  and 
utilisation  (Roberts and Geels 2019a; Sections 1.7.1, 1.7.3). Overall, the challenge will be to enhance the 
synergies and minimise the trade-offs and rebounds, including taking account of ethical and distributional 
dimensions (Gonella et al. 2019). 

1.4.4  Finance and investment   

Finance is both an enabler and constraint on mitigation, and since AR5, attention to the financial sector’s 
role in mitigation has grown. This is partly in the context of the Paris Agreement finance articles and Green 
Climate  Fund,  the  pledge  to  mobilise  USD100bn/yr  by  2020,  and  the  Addis  Abbaba  Action  Agenda 
(Section  1.3.1).    However  there  is  a  persistent  but  uncertain  gap  in  mitigation  finance  (Cui  and  Huang 
2018);  (Table  15.15.1),  even  though  tracked  climate  finance  overwhelmingly  goes  toward  mitigation 
compared to adaptation (UNEP 2020; 15.3; Working Group II). Green bond issuance has increased recently 
in  parallel  with  efforts  to  reform  the  international  financial  system  by  supporting  development  of  local 
capital markets (15.6.4).  

Climate finance is a multi-actor, multi-objective domain that includes central banks, commercial banks, 
asset managers, underwriters, development banks, and corporate planners. Climate change presents both

risks and opportunities for the financial sector. The risks include physical risks related to the impacts of 
climate change itself; transition risks related to the exposure to policy, technology and behavioural changes 
in line with a low-carbon transition; and liability risks from litigation for climate-related damages (Box 
15.2).  These could potentially lead to stranded assets (the loss of economic value of existing assets before 
the end of their useful lifetimes (Bos and Gupta 2019; Section 6.7 in Chapter 6, Section 15.6.3 in Chapter 
15). Such risks continue to be underestimated by financial institutions (Section 15.6.1 in Chapter 15). The 
continuing  expansion  of  fossil  fuel  infrastructure  and  insufficient  transparency  on  how  these  are  valued 
raises concerns that systemic risk may be accumulating in the financial sector in relation to a potential low-
carbon transition that may already be under way (Battiston et al. 2017; Section 15.6.3 in Chapter 15). The 
Financial  Stability  Board’s  TCFD  recommendations  on  transparency  aim  to  ensure  that  investors  and 
companies  consider  climate  change risks in  their  strategies and  capital  allocation  (TCFD  2018).  This is 
helping "investors to reassess core assumptions” and may lead to “significant” capital reallocation  (Fink 
2020).  However,  metrics  and  indicators  of  assets  risk  exposure  are  inadequate  (Campiglio  et  al.  2018; 
Monasterolo  2017)  and  transparency  alone  is  insufficient  to  drive  the  required  asset  reallocation  in  the 
absence of clear regulatory frameworks (Chenet et al. 2021; Ameli et al. 2020). A coalition of Central Banks 
have formed the Network for Greening the Financial Sector,  to support and advance the transformation of 
the  financial  system  (Allen  et  al.  2020;  NGFS  2020),  with  some  of  them  conducting  Climate-related 
institutional stress tests 

Governments cannot singlehandedly fund the transition (Section 15.6.7 in Chapter 15), least of all in low-
income developing countries with large sovereign debt and poor access to global financial markets. Long-
term  sources  of  private  capital  are  required  to  close  the  financing  gap  across  sectors  and  geographies 
(Section 15.6.7 in Chapter 15). Future investment needs are greatest in emerging and developing economies 
(Section 15.5.2 In Chapter 15) which already face higher cost of capital, hindering capacity to finance a 
transition (Buhr et al. 2018; Ameli et al. 2020). Requisite North-South financial flows are impeded by both 
geographic  and  technological  risk  premiums  (Iyer  et  al.  2015),  and  the  Covid-19  pandemic  has  further 
compromised the ability of developing and emerging economies to finance development activities or attract 
additional climate finance from developed countries (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this chapter; Section 15.6.3 
in Chapter 15).  Climate-related investments in developing countries also suffer from structural barriers 
such as sovereign risk and exchange rate volatility  (Farooquee and Shrimali 2016; Guzman et al. 2018) 
which affect not only climate-related investment but investment in general (Yamahaki et al. 2020) including 
in needed infrastructure development  (Gray and Irwin 2003). A GCF report notes the paradox that USD14 
trillion of negative-yielding debt in OECD countries might be expected  to flow to much larger low-carbon, 
climate-resilient investment opportunities in developing countries, but “this is not happening” (Hourcade 
et al. 2021b). 

There is often a disconnect between stated national climate ambition and finance flows, and overseas direct 
investment (ODI) from donor countries may be at odds with national climate pledges such as NDCs. One 
report found funds supported by foreign State-Owned Enterprises into 56 recipient countries in Asia and 
Africa  in  2014-2017  went  mostly  to  fossil  fuel-based  projects  not  strongly  aligned  with  low-carbon 
priorities of recipient countries’ NDCs (Zhou et al. 2018). Similarly, Steffen and Schmidt (2019) found that 
even  within  Multilateral  Development  Banks,  ‘public-  and  private-sector  branches  differ  considerably’, 
with public-sector lending used mainly in non-renewable and hydropower projects. Political leadership is 
therefore essential to steer financial flows to support low carbon transition (15.6). Voituriez er al. (2019) 
identify  significant  mitigation  potential  if  financing  countries  simply  applied  their  own  environmental 
standards to their overseas investments.

The politics of interest (most especially economic interest) of key actors at subnational, national and global 
level can be important determinants of climate (in)action  (O’Hara 2009; Lo 2010; Tanner and Allouche 
2011; Sovacool et al. 2015; Clapp et al. 2018; Lohmann 2017; Newell and Taylor 2018; Lohmann 2019). 
Political economy approaches can be crudely divided into “economic approaches to politics”, and those 
used by other social scientists (Paterson and P‐Laberge 2018). The former shows how electoral concerns 
lead to weak treaties (Battaglini and Harstad 2016) and when policy negotiations cause status-quo biases 
and  the  use  of  inefficient  policy  instruments  (Austen-Smith  et  al.  2019)  or  delays  and  excessive 
harmonization (Harstad 2007). The latter emphasises the central role of structures of power, production, 
and a commitment to economic growth and capital accumulation in relation to climate action, given the 
historically central role of fossil fuels to economic development and the deep embedding of fossil energy 
in daily life (Malm 2015; Huber 2012; Di Muzio 2015; Newell and Paterson 2010).  

The economic centrality of fossil fuels raises obvious questions regarding the possibility of decarbonisation. 
Economically, this is well understood as a problem of decoupling. But the constraint is also political, in 
terms of the power of incumbent fossil fuel interests to block initiatives towards decarbonisation (Newell 
and Paterson 2010; Geels 2014; Jones and Levy 2009). The effects of climate policy are key considerations 
in deciding the level of policy ambition and direction and strategies of states (Alam et al. 2013; Ibikunle 
and Okereke 2014; Lo 2010), regions (Goldthau and Sitter 2015); and business actors  (Wittneben et al. 
2012) and there is a widespread cultural assumption that continued fossil fuel use is central to this (Strambo 
and Espinosa 2020). Decarbonisation strategies are often centred around projects to develop new sources 
of economic activity: carbon markets creating new commodities to trade profit from (Newell and Paterson 
2010); the investment generated in new urban infrastructure (Whitehead 2013); innovations in a range of 
new energy technologies (Fankhauser et al. 2013; Lachapelle et al. 2017; Meckling and Nahm 2018).   

One factor limiting the ambition of climate policy has been the ability of incumbent industries to shape 
government action on climate change (Newell and Paterson 1998; Breetz et al. 2018; Jones and Levy 2009; 
Geels 2014). Incumbent industries are often more concentrated than those benefiting from climate policy 
and lobby more effectively to prevent losses than those who would gain (Meng and Rode 2019). Drawing 
upon wider networks (Brulle 2014), campaigns by oil and coal companies against climate action in the US 
and Australia are perhaps the most well-known and largely successful of these (Brulle et al. 2020; Stokes 
2020; Mildenberger 2020; Pearse 2017) although similar dynamics have been demonstrated for example in 
Brazil and South Africa (Hochstetler 2020), Canada (Harrison 2018), Norway , or Germany (Fitzgerald et 
al.  2019).  In  other  contexts,  resistance  by  incumbent  companies  is  more  subtle  but  nevertheless  has 
weakened policy design on emissions trading systems (Rosembloom and Markard 2020), and limited the 
development of alternative fuelled automobiles (Wells and Nieuwenhuis 2012; Levy and Egan 2003).  

The interaction of politics, power and economics is central in explaining why countries with higher  per-
capita emissions, which logically have more opportunities to reduce emissions, in practice often take the 
opposite  stance,  and  conversely,  why  some  low-emitting  countries  may  find  it  easier  to  pursue  climate 
action because they have fewer vested interests in high-carbon economies. These dynamics can arise from 
the vested interest of State-owned Enterprises (Polman 2015; Wright and Nyberg 2017; Wittneben et al. 
2012), the alignment and coalitions of countries in climate negotiations (Gupta 2016; Okereke and Coventry 
2016), and the patterns of opposition to or support for climate policy among citizens (Swilling et al. 2016; 
Ransan-Cooper et al. 2018; Turhan et al. 2019; Baker 2015; Heffron and McCauley 2018).

Equity  and  fairness  can  serve  as  both  driver  and  barrier  to  climate  mitigation  at  different  scales  of 
governance. Literature regularly highlights equity and justice issues as critical components in local politics 
and international diplomacy regarding all SDG, such as goals for no poverty, zero hunger, gender equality, 
affordable clean energy, reducing inequality, but also for climate action (Goal 13) (Marmot and Bell 2018; 
Spijkers  2018).  Equity  issues  help  explain  why  it  has  proved  hard  to  reach  more  substantive  global 
agreements, as it is hard to agree on a level of greenhouse gas mitigation (or emissions) and how to distribute 
mitigation  efforts  among  countries  (Kverndokk  2018)  for  several  reasons.  First,  an  optimal  trade-off 
between  mitigation  costs  and  damage  costs  of  climate  change  depends  on  ethical  considerations,  and 
simulations  from  integrated  assessment  models  using  different  ethical  parameters  producing  different 
optimal  mitigation  paths,  see  (IPCC  2018b  and  Section  3.6.1.2  in  Chapter  3).  Second,  treaties  that  are 
considered  unfair  may  be  hard  to  implement  (Liu  et  al.  2017;  Klinsky  et  al.  2017).  Lessons  from 
experimental economics show that people may not accept a distribution that is considered unfair, even if 
there  is  a  cost  of  not  accepting  (Gampfer  2014).  As  equity  issues  are  important  for  reaching  deep 
decarbonisation, the transition towards a sustainable development (Okereke 2018; Evans and Phelan 2016; 
Heffron  and  McCauley  2018)  depends  on  taking  equity  seriously  in  climate  policies  and  international 
negotiations (Martinez et al. 2019; Okereke and Coventry 2016; Klinsky et al. 2017). 

Climate change and climate policies affect countries and people differently Low-income countries tend to 
be  more  dependent  on  primary  industries  (agriculture,  fisheries,  etc.)  than  richer  countries,  and  their 
infrastructure may be less robust to tackle more severe weather conditions. Within a country, the burdens 
may  not  be  equally  distributed  either,  due  to  policy  measures  implemented  and  from  differences  in 
vulnerability and adaptive capacity following from e.g. income and wealth distribution, race and gender. 
For instance, unequal social structures can result in women being more vulnerable to the effects of climate 
change compared to men, especially in poor countries  (Jost et al. 2016; Rao et al. 2019; Arora-Jonsson 
2011). Costs of mitigation also differ across countries. Studies show there are large disparities of economic 
impacts of NDCs across regions, and also between relatively similar countries when it comes to the level 
of  development,  due  to  large  differences  in  marginal  abatement  cost  for  the  emission  reduction  goal  of 
NDCs (Akimoto et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2016; Edmonds et al. 2019; Hof et al. 2017).  Equalizing the 
burdens from climate policies may give more support for mitigation policies (Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019).  

Taking equity into account in designing an international climate agreement is complicated as there is no 
single universally accepted equity criterion, and countries may strategically choose a criterion that favours 
them  (Lange  et  al.  2007,  2010).  Still,  several  studies  analyse  the  consequences  of  different  social 
preferences  in  designing  climate  agreements,  such  as  for  instance  inequality  aversion,  sovereignty  and 
altruism (Anthoff et al. 2010; Kverndokk et al. 2014). 

International transfers from rich to poor countries to support mitigation and adaptation activities may help 
equalizing burdens, as agreed upon in the UNFCCC (1992; Chapters 14 and 15) such  that they may be 
motivated by strategic as well as equity reasons (Kverndokk 2018; see also 1.4.4). 

1.4.7  Social innovation and behaviour change 

Social  and  psychological  factors  affect  both  perceptions  and  behaviour  (Whitmarsh  et  al.  2021;  Weber 
2015).  Religion,  values,  culture,  gender,  identity,  social  status  and  habits  strongly  influence  individual 
behaviours and choices and therefore, sustainable consumption (Section 1.6.3.1 in this chapter and Section 
5.2 in Chapter 5). Identities can provide powerful attachments to consumption activities and objects that 
inhibit shifts away from them (Stoll-Kleemann and Schmidt 2017; Ruby et al. 2020; Brekke et al. 2003;

Bénabou and Tirole 2011). Consumption is a habit-driven and social practice rather than simply a set of 
individual decisions, making shifts in consumption harder to pursue (Evans et al. 2012; Shove and Spurling 
2013; Kurz et al. 2015; Warde 2017; Verplanken and Whitmarsh 2021). Finally, shifts towards low-carbon 
behaviour are also inhibited by social-psychological and political dynamics that cause individuals to ignore 
the connections from daily consumption practices to climate change impacts (Norgaard 2011; Brulle and 
Norgaard 2019). 

As a notable example, plant-based alternatives to meat could  reduce emissions from diets (Willett et al. 
2019; Eshel et al. 2019) however, diets are deeply entrenched in cultures and identities and hard to change 
(Fresco 2015; Mylan 2018). Changing diets also raises cross-cultural ethical issues, in addition to meat’s 
role in providing nutrition (Plumwood 2004). Henceforth, some behaviours that are harder to change will 
only  be  transformed  by  the  transition  itself:  triggered  by  policies,  the  transition  will  bring  about 
technologies that, in turn, will entrench new sustainable behaviours. 

Behaviour can be influenced  through a number of mechanisms besides economic policy and regulation, 
such  as  information  campaigns,  advertising  and  ‘nudging’.  Innovations  and  infrastructure  also  impact 
behaviour, as with bicycle lanes to reduce road traffic. Wider social innovations also have indirect impacts. 
Education is increasing across the world, and higher education will have impacts on fertility, consumption 
and the attitude towards the environment (Osili and Long 2008; McCrary and Royer 2011; Hamilton 2011). 
Reducing  poverty  and  improvements  in  health  and  reproductive  choice  will  also  have  implications  for 
fertility, energy use and consumption globally. Finally, social capital and the ability to work collectively 
may have large consequences for mitigation and the ability to adapt to climate change (Adger 2009; Section 
4.3.5 in IPCC 2014a). 

1.4.8  Policy impacts 

Transformation to different systems will hinge on conscious policy to change the direction in which energy, 
land-use, agriculture and other key sectors develop (Bataille et al. 2016; Chapters 13, 16).  Policy plays a 
central  role  in  in  land-related  systems  (Chapter  7),  urban  development  (Chapter  8),  improving  energy 
efficiency  in  buildings  (Chapter  9)  and  transport  /  mobility  (Chapter  10),  and  decarbonising  industrial 
systems (Chapter 11).  

Policy has been and will be central not only because greenhouse gas emissions are almost universally under-
priced  in  market  economies  (Stern  and  Stiglitz  2017;  World  Bank  2019),  and  because  of  inadequate 
economic incentives to innovation (Jaffe et al. 2005) but also due to various delay mechanisms (Karlsson 
and Gilek 2020) and multiple sources of path-dependence and lock-in to existing systems (Section 1.8.2), 
including  “Infrastructure  developments  and  long-lived  products  that  lock  societies  into  GHG-intensive 
emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change, reinforcing the importance of early action 
for ambitious mitigation (robust evidence, high agreement).” (AR5 p.18).   

Many hundreds of policies have been introduced explicitly to mitigate GHG emissions, improve energy 
efficiency or land use, or to foster low carbon industries and innovation, with demonstrable impact. The 
role of policy to date has been most evident in energy efficiency (Sections 5.4 and 5.6 in Chapter 5) and 
electricity (Chapter 6). The IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy already found that “Government 
policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies”,  (IPCC 2011a, p. 24). Policy 
packages since then have driven rapid expansion in renewables capacity and cost reductions (eg. through 
the German Energiewende), and emission reductions from electricity (most dramatically with the halving 
of CO2 emissions from UK power sector, driven by multiple policy instruments and regulatory changes), 
as detailed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.7.5).

Chapter 13 charts the international evolution of policies and many of the lessons drawn. Attributing the 
overall  impact  on  emissions  is  complex,  but  an  emerging  literature  of  several  hundred  papers  indicates 
impacts on multiple drivers of emissions. Collectively, policies are likely to have curtailed global emissions 
growth by several GtCO2e annually already by the mid-2010s (see Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 14). 
This suggests initial evidence that policy has driven some decoupling (e.g. Figure 1.1d) and started to ‘bend 
the curve’ of global emissions, but more specific attribution to observed trends is not as yet possible.6  

However, some policies (e.g. subsidies to fossil fuel production or consumption), increase emissions; whilst 
others  (e.g.  investment  protection)  may  constrain  efforts  at  mitigation.  Also,  wider  economic  and 
developmental policies have important direct and indirect impacts on emissions. Policy is thus both a driver 
and a constraint on mitigation.  

Synergies and trade-offs arise partly because of the nexus of GHG emissions with other adverse impacts 
(e.g. local air pollution) and critical resources (e.g. water and food) (Conway et al. 2015; Andrews-Speed 
and Dalin 2017), which also imply interacting policy domains.  

The literature shows increasing emphasis on policy packages, including those spanning the different levels 
of  niche/behaviour;  existing  regimes  governing  markets  and  public  actors;  and  strategic  and  landscape 
levels  (Section  1.7.3).  Chapters  13,  16,  and  17  appraise  policies  for  transformation  in  the  context  of 
sustainable development, indicating the importance of policy as a driver at multiple levels and across many 
actors, with potential for benefits as well as costs at many levels. 

National-level legislation may be particularly important to the credibility and long-term stability of policy 
to  reduce  the  risks,  and  hence  cost,  of  finance  (Chapters  13,  15)  and  for  encouraging  private  sector 
innovation at scale (Chapter 16), for example if it offers greater stability and mid-term predictability for 
carbon prices; Nash and Steurer (2019) find that seven national Climate Change Acts in European countries 
all act as ‘living policy processes, though to varying extents’. 

The  importance  of  policy  at  multiple  levels  does  not  lessen  the  importance  of  international  policy,  for 
reasons including long-term stability, equity, and scope, but examples of effective implementation policy 
at international levels remain fewer and governance weaker (Chapter 14).   

1.4.9  Legal framework and institutions 

Institutions are rules and norms held in common by social actors that guide, constrain and shape human 
interaction (IPCC 2018b). Institutions can be formal, such as laws and policies, or informal, such as norms 
and conventions. Institutions can both facilitate or constrain climate policy-making and implementation in 
multiple ways. Institutions set the economic incentives for action or inaction on climate change at national, 
regional and individual levels (Dorsch and Flachsland 2017; Sullivan 2017).    

 

FOOTNOTE 6 Linking estimated policy impacts to trends is complex, and as yet very tentative. An important factor 
is that many mitigation policies involve investments in low carbon or energy efficient technology, the savings from 
which persist. As a purely illustrative example: the annual increase in global emissions during 2000-2010 averaged 
around 1GtCO2e yr-1, but with large fluctuations.  If policies by 2010 reduced the  annual increase in that year by 
100MtCO2e (0.1GtC02e) below what it would otherwise have been, this is hard to discern.  But if these savings sustain, 
and in each subsequent year, policies cut another 100MtCO2e off the annual increase compared to the previous year, 
global emissions after a decade would be around 5GtCO2e yr-1 below what they would have been without any such 
policies, and on average close to stabilising. However each step would be difficult to discern in the noise of annual 
fluctuations.

Institutions entrench specific political decision-making processes, often empowering some interests over 
others, including powerful interest groups who have vested interest in maintaining the current high carbon 
economic structures (Engau et al. 2017; Okereke and Russel 2010; Wilhite 2016); see also 1.4.6 and Chapter 
13 on the sub national and national governance challenges including coordination, mediating politics and 
strategy setting.  

Some suggest that societal transformation towards low a carbon future requires new politics that involves 
thinking in intergenerational time horizons, as well as new forms of partnerships between private and public 
actors  (Westman  and  Broto  2018),  and  associated  institutions  and  social  innovations  to  increase 
involvement of non-state actors in climate governance (Fuhr et al. 2018). However literature is divided as 
to  how  much  democratisation  of  climate  politics,  with  greater  emphasis  on  equity  and  community 
participation, would advance societal transformation in the face of climate change (Stehr 2005), or may 
actually hinder radical climate action in some circumstances (Povitkina 2018).  

Since  2016,  the  number  of  climate  litigation  cases  has  increased  rapidly.  UN  Environment’s  “Global 
Climate Litigation Report: 2020 Status Review” (UNEP 2020) noted that between March 2017 and 1 July 
2020, the number of cases nearly doubled with at least 1,550 climate cases filed in 8 countries. Several 
important cases such as Urgenda Foundation v. The State of the Netherlands (“Urgenda”) and Juliana et al 
v. United States (“Juliana”)  have had ripple effects, inspiring other similar cases (Lin and Kysar 2020).  

Numerous  international  climate  governance  initiatives  engage  national  and  subnational  governments, 
NGOs and private corporations, constituting a “regime complex” (Keohane and Victor 2011; Raustiala and 
Victor 2004). They may have longer-run and second-order effects if commitments are more precise and 
binding (Kahler 2017). However, without targets, incentives, defined baseline or monitoring, reporting, and 
verification, they are not likely to fill the “mitigation gap” (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017).  

1.4.10  International cooperation  

Tackling climate change is often mentioned as an  important reason for strong international co-operation in 
the 21st century (Bodansky et al. 2017; Cramton et al. 2017b; Keohane and Victor 2016; Falkner 2016). 
Mitigation costs are borne by countries taking action, while the benefits of reduced climate change are not 
limited  to  them,  being  in  economic  terms  “global  and  non-excludable”.  Hence  anthropogenic  climate 
change is typically seen as a global commons problem (Wapner and Elver 2017; Falkner 2016). Moreover, 
the belief that mitigation will raise energy cost and may adversely affect competitiveness creates incentives 
for free riding, where states avoid taking their fair share of action (Barrett 2005; Keohane and Victor 2016). 
International cooperation has the potential to address these challenges through collective action (Tulkens, 
2019) and international institutions offer opportunity for actors to engage in meaningful communication, 
and exchange of ideas about potential solutions (Cole 2015). International cooperation is also vital for the 
creation and diffusion of norms and the framework for stabilising expectations among actors  (Pettenger 
2016).  

Some key roles of the UNFCCC have been detailed by its former heads (Kinley et al. 2021). In addition to 
specific agreements (most recently the PA) it has enhanced transparency through reporting and data, and 
generated or reinforced several important norms for global climate action including the principles of equity, 
common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, and the precautionary principles for 
maintaining global cooperation among states with unevenly distributed emissions sources, climate impacts, 
and varying mitigation cost across countries (Keohane and Victor, 2016). In addition to formal negotiations, 
the  annual  Conference  of  Parties  have  increased  awareness,  and  motivated  more  ambitious  actions, 
sometimes  through  for  example  the  formation  of  ‘coalitions  of  the  willing’.  It  provides  a  structure  for

measuring  and  monitoring  action  towards  a  global  goal  (Milkoreit  and  Haapala  2019).  International 
cooperation (including the UNFCCC) can also promote technology development and transfer and capacity 
building; mobilise finance for mitigation and adaptation, and help address concerns on climate justice (Chan 
et al. 2018; Okereke and Coventry 2016; see Chapters 14-16).  

A  common  criticism  of  international  institutions  is  their  limited  (if  any)  powers  to  enforce  compliance 
(Zahar 2017). As a global legal institution, the PA has little enforcement mechanism (Sindico 2015), but 
enforcement is not a necessary condition for an instrument to be legally binding (Bodansky 2016; Rajamani 
2016). In reality implementation of specific commitments tends to be high once countries have ratified and 
a Treaty or an Agreement is in force (Bodansky 2016; Rajamani 2016). Often, the problem is not so much 
of 'power to enforce compliance or sanction non-compliance', but the level of ambition (Chapter 14).  

However,  whilst  in  most  respects  a  driver,  international  cooperation  has  also  been  characterised  as 
‘organised  hypocrisy’  where  proclamations  are  not  matched  with  corresponding  action  (Egnell  2010).  
Various  reasons  for  inadequate  progress  after  30  years  of  climate  negotiations,  have  been  identified 
(Stoddard et al. 2021).  International cooperation can also seem to be a barrier to ambitious action when 
negotiation  is  trapped  in  ‘relative-gains’  calculus,  seek  to  game  the  regime  or  gain    leverage  over  one 
another (Purdon 2017), or where states lower ambition to the ‘least common dominator’ to accommodate 
participation  of  the  least  ambitious  states  (Falkner  2016).  Geden  (2016)  and  Dubash  (2020)  offer  more 
nuanced assessments. 

International  collaboration  works  best  if  an  agreement  can  be  made  self-reinforcing  with  incentives  for 
mutual gains and joint action  (Keohane and Victor 2016; Barrett 2016), but the structure of the climate 
challenge  makes  this  hard  to  achieve.  The  evidence  from  the  Montreal  Protocol  on  ozone  depleting 
substances and from the Kyoto Protocol on GHGs, is that legally binding targets have been effective in that 
participating Parties complied with them (Albrecht and Parker 2019; Shishlov et al. 2016), and (for Kyoto) 
these account for most of the countries that have sustained emission reductions for at least the past 10-15 
years  (Section  1.3.2;  Section  2.2  in  Chapter  2).  However,  such  binding  commitments  may  deter 
participation if there are no clear incentives to sustain participation and especially if other growing emitters 
are  omitted  by  design,  as  with  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  Consequently  the  US  refused  to  ratify  (and  Canada 
withdrew),  particularly  on  the  grounds  that  developing  countries  had  no  targets;  with  participation  in 
Kyoto’s  second  period  commitments  declining  further,  the  net  result  was  limited  global  progress  in 
emissions under Kyoto (Scavenius and Rayner 2018; Bodansky 2016; Okereke and Coventry 2016) despite 
full legal compliance in both commitment periods (chapter 14).  

The negotiation of the Paris Agreement was thus done in the context of serious questions about how best 
to structure international climate cooperation to achieve better results. This new agreement is designed to 
side-step the fractious bargaining which characterised international climate cooperation (Marcu 2017). It 
contains a mix of hard, soft and non-obligations, the boundaries between which are blurred, but each of 
which plays a distinct and valuable role (Rajamani 2016). The provisions of the PA could encourage flexible 
responses  to  changing  conditions,  but  limit  assurances  of  ambitious  national  commitments  and  their 
fulfilment (Pickering et al. 2018). The extent to which this new arrangement will drive ambitious climate 
policy in the long run remains to be seen (Chapter 14).  

Whilst the PA abandoned common accounting systems and timeframes, outside the UNFCCC many other 
platforms and metrics for comparing mitigation efforts have emerged  (Aldy 2015). Countries may assess 
others’  efforts  in  determining  their  actions  through  multiple    platforms  including  Climate  Change 
Cooperation  Index  (C3-I),  Climate  Change  Performance  Index  (CCPI)  ‘Climate  Laws,  Institutions  and

International cooperative initiatives between and among non-state (e.g., business, investors, civil society) 
and  subnational  (e.g.,  city,  state)  actors  have  also  been  emerging,  taking  the  forms  of  public-private 
partnerships,  private  sector  governance  initiatives,  NGO  transnational  initiatives,  and  subnational 
transnational initiatives (Bulkeley and Schroeder 2012; Hsu et al. 2018). Literature is mostly positive about 
the role of these transnational initiatives in facilitating climate action across scales although criticism and 
caution about their accountability and effectiveness remain (Chan et al. 2016; Roger et al. 2017; Widerberg 
and Pattberg 2017; Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017; Chapter 14).  

 

1.5  Emissions Scenarios and Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) 

Scenarios are a powerful tool for exploring an uncertain future world against the background of alternative 
choices  and  development.   Scenarios can  be constructed  using  both  narrative  and  quantitative methods. 
When these two methods are combined they provide complementary information and insights. Quantitative 
and  narrative  models  are  frequently  used  to  represent  scenarios  to  explore  choices  and  challenges.  The 
IPCC has a long history of assessing scenarios  (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; van Vuuren et al. 2011, 2014; see 
also section 1.6 of AR6 WGI for a history of scenarios within the IPCC). This WGIII assessment employs 
a wide range of qualitative and quantitative scenarios including quantitative scenarios developed through a 
wide and heterogeneous set of tools ranging from spreadsheets to complex computational models (Annex 
III provides further discussion and examples of computational models).   

The concept of an illustrative pathway (IP) was introduced in IPCC Special Report on 1.5 (IPCC 2018b) 
to highlight a subset of the quantitative scenarios, drawn from a larger pool of published literature, with 
specific characteristics that would help represent some of the key findings emerging from the assessment 
in terms of different strategies, ambitions and options available to achieve the Paris goals. 

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are the primary tools for quantitatively evaluating the technological 
and  macro-economic  implications  of  decarbonisation,  particularly  for  global  long-term  pathways.  They 
broadly divide into ‘stylized aggregate benefit-cost models’, and more complex, ‘detailed process’ IAMs 
(Weyant 2017), often mirroring the benefit-cost and cost-effective approaches outlined in 1.7.1, with more 
detailed  classification  in  eg.  Nikas  et  al.  (2019).  IAMs  embody  a  number  of  structural  and  socio-
demographic assumptions and include multiple modelling approaches, ranging from economic optimising 
behaviour to simulation (See Annex III). Detailed process models can include energy system models used 
to analyse decarbonisation and ‘net zero’ scenarios by international agencies (eg. IEA 2020a). 

Calculating cost-effective trajectories towards given goals typically involves detailed process IAMs. Often 
these calculate the dynamic portfolio of technologies consistent with a given climate target.  Some track 
records of technology forecasting in IAMs are outlined in Chapters 2.5.4, and Box 16.1. Climate targets 
may be imposed in models in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, constraints on emissions 
or cumulated emissions (carbon budgets), and the pricing of emissions. The time-path of mitigation costs 
calculated through these models may be translated into ‘shadow prices’ that (like the social-cost-of-carbon) 
offer  a  benchmark  to  assess  the  cost-effectiveness  of  investments,  as  used  by  some  governments  and 
companies (1.8.2).  

Scenarios in the IPCC and AR6. For AR6, WG III received submissions of more than 2500 model-based 
scenarios published in the scientific literature. Such scenarios, which explore different possible evolutions 
of future energy and land use (with or without climate policy) and associated emissions, are made available

through an interactive AR6 scenario database. The main characteristics of pathways in relation to ‘net zero’ 
emissions  and  remaining  ‘carbon  budgets’  are  summarised  in  Box  3.5  in  Chapter  3.  The  warming 
contribution of CO2 is very closely related to cumulative CO2 emissions, but the remaining ‘carbon budget’ 
for a given warming depends strongly inter alia on emissions of other GHGs; for targets below 2°C this 
may affect the corresponding ‘carbon budget’ by c. +/- 220GtCO2, compared to central estimates of around 
500GtCO2 (for 1.5°C) and 1350GtCO2 (for 2°C) (AR6 WGI, Table SPM.2; Cross-Working Group Box 1 
in Chapter 3).  

Pathways and ‘net zero’. The date at which the world needs aggregate emissions to reach net zero for Paris-
consistent temperature goals depends both on progress in reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions and near-term 
progress in reducing CO2 emissions. Faster progress in the near term extends the date at which  net zero 
must be reached, while conversely, slower near-term progress brings the date even closer to the present. 
Some of the modelled 1.5°C pathways with limited overshoot cut global CO2 emissions in half until 2030, 
which allows for a more gradual decline thereafter, reaching net zero CO2 after 2050; also, net zero GHGs 
occurs later, with remaining emissions of some non-CO2 GHGs compensated by ‘net negative’ CO2 (see 
Annex I and FAQ 1.3, and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3).  

Drawing from the scenarios database, five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways’ (IMPs) were defined for this 
report (Figure 3.5 in Chapter 3 and Table 1.1). These are introduced here, with a more complete description 
and discussion provided in Section 3.2.5 of Chapter 3. These IMPs were chosen to illustrate key themes 
with respect to mitigation strategies across the entire WG III assessment. The IMPs embody both a storyline, 
which describes in narrative form the key socio-economic characteristics of that scenario, and a quantitative 
illustration providing numerical values that are internally consistent and comparable across chapters of this 
report.  Quantitative  IMPs  can  be  associated  directly  with  specific  human  activities  and  provide  a 
quantitative point of reference that links activities in different parts of socioeconomic systems. Some parts 
of the report draw on these quantitative scenarios, whilst others use only the narratives. No assessment of 
the likelihood of each IMP has been made (as they reflect both human choice and deep uncertainty).

Figure 1.3 Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) used in AR6 – illustration of key features and levels of 

ambition 

The IMPs are organized around two dimensions: the level of ambition consistent with meeting Paris goals 
and  the  scenario  features  (Figure  1.4).  The  IMPs  explore  different  pathways  potentially  consistent  with 
meeting the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. As detailed in Section 3.2.5 of Chapter 3 
and Chapter 4, a pathway of Gradual Strengthening of current policies (IMP-GS) to 2030, if followed by 
very  fast  reductions,  may  stay  below  2C.  The  IMP-NEG  pathway,  with  somewhat  deeper  emission 
cutbacks  to  2030,  might  enable  1.5C  to  be  reached  but  only  after  significant  overshoot,  through  the 
subsequent  extensive  use  of  CDR  in  the  energy  and  the  industry  sectors  to  achieve  net  negative  global 
emissions, as discussed in Chapters 3, 12, 7, 6, and 10.  

Three other IMPs illustrate different features of technology scenarios with more short term rapid emission 
reductions, which could deliver outcomes compatible with the temperature range in the Paris agreement 
without large overshoot. Based on the assessment in Section 5.3.3 of Chapter 5, one key mitigation strategy 
would be to rely on the opportunities for reducing demand (IMP-LD). Chapter 6 and the Chapter 7-11 show 
how energy systems based on accelerated deep renewable energy penetration and electrification can also 
provide  a  pathway  to  deep  mitigation  (IMP-REN).  Chapter  4,  17  and  3  provide  insights  how  shifting 
development pathways can lead to deep emission reductions and achieve sustainable development goals 
(IMP-SP). 

These pathways can be implemented with different levels of ambition, that can be measured through the 
classes  (C)  of  temperature  levels  from  the  scenarios  database,  see  Chapter  3  (Table  3.2).  In  the  IMP 
framework, Section 3.2.5 in Chapter 3 presents and explores quantitative scenarios that can limit warming 
to 1.5 °C (with a probability of 50% or greater, i.e., C1 for the illustrated quantification of LD, SP and REN, 
and  C2  for  NEG  scenario),  along  with  others  GS  pathway  which  keeps  warming  below  2oC  with  a 
probability of 67% or greater (C3). In addition to these primary IMPs, the full scenario database contains 
sensitivity cases that explore alternative warming levels.  

In addition to the IMPs two additional scenarios were selected, which illustrate the consequences of current 
policies and pledges. Current Policies (CurPol) explores the consequences of continuing along the path of 
implemented climate policies in 2020 and only a gradual strengthening after that, drawing on numerous 
such scenarios in the literature. Moderate Action (ModAct) explores the impact of implementing NDCs to 
2030, but without further strengthening; both results in global mean temperature above 2oC. They provide 
benchmarks against which to compare the IMPs. 

Table 1.1 summarises the main storyline elements of the reference scenarios and each IMP.

What  the  IMPs  do  and  don’t  do. The  IMPs  are,  as  their  name  implies,  a  set  of scenarios meant  to 
illustrate some important themes that run through the entire WGIII assessment. They illustrate that the 
climate outcomes that the individuals and society will face in the century ahead depend on individual 
and societal choices In addition, they illustrate that there are multiple ways to successful achievement 
of Paris long-term temperature goals. 

IMPs are not intended to be comprehensive. They are not intended to illustrate all possible themes in 
this  report.  They  do  not,  for  example  attempt  to  illustrate  the  range  of  alternative  socioeconomic 
pathways against which efforts to implement Paris goals may be set, or to reflect variations in potential 
regional  development  pathways.  They  do  not  explore  issues  around  income  distribution  or 
environmental justice, but assume implicitly that where and how action occurs can be separated from 
who pays, in ways to adequately address such issues. They are essentially pathways of technological 
evolution and demand shifts reflecting broad global trends in social choice. The IMPs do not directly 
assess issues of realization linked to the “drivers and constraints” summarized in our previous section, 
and  the  quantifications  use,  for  the  most  part,  models  that  are  grounded  mainly  in  the  Aggregate 
Economics Frameworks (section 7.1). As such they reflect primarily the geophysical, economic and 
technological Dimensions of Assessment, but can be assessed in relation to the full set of Feasibility 
criteria (section 1.8.1).  

Together the IMPs provide illustrations of potential future developments that can be shaped by human 
choices, including: Where are current policies and pledges leading? What is needed to reach specific 
temperature goals under varying assumptions? What are the consequences of different strategies to meet 
climate targets (i.e. demand-side strategy, a renewable energy strategy or a strategy with a role for net 
negative emissions)? What are the consequences of delay? What are the implications for other SDGs of 
various climate mitigation pathways?  

 

1.6  Achieving mitigation in the context of sustainable development 

This chapter now sets out approaches to understanding the mitigation challenge, working from its broad 
location  in  the  context  of  wider  aspirations  for  sustainable  development,  then  identifying  specific 
analytic approaches, before summarising the corresponding main dimensions used for assessment of 
options and pathways in much of the report.  

1.6.1  The Climate Change and Development Connection  

Climate  change  mitigation  is  one  of  many  goals  that  societies  pursue  in  the  context  of  sustainable 
development, as evidenced by the wide range of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Climate 
change  and  sustainable  development  as  well  as  development  more  broadly,  are  interwoven  along 
multiple and complex lines of relationship (Fankhauser 2016; Gomez-Echeverri 2018a; Okereke and 
Massaquoi 2017; Okereke et al. 2009), as highlighted in several previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2007, 
2019a, 2018b, 2011a, 2014a). With its significant negative impact on natural systems, food security and 
infrastructure, loss of lives and territories, species extinction, conflict health, among several other risks, 
climate change poses a serious threat to development and wellbeing in both rich and poor countries 
(IPCC 2019b, 2018b, 2007, 2011a, 2014a).  Without serious efforts at mitigation and adaptation, climate 
change could push millions further into poverty and limit the opportunities for economic development 
(Chapter 4 and 17). It follows that ambitious climate mitigation is necessary to secure a safe climate 
within which development and wellbeing can be pursued and sustained.  

At the same time, rapid and largescale economic development (which has in the past driven climate 
change through land use change and dependence on fossil fuels), is widely seen as needed to improve 
global  wellbeing  and  lift  millions  especially  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries  out  of  poverty 
(Baarsch et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2019; Mugambiwa and Tirivangasi 2017; Chen et al. 2017; See Figure

1.6).  This  strand  of  literature  emphasises the importance  of economic  growth including  for tackling 
climate change itself, pointing to the relationship between economic development and climate resilience 
as well as the role of industry-powered technologies such as electric vehicles in reducing GHG levels 
and promoting wellbeing (Heinrichs et al. 2014; Kasztelan 2017). Yet, others argue that the character 
of social and economic development produced by the nature of capitalist society (Pelling and Manuel-
Navarrete 2011; Koch 2012; Malm 2016) is ultimately unsustainable.  

There  are  at  least  two  major  implications  of  the  very  close  link  between  climate  change  and 
development as outlined above. The first is that the choice of development paths made by countries and 
regions have significant consequences for GHG emissions and efforts to combat climate change (see 
Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 14). The second is that   climate mitigation at local, national and global level 
cannot be effectively achieved by a narrow focus on ‘climate-specific’ sectors, actors and policies; but 
rather  through  a  much  broader  attention  to  the  mix  of  development  choices  and  the  resulting 
development paths and trajectories (see Chapter 4, 6, 10; O’Neill et al. 2014).  

As a key staple of IPCC reports and global climate policy landscape (Gidden et al. 2019; Quilcaille et 
al. 2019; van Vuuren et al. 2017; IPCC 2014b, 2007; see also Chapter 2), integrated assessment models 
and global scenarios (such as the “Shared Socio-Economic Pathways” – SSPs) highlight the interaction 
between development paths, climate change and emission stabilisation (see Section 3.6 in Chapter 3). 
The close links are also recognised in the PA (section 1.3.1).  

The impact of climate change in limiting wellbeing is most acutely felt by the world’s poorest people, 
communities, and nations, who have the smallest carbon footprint, constrained capacity to respond and 
limited  voice  in  important  decision-making  circles  (Okereke  and  Ehresman  2015;  Tosam  and  Mbih 
2015;  Mugambiwa  and  Tirivangasi  2017).  The  wide  variation  in  the  contribution  to,  and  impact  of 
climate change within and across countries makes equity, inequality, justice, and poverty eradication, 
inescapable aspects of the relationship between sustainable development and climate change (Reckien 
et al. 2017; Okereke and Coventry 2016; Bos and Gupta 2019; Klinsky et al. 2017; Baarsch et al. 2020; 
Kayal et al. 2019; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). This underpins the conclusion as commonly expressed 
that climate action needs to be pursued in the context of sustainable development, equity and poverty 
eradication  (Burton  et  al.  2001;  Smit  et  al.  2001;  Klinsky  and  Winkler  2014;  Tschakert  and  Olsson 
2005; IPCC 2014a, 2018b).  

1.6.2  Concepts and frameworks for integrating climate mitigation and development:  

At one level, sustainable development can be seen as a meta framework for integrating climate action 
with other global sustainability goals (Antal and Van Den Bergh 2016; Casadio Tarabusi and Guarini 
2013).  Fundamentally,  the  concept  of  sustainable  development  underscores  the  interlinkages  and 
interdependence  of  human  and  natural  systems  and  the  need  to  balance  economic,  social,  and 
environmental  (including  climate  pollution)  aspects  in  development  planning  and  processes  (Nunan 
2017; Gomez-Echeverri 2018b; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019). 

Despite the appeal of the concept, tensions remain over the interpretation and practical application, with 
acute disagreements regarding what the balancing entails in real life, how to measure wellbeing, which 
goals to set, and the means through which such goals might be pursued (Michelsen et al. 2016; Shang 
et  al.  2019;  Okereke  and  Massaquoi  2017;  UNEP  2018b;  Arrow  et  al.  2011;  Dasgupta  et  al.  2015; 
Sugiawan et al. 2019; Haberl et al. 2019).  

Moreover, countries differ enormously in their respective situation regarding their development path – 
a condition which affects their capability, goals, priorities and approach to the pursuit of sustainability 
(Ramos-Mejía et al. 2018; Okereke et al. 2019; Shi et al. 2016).  Most of the literature recognises that 
despite its limitations, sustainable development with its emphasis on integrating social, economic and 
environmental goals, provides a more comprehensive approach to the pursuit of planetary health and

human wellbeing. Sustainable development is then not a static objective but a dynamic framework for 
measuring human progress (Costanza et al. 2016; Fotis and Polemis 2018), relevant for all countries 
even if different groups of nations experience the challenge of sustainability in different ways.    

Much  like  sustainable  development,  concepts  like  low-carbon  development  (Mulugetta  and  Urban 
2010; Yuan et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2019), climate-compatible development (CCD) 
(Mitchell and Maxwell 2010; Tompkins et al. 2013; Stringer et al. 2014; Bickersteth et al. 2017) and 
more recently climate-resilient development (CRD) (Fankhauser and McDermott 2015; Henly-Shepard 
et al. 2018) (see IPCC SR 1.5 2018b) have all emerged as ideas, tools and frameworks, intended to 
bring  together  the  goals of  climate  mitigation  and  the  SDGs,  as  well  as development more  broadly. 
Figure 1.5 suggests that the prospects for realizing a climate-resilient and equitable world is enhanced 
by a process of transformation and development trajectories that seek to limit global warming while 
also  achieving  the  SDGS.  The  SDGs  represent  medium-term  goals,  and  long-term  sustainability 
requires continued effort to keep the world along a climate resilient development path. A key feature of 
development or transformation pathways that achieve a climate resilient world is that they   maximise 
the synergies and minimise the trade-offs between climate mitigation and other sustainable development 
goals (Dagnachew et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Thornton and Comberti 2017; Wüstemann et al. 
2017; Mainali et al. 2018; Klausbruckner et al. 2016).  Crucially, the nature of trade-offs and timing of 
related  decisions  will  vary  across  countries  depending  on  circumstances  including  the  level  of 
development, capability and access to resources (see Cross-chapter Box 5, Shifting Development Paths 
to increase Sustainability, in Chapter 4).

Other  concepts  such  as  “Doughnut  Economics”  (Raworth  2018),  ecological  modernisation,  and 
mainstreaming are also used to convey ideals of development pathways that take sustainability, climate 
mitigation,  and  environmental  limits  seriously  (Dale  et  al.  2015a).  Mainstreaming  focuses  on

incorporating climate change into national development activities, such as the building of infrastructure 
(Wamsler and Pauleit 2016; Runhaar et al. 2018). The ‘green economy’ and green growth  – growth 
without undermining ecological systems, partly by gaining economic value from cleaner technologies 
and systems and is inclusive and equitable in its outcomes - has gained popularity in both developed 
and  developing  countries  as  an  approach  for  harnessing  economic  growth  to  address  environmental 
issues (Bina 2013; Georgeson et al. 2017; Capasso et al. 2019; Song et al. 2020; Hao et al. 2021). Critics 
however argue that green economy ultimately emphasises economic growth to the detriment of other 
important aspects of human welfare such as social justice (Adelman 2015; Death 2014; Kamuti 2015), 
and challenge the central idea that it is possible to decouple economic activity and growth (measured 
as GDP increment) from increasing use of biophysical resources (raw materials, energy) (Jackson and 
Victor 2019; Parrique et al. 2019; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Haberl et al. 2020; Vadén et al. 2020). 

Literature on degrowth, post growth, and post development questions the sustainability and imperative 
of more growth especially in already industrialised countries and argues that prosperity and the ‘Good 
Life’  are  not  immutably  tied  to  economic  growth  (Escobar  2015;  Asara  et  al.  2015;  Kallis  2019; 
Latouche 2018; see also Section 5.2.1 in Chapter 5). The concept of ‘just transition’ also stresses the 
need to  integrate justice  concerns so  as to not  impose  hardship  on  already  marginalised  populations 
within  and  between  countries    (Goddard  and  Farrelly  2018;  Smith,  Jackie  and  Patterson  2018; 
McCauley and Heffron 2018; Evans and Phelan 2016; Heffron and McCauley 2018; see section 1.7.2). 
The key insight is that pursuing climate goals in the context of sustainable development requires holistic 
thinking  including  on  how  to  measure  well-being,  serious  consideration  of  the  notion  of  ecological 
limits,  at  least  some  level  of  decoupling  and  certainly  choices  and  decision-making  approaches  that 
exploit and maximise the synergy and minimises the trade-off between climate mitigation and other 
sustainable development goals. It also requires consideration of equity and justice within and between 
countries.  However, ideas of a synergistic relationship between development and climate mitigation 
can sometimes offer limited practical guidelines for reconciling the tensions that are often present in 
practical policy making (Dale et al. 2015b; Ferguson et al. 2014; Kasztelan 2017; Kotzé 2018).  

1.6.3  Climate Mitigation, Equity and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)   

Climate action can be conceptualised as both a stand-alone and cross-cutting issue in the 2030 SDGs 
(Makomere and Liti Mbeva 2018), given that several of the other goals such as ending poverty (Goal 
1), zero hunger (Goal 2), good health and wellbeing (Goal 3), affordable and clean energy (Goal 7) 
among many others are related to climate change (see Figure 3.39 in Chapter 3).  

In  addition  to  galvanising  global  collective  action,  the  SDGs  provide  concrete  themes,  targets  and 
indicators for measuring human progress to sustainability (Kanie and Biermann 2017). The SDGs also 
provide a basis for exploring the synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development and climate 
change  mitigation  (Makomere  and  Liti  Mbeva  2018;  Mainali  et  al.  2018;  Fuso  Nerini  et  al.  2018; 
Pradhan et al. 2017).  Progress to date (Sachs et al. 2016) shows fulfilling SDGs is a challenge for all 
groups of countries – developed and developing – even though the challenge differs between countries 
and regions (Pradhan et al. 2017). 

Historically,  the  industrialisation  associated  with  economic  development  has  involved  a  strong 
relationship with GHG emissions (see Section 5.2.1 in Chapter 5). Figure 1.6 shows per capita GHG 
emissions on the vertical axis and Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) levels (Prados de 
la Escosura 2015) on the horizontal axis.7 The grey line shows historic global average GHG emissions

per  capita  and  levels  of  human  development  over  time,  from  1870  to  2014.  The  current  position  of 
different regions are shown by bubbles, with sizes representing total GHG emissions. Figure 1.6 also 
shows  the  estimated  position  of  the  SDGs  zone  for  the  year  2030,  and  a  “sustainable  development 
corridor” as countries reach towards higher HDI and lower emissions.  To fulfil the SDGs, including 
SDG 13 climate action, the historic relationship needs to change.  

The  top  of  the  SDG  zone  is  situated  around the  global  per  capita  GHG  emissions  level  of  5 tonnes 
CO2eq required for the world to be path towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement.8 The horizontal position 
of the SDG zone is estimated based on the HIHD levels (Prados de la Escosura 2015) of countries that 
have been shown to either have achieved, or have some challenges, when it comes to SDG 3, SDG 4 
and SDG 8 (Sachs et al. 2016); as these SDGs are related to the constituent parts of the HIHD. Beyond 
2030, the sustainable development corridor allows for increasing levels of human development while 
lowering per capita GHG emissions. 

Figure 1.6 shows that at present, regions with HIHD levels of around 0.5 all have emissions at or above 
about 5tCO2eq per-capita (even more so on a consumption footprint basis, see Figure 1.1c,d), but there 
are wide variations within this. Indeed, there are regions with HIHD levels above 0.8 which have GHG 
per-capita  emissions  lower  than  several  with  HIHD  levels  of  around  0.5.  The  mitigation  challenge 
involves countries at many different stages of development seeking paths towards higher welfare with 
low emissions. 

From Figure 1.6, there are two distinct dimensions to sustainable development pathways for fulfilling 
the SDGs. In terms of per-capita GHG emissions (the vertical), some regions have such low levels that 
they could increase and still be below the global average  required in 2030 for the world to be on path 
to  fulfil  the  Paris  Agreement.  Meanwhile  other  regions  with  high  per  capita  GHG  emissions  would 
require a rapid transformation in technologies and practices. It is against this background that  Dubash 
(2019)  emphasises  placing  the  need  for  urgent  action  on  climate  change  in  the  context  of  domestic 
political priorities and the institutions within which national frameworks are crystallised. 

Concerns over equity in the context of growing global inequality and very tight remaining global carbon 
budgets  have motivated an emphasis on equitable access to sustainable development (Peters et al. 2015; 
Kartha et al. 2018b; Matthews et al. 2019; van den Berg et al. 2019). This literature emphasises  the 
need for less developed countries to have sufficient room for development while addressing climate 
change  (Pan et al. 2014; Winkler et al. 2013; Gajevic Sayegh 2017; Warlenius 2018; Robinson and 
Shine  2018).  Meanwhile,  many  countries  reliant  on  fossil  fuels,  related  technologies  and  economic 
activities  are  eager  to  ensure  tax  revenues  are  maintained,  workers  and  industries  have  income  and 
justice is embedded in the economic transformations required to limit GHG emissions  (Cronin et al. 
2021).

 

schooling  of  children,  the  mean  years  of  schooling  of  the  adult  population,  and  GNI  per  capita  adjusted  for 
purchasing power; the HIHD is based on: life expectancy at birth, adult literacy rates, educational enrolment rates, 
and GDP per capita, and is used in Figure 1.6 because it is available for a longer time series (Prados de la Escosura 
2015).

Figure 1.5: Sustainable development pathways towards fulfilling the SDGs. 

The graph shows global average per capita GHG emissions (vertical axis) and relative "Historic Index of 
Human Development" (HIHD) levels (horizonal) have increased globally since the industrial revolution 
(grey line). The bubbles on the graph show regional per capita GHG emissions and human development 

levels in the year 2015, illustrating large disparities. Pathways towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement 

(and SDG 13) involve global average per capita GHG emissions below about 5 tCO2e by 2030. Likewise, 
to fulfil SDGs 3, 4 and 8, HIHD levels (see footnote 7) need to be at least 0.5 or greater. This suggests a 
‘sustainable development zone’ for year 2030 (in green); the in-figure text also suggests a sustainable 

development corridor, where countries limit per capita GHG emissions while improving levels of human 
development over time.  The emphasis of pathways into the sustainable development zone differ (green 

arrows) but in each case transformations are needed in how human development is attained while 

limiting GHG emissions.

Correlation between CO2 emission intensity, or absolute emission and gross domestic product growth, 
is not rigid, unambiguous and deterministic (Ojekunle et al. 2015), but the extent to which SDGs and 
economic  growth  expectations  can  be  fulfilled  while decoupling  GHG  emissions  remains  a  concern 
(Hickel  and  Kallis  2020;  Haberl  et  al.  2020).  Below  some  thresholds  of  absolute  poverty,  more 
consumption  is  necessary  for  development  to  lead  to  well-being  (see  Section  5.2.1.1  in  Chapter  5), 
which  may  not  be  the  case  at  higher  levels  of  consumption  (Steinberger  et  al.  2020;  Lamb  and 
Steinberger 2017; Section 1.7.2). 

In conclusion, achieving climate stabilisation in the context of sustainable development and efforts to 
eradicate  poverty  requires  collective  action  and  exploiting  synergies  between  climate  action  and 
sustainable development, while minimising the impact of trade-offs (Najam 2005; Makomere and Liti 
Mbeva  2018;  Okereke  and  Massaquoi  2017;  Dooley  et  al.  2021).  It  also  requires  a  focus  on  equity 
considerations to avoid climate induced harm, as well as unfairness that can result from urgent actions 
to cut emissions (Kartha et al. 2018a; Robiou du Pont et al. 2017; Pan et al. 2014). This is ever more 
important as the diminishing carbon budget has intensified debates on which countries should have the 
greatest claim to the ‘remaining space’ for emissions (Raupach et al. 2014) or production (McGlade 
and  Ekins  2015),amplified  by  persistent  concerns  over  the  insufficiency  of  support  for  means  of 
implementation, to support ambitious mitigation efforts (Pickering et al. 2015; Weikmans and Roberts 
2019).  

 

1.7   Four  Analytic  Frameworks  for  understanding  mitigation  response 

strategies  

Climate  change  is  unprecedented  in  its  scope  (sectors,  actors  and  countries),  depth  (major 
transformations) and timescales (over generations). As such, it creates unique challenges for analysis. 
It  has  been  called  “the  greatest  market  failure  in  history”  (Stern  2007);  the  Perfect  Moral  Storm 
(Gardiner 2006) and a “super wicked problem” (Lazarus 2009; Levin et al. 2012) -  one which appears 
difficult to solve through the traditional tools and assumptions of social organisation and analysis.   

To  complement  the  extensive  literature  on  risks  and  decision-making  under  uncertainty  reviewed in 
AR6-WGII (notably, Chapter 19), this section summarises insights and developments in key analytic 
frameworks and tools particularly relevant to understanding specific mitigation strategies, policies and 
other actions, including explaining the observed if limited progress to date. Organised partly as reflected 
in the quotes above, these include aggregated (principally, economic) frameworks to evaluate system-
level  choices;  ethical  perspectives  on  values  and  equity  including  stages  of  development  and 
distributional concerns; and transition frameworks which focus on the processes and actors involved in 
major technological and social transitions. These need to be complemented by a fourth set of approaches 
which shine more light on psychological/behavioural and political factors. All these frameworks are 
relevant, and together they point to the multiple perspectives and actions required if the positive drivers 
of  emission  reduction  summarised  in  section  4  are  to  outweigh  the  barriers  and  overcome  the 
constraints.  

1.7.1  Aggregated approaches: economic efficiency and global dynamics of mitigation  

Some  of  the  most  established  and  influential  approaches  to  understand  aggregate  causes  and 
consequences  of  climate  change  and  mitigation  across  societies,  draw  upon  economic  theories  and 
modelling to generate global emission pathways in the absence of climate policies (a reference) and to 
study alternative mitigation pathways (described in detail in Section 3.2.5 in Chapter 3). The underlying 
economic  concepts  aggregate  wealth  or  other  measures  of  welfare  based  on  utilitarian  ethical

foundations, and in most applications, a number of additional assumptions detailed in AR5 (Chapters 2 
and 3).  

1.7.1.1  Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis 

Such  global  aggregate  economic  studies  coalesce  around  two  main  questions.  One,  as  pioneered  by 
Nordhaus  (1992; 2008) attempts to monetize overall  climate damages and mitigation costs so as to 
strike a ‘cost-benefit optimum’ pathway. More detailed and empirically-grounded ‘cost-effectiveness 
analysis’ explores pathways that would minimise mitigation costs (IPCC 2014a section 2.5; Ekholm 
2014; Weyant 2017) for given targets (e.g. as agreed in international negotiations, see Section 3.2 in 
Chapter 3). Both approaches recognise that resources are limited, and climate change competes with 
other priorities in government policymaking, and are generally examined with some form of Integrated 
Assessment Model (IAMs: see 1.5, and Appendix C). Depending on the regional disaggregation of the 
modelling  tools  used  and  on  the  scope  of  the  analyses,  these  studies  may  or  may  not  address 
distributional aspects within and across nations associated with climate policies (Bauer et al. 2020).  

For  at  least  10-15  years  after  the  first  computed  global  cost-benefit  estimate  (Nordhaus  1992),  the 
dominant conclusions from these different approaches seemed to yield very different recommendations, 
with  cost-benefit  studies  suggesting  lenient  mitigation  compared  to  the  climate  targets  typically 
recommended from scientific risk assessments (Weyant 2017). Over the past 10-15 years, literature has 
made important strides towards reconciling these two approaches, both in the analytic methods and the 
conclusions arising.  

Damages and risks Incorporating impacts which may be extremely severe but are uncertain (known as 
“fat tails” (Weitzman 2009, 2011), strengthens the economic case for ambitious action to avoid risks of 
extreme climate impacts (Ackerman et al. 2010; Dietz and Stern 2015; Fankhauser et al. 2013). The 
salience  of  risks  has  also  been  amplified  by  improved  understanding  of  climate  ‘tipping  points’ 
(Lontzek et al. 2015; Lenton et al. 2019); valuations should reflect that cutting emissions reduces not 
only average expected damages, but also the risk of catastrophic events (IWG 2021). 

Discounting. The role of time-discounting, in weighting future climate change impacts against today’s 
costs  of  mitigating  emissions,  has  been  long  recognised  (Weitzman  1994,  2001;  Nordhaus  2007; 
Dasgupta 2008; Stern 2007). Its importance is underlined in analytical Integrated Assessment Models 
(IAMs) (Golosov et al. 2014; van der Ploeg and Rezai 2019; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016); also Annex 
III. Economic literature suggests applying risk-free, public, and long-term interest rates when evaluating 
overall  climate  strategy  (Arrow  et  al.  2013;  Groom  and  Hepburn  2017;  Weitzman  2001;  Dasgupta 
2008). Expert elicitations indicate values around 2% (majority) to 3% (Drupp et al. 2018). This is lower 
than in many of the studies reviewed in earlier IPCC Assessments, and many IAM studies since, and 
by  increasing  the  weight  accorded  to  the  future  would  increase  current  ‘optimal  effort’.    The  U.S. 
Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon used 3% as its central value (IAWG 2016; 
Li and Pizer 2018; Adler et al. 2017). Individual projects may require specific risk adjustments.  

Distribution of impacts. The economic damages from climate change at the nationally aggregated and 
subnational level are very diverse (Moore et al. 2017; Ricke et al. 2018; Carleton et al. 2020). A 'global 
damage function’ necessarily implies aggregating impacts across people and countries with different 
levels of income, and over generations, a process which obscures the strategic considerations that drive 
climate policy making (Keohane and Oppenheimer 2016). Economics acknowledges there is no single, 
objectively-defined such ‘social welfare function’ (IPCC 1995, 2014a). This applies also to distribution 
of responses; both underline the relevance of equity (next section) and global negotiations to determine 
national and collective objectives.

ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITSFinal Government Distribution                               Chapter 1 

                             IPCC AR6 WGIII 

 

Obvious limitations arise from these multiple difficulties in assessing an objective, globally-acceptable 
single estimate of climate change damages (e.g. Pindyck 2013; Arrow et al. 2013; Auffhammer 2018; 
Stern et al. 2021), with some arguing that agreement on a specific value can never be expected (Rosen 
and Guenther 2015; Pezzey 2018).  A new generation of cost-benefits analysis, based on projections of 
actual observed damages, result in stronger mitigation efforts as optimal (Glanemann et al. 2020; Hänsel 
et al. 2020). Overall the combination of improved damage functions with the wider consensus on low 
discount rates (as well as lower mitigation costs due to innovation) has increasingly yielded ‘optimal’ 
results from benefit-cost studies in line with the range established in the Paris Agreement (see Cross-
Working-Group Box 1 in Chapter 3).   

Hybrid  cost-benefit  approaches  that  extend  the  objective  of  the  optimisation  beyond  traditional 
welfare,  adding some form of temperature targets as in (Llavador et al. 2015; Held 2019) also represent 
a step in bridging the gap between the two approaches and result in proposed strategies much more in 
line with those coming from the cost-effectiveness literature. Approaching from the opposite side, cost-
effectiveness studies have looked into incorporating benefits from avoided climate damages, to improve 
the assessment of net costs (Drouet et al. 2021).  

Cost-benefit  IAMs  utilise  damage  functions  to  derive  a  social  cost  of  CO2  emissions’  (SCC  -  the 
additional cost to society of a pulse of CO2 emissions). One review considered “the best estimate” of 
the optimal [near-term] level “still ranges from a few tens to a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon 
(Tol 2018)”, with various recent studies in the hundreds, taking account of risks (Taconet et al. 2019), 
learning  (Ekholm  2018)  and  distribution  (Ricke  et  al.  2018).    In  addition  to  the  importance  of 
uncertainty/risk, aggregation, and realistic damage functions as noted, on which some progress has been 
made,  some  reviews  additionally  critique  how  IAMs  represent  abatement  costs  in  terms  of  energy 
efficiency and innovation (e.g. Rosen and Guenther 2015; Farmer et al. 2015; Keen 2021); see also 
1.7.3 and 1.7.4. IAMs may better reflect associated ‘rebound’ at system level  (Saunders et al. 2021), 
and  inefficient  implementation  would  raise  mitigation  costs  (Homma  et  al.  2019);  conversely,  co-
benefits – most extensively estimated for air-quality, valued at a few tens of USD/tCO2 across sixteen 
studies (Karlsson et al. 2020) - complement global with additional local benefits (see alsoTable 1.2).   

Whereas many of these factors affect primarily cost-benefit evaluation, discounting also determines the 
cost-effective  trajectory:  Emmerling  et  al.  (2019)  find  that,  for  a  remaining  budget  of  1000GtCO2, 
reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% would more than double current efforts, limit ‘overshoot’, 
greatly reduce a late rush to negative emissions, and improve intergenerational justice by more evenly 
distributing policy costs across the 21st century. 

1.7.1.2  Dynamic efficiency and uncertainty 

Care is required to clarify what is optimised (Dietz and Venmans 2019). Optimising a path towards a 
given temperature goal by a fixed date (e.g. 2100) gives time-inconsistent results backloaded to large, 
last-minute investment in carbon dioxide removal. ‘Cost-effective’ optimisations generate less initial 
effort  than  equivalent  cost-benefit  models  (Gollier  2021;  Dietz  and  Venmans  2019)  as  they  do  not 
incorporate benefits of reducing impacts earlier.  

 ‘Efficient pathways’ are affected by inertia and innovation. Inertia implies amplifying action on long-
lived investments and infrastructure that could otherwise lock in emissions for many decades  (Vogt-
Schilb et al. 2018; Baldwin et al. 2020). Chapter 3 (section 3.5) discusses interactions between near, 
medium and long-term actions in global pathways, particularly vis-à-vis inertia. Also, to the extent that 
early  action  induces  low  carbon  innovation,  it  ‘multiplies’  the  optimal  effort  (for  given  damage 
assumptions), because it facilitates subsequent cheaper abatement. For example, a ‘learning-by-doing'

ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITSFinal Government Distribution                               Chapter 1

analysis concludes that early deployment of expensive PV was of net global economic benefit, due to 
induced innovation (Newbery 2018). 

Research  thus  increasingly  emphasises  the  need  to  understand  climate  transformation  in  terms  of 
dynamic,  rather  than  static,  efficiency  (Gillingham  and  Stock  2018).  This  means  taking  account  of 
inertia, learning and various additional sources of ‘path-dependence’. Including induced innovation in 
stylised IAMs can radically change the outlook (Acemoglu et al. 2012, 2016), albeit with limitations 
(Pottier et al. 2014); many more detailed-process IAMs now do include endogenous technical change 
(as reviewed in Yang et al. (2018) and Grubb et al. (2021b); also Annex III).  

These  dynamic  and  uncertainty  effects  typically  justify  greater  up-front  effort  (Kalkuhl  et  al.  2012; 
Bertram et al. 2015),  including accelerated international diffusion (Schultes et al. 2018), and strengthen 
optimal initial effort in cost-benefit models (Grubb et al. 2021b; Baldwin et al. 2020). Approaches to 
risk  premia  common  in  finance  would  similarly  amplify  the  initial  mitigation  effort,  declining  as 
uncertainties reduce (Daniel et al. 2019).  

1.7.1.3  Disequilibrium, complex systems and evolutionary approaches 

Other approaches to aggregate evaluation  draw  on  various  branches  of intrinsically non-equilibrium 
theories (e.g. Chang 2014). These including long-standing theories from the 1930s  (e.g. Schumpeter 
1934a;  Keynes  1936)  to  understand  situations  of  structurally  under-employed  resources,  potential 
financial  instabilities  (Minsky  1986),  and  related  economic  approaches  which  emphasise  time 
dimensions  (e.g.  recent  reviews  in  Legrand  and  Hagemann  2017;  Stern  2018).    More  recently 
developing have been formal economic theories of endogenous growth building on eg. Romer (1986), 
and  developments  of  Schumpeterian  creative  destruction  (Aghion  et  al.  2021)  and  evolutionary 
economic theories which abandon any notion of full or stable resource utilisation even as a reference 
concept (Nelson and  Winter  1982;  Freeman and  Perez  1988;  Carlsson  and  Stankiewicz  1991;  Perez 
2001; Freeman and Louçã 2001). 

The  latter  especially  are  technically  grounded  in  complex  system  theories  (e.g.  Arthur  1989,  1999; 
Beinhocker 2007; Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009). These take inherently dynamic views of economies 
as  continually  evolving  systems  with  continuously  unfolding  and  path-dependent  properties,  and 
emphasise uncertainty in contrast to any predictable or default optimality. Such approaches have been 
variously applied in policy evaluation  (Walton 2014; Moore et al. 2018), and specifically for global 
decarbonisation (e.g. Barker and Crawford-Brown 2014) using global simulation models. Because these 
have no natural reference ‘least lost’ trajectory, they illustrate varied and divergent pathways and tend 
to emphasise the diversity of possibilities and relevant policies, particularly linked to innovation and 
potentially ‘sensitive intervention points’ (Farmer et al. 2019; see also section 1.7.3). They also illustrate 
that different representations of innovation and financial markets together can explain why estimated 
impacts of mitigation on GDP can differ very widely (potentially even in sign), between different model 
types (Chapter 15, Section 15.6.3 and Box 15.7). 

1.7.2  Ethical approaches  

Gardiner's  (2011)  description  of  climate  change  as  ”The  Perfect  Moral  Storm”  identified  three 
‘tempests’.  Its  global  dimension,  in  a  world  of  sovereign  states  which  have  only  fragmentary 
responsibility and control, makes it ‘difficult to generate the moral consideration and necessary political 
will’. Its impacts are intergenerational but future generations have no voice in contemporary affairs, 
the  usual  mechanism  for  addressing  distributional  injustices,  amplified  by  the  intrinsic  inequity  of 
wealthy big emitters impacting particularly poorer victims. He argues that these are exacerbated by a 
third, theoretical failure to acknowledge a central need for ‘moral sensitivity, compassion, transnational 
and  transgenerational  care,  and  other  forms  of  ethical  concern  to  rise  to  the  surface’  to  help  guide

effective climate action.  As noted in section 1.4.6, however, equity and ethics are both a driver of and 
constraint on mitigation.  

1.7.2.1  Ethics and values  

A  large  body  of  literature  examines  the  critical  role  of  values,  ethics,  attitudes,  and  behaviours  as 
foundational  frames  for  understanding  and  assessing  climate  action,  sustainable  development  and 
societal transformation  (IPCC WGIII IPCC 2014a chapter 3). Most of this work is offered as a counter 
point  or  critique  to  mainstream  literature’s  focus  on  safe-guarding  of  economic  growth  of  nations, 
corporations and individuals (Castree 2017; Gunster 2017). These perspectives highlight the dominance 
of  economic  utilitarianism  in  western  philosophical  thought  as  a  key  driver  for  unsustainable 
consumption and global environmental change (Hoeing et al. 2015; Popescu 2016).  

Entrenching  alternative  values  that  promote  deep  decarbonisation,  environmental  conservation  and 
protection across all levels of society is then viewed as foundational component of climate resilient and 
sustainable development and for achieving human rights, and a safe climate world (Jolly et al. 2015; 
Evensen  2015;  Popescu  2016;  Tàbara  et  al.  2019).  The  UN  Human  Rights  Office  of  the  High 
Commissioner has highlighted the potentially crucial role of human rights in relation to climate change 
(UNHCR 2018). While acknowledging the role of policy, technology, and finance, the ‘managerialist’ 
approaches that emphasise ‘technical governance’ and fail to challenge the deeper values that underpin 
societies  may  not  secure  the  deep  change  required  to  avert  dangerous  climate  change  and  other 
environmental challenges (Hartzell-Nichols 2014; Steinberger et al. 2020). 

Social justice perspectives emphasise the distribution of responsibilities, rights, and mutual obligations 
between nations in navigating societal transformations (Patterson et al. 2018; Gawel and Kuhlicke 2017; 
Leach et al. 2018). Current approaches to climate action may fail to match what is required by science 
because they tend to circumvent constraints on human behaviour, especially constraints on economic 
interest and activity. Related literature explores  governance models that are centred on  environmental 
limits, planetary boundaries and the moral imperative to prioritise the poor in earth systems governance 
(Carley and Konisky 2020; Kashwan et al. 2020), with emphasis on trust and solidarity as foundations 
for  global  co-operation  on  climate  change  (Jolly  et  al.  2015).  A  key  obstacle  is  that  the  economic 
interests of states tend to be stronger than the drivers for urgent climate action (Bain 2017).  

Short-term interests of stakeholders is acknowledged to impede the reflection and deliberation needed 
for climate mitigation and adaptation planning (Hackmann 2016; Herrick 2018; Sussman et al. 2016; 
Schlosberg et al. 2017). Situationally appropriate mitigation and adaptation policies at both national 
and  international  level  may  require  more  ethical  self-reflection  (Herrick  2018),  including  self-
transcendent values such as universalism and benevolence, and moderation which are positively related 
to pro-environmental behaviours (Howell and Allen 2017; Jonsson and Nilsson 2014; Katz-Gerro et al. 
2015; Braito et al. 2017).  

Another strong theme in the literature concerns recognition of interdependence including the intimate 
relationship  between  humans  and  the  non-human  world  (Hannis  2016;  Gupta  and  Racherla  2018; 
Howell and Allen 2017), with such ecological interdependence offered as an organising principle for 
enduring transformation to sustainability.  A key policy implication of this is moving away from valuing 
nature only in market and monetary terms to strongly incorporating existential and non-material value 
of  nature  in  natural  resource  accounting  (Neuteleers  and  Engelen  2015;  Himes-Cornell  et  al.  2018; 
Shackleton  et  al.  2017).  There  has  been  increasing  attention  on  ways  to  design  climate  policy 
frameworks to help reconcile ecological virtue (with its emphasis on the collective) with and individual 
freedoms and personal autonomy (Kasperbauer 2016; Nash et al. 2017; Xiang et al. 2019). In such a 
framework,  moderation,  fairness,  and  stewardship  are  all  understood  and  promoted  as  directly

contributing  to the  ‘Good Life’.  Such approaches  are  deemed  vital  to counteract  tendencies  to  ‘free 
ride’, and to achieve behavioural changes often associated with tackling climate change (Section 5.2.1 
in Chapter 5).   

Some literature suggests that attention to emotions, especially with regards to climate communication, 
could help societies and individuals act in ways that focus less on monetary gain and more on climate 
and environmental sustainability (Bryck and Ellis 2016; Chapman et al. 2017; Nabi et al. 2018; Zummo 
et al. 2020).  

1.7.2.2  Equity and representation: international public choice across time and space  

Equity perspectives highlight three asymmetries relevant for climate change (Okereke 2017; Okereke 
and  Coventry  2016;  1.4.6).  Asymmetry  in  contribution  highlights  different  contributions  to  climate 
change both in historical and current terms, and apply both within and between states as well as between 
generations (Caney 2016; Heyward and Roser 2016). Asymmetry in impacts highlight the fact that the 
damages  will  be  borne  disproportionately  across  countries,  regions,  communities,  individuals  and 
gender; moreover, it is often those that have contributed the least that stand to bear the greatest impact 
of climate change (Shi et al. 2016; IPCC 2014a). Asymmetry in capacity highlights differences of power 
between groups and nations to participate in climate decision and governance, including capacity to 
implement mitigation and adaptation measures.  

If attention is not paid to equity, efforts designed to tackle climate change may end up exacerbating 
inequities among communities and between countries (Heffron and McCauley 2018). The implication 
is that to be sustainable in the long run, mitigation involves a central place for consideration of justice, 
both  within  and  between  countries  (Chapters  4,  14).  Arguments  that  the  injustices  following  from 
climate change are symptomatic of a more fundamental structural injustice in social relations, are taken 
to imply a need to address the deeper inequities within societies (Routledge et al. 2018). 

Climate change and climate policies affect countries and people differently, with the poor likely to be 
more affected (1.6.1). Ideas of ‘just transition’ (outlined in 1.8.2.) often have a national focus in the 
literature, but also imply that mitigation should not increase the asymmetries between rich and poor 
countries, implying a desire for transitions which seek reduce (or at least avoid adverse) distributional 
affects. Thus, it comes into play in the timing of zero emissions (chapter 3 and 14). International climate 
finance in which rich countries finance mitigation and adaptation in poor countries is also essential for 
reducing the asymmetries between rich and poor countries (1.6.3 and chapter 15). 

Equity across generations also matters, i.e., the distribution between the present and future generations. 
One aspect is discounting (1.7.1). Another approach has been to study the burdens on each generation 
following from the transition to low-carbon economies (IPCC 2014a chapter 3, Cross Working Group 
Box 3 in Chapter 12). Suggestions include shifting more investments into ‘natural capital’, so that future 
generations will inherit less physical capital but a better environment, or financing mitigation efforts 
today using governmental debt redeemed by future generations (Broome 2012; Heijdra et al. 2006; Karp 
and Rezai 2014; Hoel et al. 2019).  

1.7.3  Transition and transformation processes 

This report uses the term transition as the process, and transformation as the overall change or outcome, 
of large-scale shifts in technological, economic and social systems, called socio-technical systems in 
the  innovation  literature.  Typically,  new  technologies,  ideas  and  associated  systems  initially  grow 
slowly in absolute terms, but may then ‘take-off’ in a phase of exponential growth as they emerge from 
a position of niche into mainstream diffusion, as indicated by the ‘S-curve’ growth in Figure 1.7 (lower 
panel).  These  dynamics arise  from  interactions  between  innovation  (in technologies,  companies  and

Kramer 2018). Consequently, interdisciplinary perspectives are needed (Turnheim et al. 2015; Geels et 
al.  2016;  Hof  et  al.  2020).  Beyond  aggregated  economic  perspectives  on  dynamics  (1.7.1.2),  these 
emphasise the multiple actors and processes involved.

emerge from niches into an S-shape dynamic of exponential growth. The diffusion stage often involves 

new infrastructure and reconfiguration of existing market and regulatory structures (known in the 

literature as the “socio-technical regime”). During the phase of more widespread diffusion; growth levels 

off to linear, then slows as the industry and market matures. The processes displace incumbent

literatures identify three main levels with different characteristics, most generally termed micro, meso 
and macro. Transitions can be accelerated by policies appropriately targeted, which may be similarly 
grouped and sequenced (upper panel) in terms of corresponding three pillars of policy (Section 1.7.3); 

generally all are relevant, but their relative importance differs according to stage of the transition.  

 

Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) frameworks (chapter 16.4) focus on processes and policies of 
early innovation and ‘emergence’, which combine experimentation and commercialisation, involving 
Strategic Niche Management (Rip and Kemp 1998; Geels and Raven 2006). Literatures on the wider 
processes of transition highlight different stages (eg. Cross-Chapter box 12 in Chapter 16) and scales 
across three main levels, most generally termed micro, meso and macro (Rotmans et al. 2001).  

The  widely-used  ‘Multi-Level  Perspective’  or  MLP  (Geels  2002)  identifies  the  meso-level  as  the 
established  ‘socio-technical  (ST)  regime’,  an  set  of  interrelated  sub-systems  which  define  rules  and 
regulatory structures around existing  technologies and practices. The micro level is an ecosystem of 
varied niche alternatives, and overlaying the ST regime is a macro ‘landscape’ level. Transitions often 
start with niche alternatives (Köhler et al. 2019; Grin et al. 2010), which may break through to wider 
diffusion (second stage in Figure 1.8), especially if external landscape developments ‘create pressures 
on the regime that lead to cracks, tensions and windows of opportunity’ (Geels 2010; Rotmans et al. 
2001); an example is climate change putting sustained pressure on current regimes of energy production 
and consumption (Kuzemko et al. 2016). There are continual interactions between landscape, regime 
and niches, with varied implications for Transition Management (Loorbach 2010; Rotmans et al. 2001).   

In  contrast  to  standard  economic  metrics  of  marginal  or  smooth  change  (e.g.  elasticities),  transition 
theories  emphasise  interdisciplinary  approaches  and  the  non-linear  dynamics,  social,  economic  and 
environmental aspects of transitions to sustainability (Köhler et al. 2018; Cherp et al. 2018).  This may 
explain persistent tendencies to underestimate the exponential pace of change now being observed in 
renewable electricity (Chapters 2, 6) and emerging in mobility (Chapter 10). 

Recent decades have seen parallel broadening of economic perspectives and theories. Building also on 
the New Institutional Economics literatures (Williamson 2000), Grubb et al. (2015) classify these into 
three ‘domains of economic decision-making’ associated with different branches of economic theory, 
respectively (1) behavioural and organisational; (2) neoclassical and welfare, and (3) evolutionary and 
institutional.  Like  MLP,  these  are  related  to  different  social  and  temporal  scales,  as  applied  also  in 
studying  the  ‘adaptive  finance’  in  UK  electricity  transition  (Hall  et  al.  2017).  There  are  significant 
differences  but  these  approaches  all  point  to  understanding  the  characteristics  of  different  actors, 
notably, individuals/local actors; larger corporate organisations (public or private); and (mainly) public 
authorities, each with different decision-making characteristics.  

Sustainability may require purposeful actions at the different levels to foster the growth of sustainable 
technologies and practices, including support for niche alternatives (Grin et al. 2010). The middle level 
(established ‘socio-technical regime’) tends to resist major change, reforms generally involve pressures 
from  the  other  two  levels.  Thus,  transitions  can  be  accelerated  by  policies  appropriately  targeting 
relevant actors at the different levels (Köhler et al. 2019), the foundations for “three pillars of policy” 
(Grubb  et  al.  2014),  which  logically  evolve  in  the  course  of  transition  (Figure  2.6a).  Incumbent 
industries  have  to  adapt  if they  are to  thrive  within  the  growth  of  new  systems. Policy may  need to 
balance existing socio-technical systems with strategic investment and institutional development of the 
emerging niches (e.g. the maintenance of energy provision and energy security with the development 
of renewables), and help manage declining industries (Koasidis et al. 2020).

There  is  usually  a  social  dimension  to  such  transitions.  Key  elements  include  capacity  to  transform 
(Folke  et  al.  2010),  planning,  and  interdisciplinarity  (Woiwode  2013).  The  Second  World  War 
demonstrated  the  extent  to  which  crises  can  motivate  (sometimes  positive)  change  across  complex 
social and technical systems, including industry, and agriculture which then doubled its productivity 
over 15 years (Roberts and Geels 2019b). In practice, climate change may involve a combination of 
(reactive) transformational adaptation, and (proactive) societal transformation (Feola 2015), the latter 
seen as reorientation (including values and norms) in a sustainable direction (Section 5.4 in Chapter 5), 
including eg. ‘democratisation’ in energy systems (Sorman et al. 2020). Business change management 
principles could be relevant to support positive social change (Stephan et al. 2016). Overall, effective 
transitions rest on appropriate enabling conditions, which can also link socio-technical transitions to 
broader development pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16). 

Transition  theories  tend  to  come  from  very  different  disciplines  and  approaches  compared  to  either 
economics or other social sciences, with less quantification, notwithstanding evolutionary and complex 
system  models  (1.7.1.3).  However,  a  few  distinct  types  of  quantitative  models  of    ‘socio-technical 
energy transition’ (Li et al. 2015) have emerged. For policy evaluation, transitions can be viewed as 
processes in which dynamic efficiency (1.7.2) dominates over static allocative efficiency, with potential 
‘positive intervention points’ (Farmer et al. 2019). Given inherent uncertainties, there are obvious risks 
(e.g. Alic and Sarewitz 2016). All this may make an evaluation framework of risks and opportunities 
more  appropriate  than  traditional  cost-benefit  (Mercure  et  al.  2021),  and  (drawing  on  lessons  from 
renewables  and  electric  vehicles),  create  foundations  for  sector-based  international  ‘positive  sum 
cooperation’ in climate mitigation (Sharpe and Lenton 2021). 

1.7.4  Approaches from psychology and politics of changing course  

The continued increase in global emissions to 2019, despite three decades of scientific warnings of ever-
greater clarity and urgency, motivates growing attention in the literature to the psychological ‘faults of 
our rationality’ (Bryck and Ellis 2016), and the political nature of climate mitigation. 

1.7.4.1  Psychological and behavioural dimensions 

AR5  emphasised  that  decision  processes  often  include  both  deliberate  (‘calculate  the  costs  and 
beneﬁts’)  and  intuitive  thinking,  the  latter  utilising  emotion-  and  rule-based  responses  that  are 
conditioned by personal past experience, social context, and cultural factors (e.g. Kahneman 2003), and 
that laypersons tend to judge risks differently than experts -  for example, ‘intuitive’ reactions are often 
characterised by biases to status quo and aversion to perceived risks and ambiguity  (Kahneman and 
Tversky 1979). Many of these features of human reasoning create ‘psychological distance’ from climate 
change (Spence et al. 2012; Marshall 2014). These can impede adequate personal responses, in addition 
to  the  collective  nature  of  the  problem,  where  such  problems  can  take  the  form  of  ‘uncomfortable 
knowledge’, neglected and so becoming ‘Unknown knowns’ (Sarewitz 2020).These decision processes, 
and  the  perceptions  that  shape  them,  have  been  studied  through  different  lenses  from  psychology 
(Weber 2016) to sociology (Guilbeault et al. 2018), and media studies (Boykoff 2011). Karlsson and 
Gilek (2020) identify science denialism and ‘decision thresholds’ as key mechanisms of delay.  

Experimental  economics  (Allcott  2011)  also  helps  explain  why  cost-effective  energy  efficiency 
measures or other mitigation technologies are not taken up as fast or as widely as the benefits might 
suggest,  including  procrastination  and  inattention,  as  “we  often  resist  actions  with  clear  long-term 
benefits  if  they  are  unpleasant  in  the  short  run.”  (Allcott  and  Mullainathan  2010).  Incorporating 
behavioural and social dynamics in models is required particularly to better represent the demand side 
(Nikas et al. 2020), eg. Safarzyńska (2018) demonstrates how behavioural factors change responses to 
carbon  pricing  relative  to  other  instruments.  A  key  perspective  is  to  eschew  ‘either/or’  between

economic  and  behavioural  frameworks,  as  the  greatest  effects  often  involve  combining  behavioural 
dimensions (e.g. norms, social influence networks, convenience and quality assurance) with financial 
incentives and information (Stern et al. 2010).  Randomised, controlled field trials can help predict the 
effects  of  behavioural  interventions  (Levitt  and  List  2009;  McRae  and  Meeks  2016;  Gillan  2017). 
Chapter 5 explores both positive and negative dimensions of behaivour in more depth, including the 
development of norms and interactions with the wider social context, with emphasis upon the services  
associated with human wellbeing, rather than the economic activities per se.  

1.7.4.2  Socio-political and institutional approaches 

Political and institutional dynamics shape climate change responses in important ways, not least because 
incumbent  actors  have  frequently  blocked  climate  policy  (1.4.5).  Institutional  perspectives  probe 
networks of opposition (Brulle 2019) and emphasise that their ability to block  - as well as the ability 
of others to foster low carbon transitions - are structured by specific institutional forms across countries 
(Lamb  and  Minx  2020).  National  institutions  have  widely  been  developed  to  promote  traditionally 
fossil-fuel based sectors like electricity and transport as key to economic development, contributing to 
carbon lock-in (Seto et al. 2016) and inertia (Rosenschöld et al. 2014).  

The  influence  of  interest  groups  on  policy-making  varies  across  countries.  Comparative  political 
economy approaches tend to find that countries where interests are closely coordinated by governments 
(‘coordinated market economies’) have been able to generate transformative change more than those 
with  a  more  arms-length,  even  combative  relationship  between  interest  groups  and  governments 
(‘liberal market economies’) (Lachapelle and Paterson 2013; Meckling 2018; Ćetković and Buzogány 
2016; Zou et al. 2016). ‘Developmental states’ often have the capacity for strong intervention but any 
low-carbon  interventions  may  be  overwhelmed  by  other  pressures  and  very  rapid  economic  growth 
(Wood et al. 2020a).  

Institutional features affecting climate policy include levels and types of democracy (Povitkina 2018), 
electoral  systems,  or  levels  of  institutional  centralisation  (federal  vs  unitary  states,  presidential  vs 
parliamentary systems) (Steurer and Clar 2018; Clulow 2019; Lachapelle and Paterson 2013). Countries 
that  have  constructed  an  overarching  architecture  of  climate  governance  institutions  (e.g.  cross-
department  and  multilevel  coordination,  and  semi-autonomous  climate  agencies),  are  more  able  to 
develop strategic approaches to climate governance needed to foster transformative change  (Dubash 
2021).    

Access of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to policy processes enables new ideas to be adopted, 
but too close an NGO-government relation may stifle innovation and transformative action (Dryzek et 
al. 2003). NGO campaigns on fracking (Neville et al. 2019) or divestment (Mangat et al. 2018) have 
raised attention to ideas such as ‘stranded assets’ in policy arenas (Piggot 2018; Newell et al. 2020; 
Paterson  2021;  Green  2018).  Attempts  to  depoliticise  climate  change  may  narrow  the  space  for 
democratic participation and contestation, thus impacting policy responses (Swyngedouw 2010, 2011; 
Kenis and Lievens 2014). Some institutional innovations have more directly targeted enhanced public 
deliberation and participation, notably in citizens’ climate assemblies (Howarth et al. 2020) and in the 
use of legal institutions to litigate against those opposing climate action (Peel and Osofksy 2020). This 
literature  shows  that  transformative  pathways  are  possible  within  a  variety  of  institutional  settings, 
although institutional innovation will be necessary everywhere to pursue zero carbon transitions; see 
also Chapters 4 (Section 4) and 13. 

Balancing the forces outlined in Section 4.6 in Chapter 4 typically involves building coalitions of actors 
who benefit economically from climate policy (Levin et al. 2012). Policy stability is critical to enabling 
long-term  investments  in  decarbonisation  (Rietig  and  Laing  2017;  Rosenbloom  et  al.  2018).  Policy

design  can  encourage  coalitions  to  form,  that  sustain  momentum  by  supporting  further  policy 
development  to  accelerate  decarbonisation  (Roberts  et  al.  2018),  for  example  by  generating 
concentrated benefits to coalition members (Millar et al. 2020; Bernstein and Hoffmann 2018; Meckling 
2019), as with renewable feed-in-tariffs (FiTs) in Germany (Michaelowa et al. 2018). Coalitions may 
also  be  sustained  by  overarching  framings,  especially  to  involve  actors  (e.g.  NGOs)  for  whom  the 
benefits  of  climate  policy  are  not  narrowly  economic.  However  policy  design  can  also  provoke 
coalitions to oppose climate policy, as in the FiT programme in Ontario (Stokes 2013; Raymond 2020) 
or  the  yellow  vest  protests  against  carbon  taxation  in  France  (Berry  and  Laurent  2019).  The  ‘just 
transitions’ frame can thus also be understood in terms of coalition-building, as well as ethics, as  the 
pursuit of low carbon transitions which spread the economic benefits broadly, through ‘green jobs’, and 
the  redistributive  policies  embedded  in  them  both  nationally  and  globally  (Healy  and  Barry  2017; 
Winkler 2020). Appropriate policy design will be different at different stages of the transition process 
(Meckling et al. 2017; Breetz et al. 2018). 

Integration. Politics is ultimately the way in which societies make decisions  – which in turn, reflect 
diverse  forces  and  assumed  frameworks.  Effective  policy  requires  understandings  which  combine 
economic efficiency, ethics and equity, the dynamics and processes of large-scale transitions, and the 
role of psychology and politics.  No one framework is adequate to such a broad-ranging goal, nor are 
single tools. Chapter 13 (Figure 13.6) presents a ‘framing’ table for policy instruments depending on 
the extent to which they focus on mitigation per se or wider socio-economic development, and whether 
they  aim  to  shift  marginal  incentives  or  drive  larger  transitions.  Holistic  analysis  needs  to  bridge 
modelling, qualitative transition theories illuminated by case studies, and practice-based action research 
(Geels et al. 2016).  

These  analytic  frameworks  also  point  to  arenas  of  potential  synergies  and  trade-offs  (when  broadly 
known), and opportunities and risks (when uncertainties are greater), associated with mitigation. This 
offers  theoretical  foundations  for  mitigation  strategies  which  can  also  generate  co-benefits.  Climate 
policy may help to motivate policies with beneficial synergies (such as the consumer cost savings from 
energy efficiency, better forest management, transitions to cleaner vehicles) and opportunities (such as 
stimulating innovation), by focusing on options for which the positives outweigh the negatives, or can 
be made to through smart policy (e.g. Karlsson et al. 2020). More broadly, climate concerns may help 
to  attract  international  investment,  and  help  overcoming  bureaucratic  or  political  obstacles  to  better 
policy, to support synergies between mitigation, adaptation, and other SDGs, a foundation for shifting 
development pathways towards sustainability (Section 1.6.1; Chapter 17)

1.8   Feasibility and multi-dimensional assessment of mitigation 

1.8.1  Building on the SR1.5 assessment framework: feasibility and enabling conditions 

While previous ARs dealt with the definition of alternative mitigation pathways mostly exploring the 
technological potentials, latest research focused on what kind of mitigation pathways are feasible in a 
broader  sense,  underlining  the  multi-dimensional  nature  of  the  mitigation  challenge.  Building  on 
frameworks introduced by Majone (1975) and Gilabert and Lawford-Smith (2012), SR1.5 introduced 
multi-dimensional approaches to analysing ‘feasibility’ and ‘enabling conditions’, which AR6 develops 
and applies broadly in relation to six ‘dimensions of feasibility assessment’ (Figure 1.7). Two reflect 
the physical environment:  

•  Geophysical, not only the global risks from climate change but also, for technology assessment, the 

global availability of critical resources; 

•  Environmental & ecological, including local environmental constraints and co-benefits of different 

technologies and pathways  

The other four dimensions correspond broadly to the four Analytic Frameworks outlined in Section 1.7:  

•  Economic, particularly aggregate economic and financial indicators, and SDGs reflecting different 

stages and goals of economic development;  

•  Socio-cultural, including particularly ethical and justice dimensions, and social and cultural norms; 

•  Technological,  including  innovation  needs  and  transitional  dynamics  associated  with  new  and 

emergent technologies and associated systems; and  

• 

Institutional & political, including political acceptability, legal and administrative feasibility, and 
the capacity and governance requirements at different levels to deliver sustained mitigation in the 
wider context of sustainable development.

AR6  emphasises  that  all  pathways  involve  different  challenges  and  require  choices  to  be  made. 
Continuing  ‘business  as  usual’  is  still  a  choice,  which  in  addition  to  the  obvious  geophysical  risks, 
involves not making best use of new technologies, risks of future stranded assets, greater local pollution, 
and multiple other environmental threats.  

The  dimensions  as  listed  provide  a  basis  for  this  assessment  both  in  the  sectoral  chapters  (6-11), 
providing a common framework for cross-sectoral assessment detailed further in chapter 12,  and in the 
evaluation of global pathways (Section 3.2 in Chapter 3). More specific indicators under each of these 
dimensions  offer  consistency  in  assessing  the  challenges,  choices,  and enabling requirements  facing 
different aspects of mitigating climate change.

Figure 1.7: Feasibility and related dimensions of assessment 

 

 

Figure  1.7  also  illustrates  variants  on  these  dimensions  appropriate  for  evaluating  domestic  and 
international  policies  (Chapters  13  and  14).  The  SR1.5  (Section  4.4 in  Chapter 4)  also introduced a 
framework of ‘Enabling Conditions for systemic change’, which as illustrated also has key dimensions 
in  common  with  those  of  our  feasibility  assessment.  In  AR6  these  enabling  conditions  are  applied 
particularly in the context of shifting developments pathways (Chapter 4.4).  

Some fundamental criteria may span across several dimensions. Most obviously, issues of ethics and 
equity  are  intrinsic  to  the  economic,  socio-cultural  (values,  including  intergenerational  justice)  and 
institutional (e.g., procedural justice) dimensions. Geopolitical issues could also clearly involve several 
dimensions,  e.g.,  concerning  the  politics  of  international  trade,  finance  and  resource  distribution 
(economic  dimension);  international  vs  nationalistic  identity  (socio-cultural);  and  multilateral 
governance (institutional).  

In this report, chapters with a strong demand-side dimension also suggest a simple policy hierarchy, 
reflecting that avoiding wastage – demands superfluous to human needs and wants – can carry benefits 
across multiple indicators. Consequently, chapters 5 and 10 organise key actions in a hierarchy of Avoid

lock-in,  policies  and  ‘just 

transition’  

The  rest  of  this  section  illustrates  briefly  how  such  multi-dimensional  assessment,  utilising  the 
associated analytic frameworks, can shed light on a few key issues which arise across many chapters of 
this assessment. 

‘Carbon Lock-in’. The continued rise of global emissions reflects in part the strongly path-dependent 
nature of socio-economic systems, which implies a historic tendency to ‘carbon lock-in’ (Unruh 2000).  
An interdisciplinary review (Seto et al. 2016) identifies a dozen main components organised into four 
types, across the relevant Dimensions of Assessment as summarised in Table 1.3. 

 

Table 1.3: Carbon lock-in – types and key characteristics 

Source: Adapted from (Seto et al. 2016) 

Key characteristics 

- Large investments with long lead-times and sunk costs, made on basis of anticipated use of 
resources, capital, and equipment to pay back the investment and generate profits  
- Initial choices account for private but not social costs and benefits 
 
- Lock-in through social structure (e.g., norms and social processes) 
- Lock-in through individual decision making (e.g., psychological processes) 
- Single, calculated choices become a long string of non-calculated and self-reinforcing habits 
 which are- Interrupting habits is difficult but possible (e.g., family size, thermostat setting) to 
change  
- Individuals and communities become dependent on fossil-fuel economy, meaning that change 
may have adverse distributional impacts 
 
-  Learning-by-doing  and  scale  effects,  including  cumulative  nature  of  innovation,  reinforces 
established technologies 
- Interaction of technologies and networks (physical, organisational, financial) on which they 
depend  
- Random, unintentional events including network and learning effect final outcomes (e.g., 
Lock-in to the QWERTY keyboard) 
 
- Powerful economic, social, and political actors seek to reinforce status quo that favours their 
interests 
- Laws and Institutions, including regulatory structures, are designed to stabilise and lock -in 
also to provide long-term predictability (socio-technical regimes in transition theories) 
- Beneficial and intended outcomes for some actors 
- Not random chance but intentional choice (e.g., support for renewable electricity in 
Germany) can develop political consistencies that reinforce a direction of travel

Along with the long lifetime of various physical assets detailed in AR5, AR6 underlines the exceptional 
degree of path-dependence in urban systems (Chapter 8) and associated buildings (9) and transport (10) 
sectors,  but  it  is  a  feature  across  almost  all  the  major  emitting  sectors.    The  (typically  -expected) 
operating lifetimes of existing carbon-emitting assets would involve anticipated emissions (often but 
inaccurately  called  ‘committed’  emissions  in  the  literature),  substantially  exceeding  the  remaining

carbon  budgets  associated  with  1.5C  pathways  (Chapter  2.7).  Ongoing  GHG-intensive  investments, 
including those from basic industrialisation in poorer countries, are adding to this.  

The fact that investors anticipate a level of fossil fuel use that is  not compatible with severe climate 
constraints creates a clear risk of ‘stranded assets’ facing these investors (Box 6.2), and others who 
depend on them, which itself raises issues of equity. A multi-dimensional / multi-framework assessment 
helps to explain why such investments have continued, even in rich countries, and the consequent risks, 
and the complexity of shifting such investments in all countries. It may also inform approaches that 
could exploit path-dependence in clean energy systems, if there is sufficient investment in building up 
the low-GHG industries, infrastructures and networks required. 

Carbon  pricing.    Appraisal  of  policy  instruments  also  requires  such  multi-dimensional  assessment. 
Stern’s (2007) reference to climate change as “the greatest market failure in history” highlights that 
damages  inflicted  by  climate  change  are  not  properly  costed  in  most  economic  decision-making. 
Economic perspectives emphasise the value of removing fossil-fuel subsidies, and pricing emissions to 
‘internalise’ in economic decision-making the ‘external’ damages imposed by GHG emissions, and/or 
to meet agreed goals. Aggregate economic frameworks generally indicate carbon pricing  (on principles 
which  extend  to  other  gases)  as  the  most  cost-effective  way  to  reduce  emissions,  notwithstanding 
various market failures which complicate this logic.9  The High Level Commission on carbon pricing 
(Stern  and  Stiglitz  2017) estimated  an  appropriate  range  as  USD40-80/tCO2  in 2020,  rising  steadily 
thereafter. In practice the extent and level of carbon pricing implemented to date is far lower than this 
or than most economic analyses now recommend (Section 3.6.1 in Chapter 3), and nowhere is carbon 
pricing the only instrument deployed.  

A socio-cultural and equity perspective emphasises that the faith in and role of markets varies widely 
between countries – many energy systems do no in fact operate on a basis of competitive markets – and 
that because market-based carbon pricing involves large revenues transfers, it must also contend with 
major distributional effects and political viability (Klenert et al. 2018; Prinn et al. 2017), both domestic 
(Chapter  13)  and  international  (Chapter14).  A  major  review  (Maestre-Andrés  et  al.  2019)  finds 
persistent  distributional  concerns  (rich  incumbents  have  also  been  vocal  in  using  arguments  about 
impacts  on  the  poor  (Rennkamp  2019),  but  suggests  these  may  be  addressed  by  combining 
redistribution  of  revenues  with  support  for  low  carbon  innovation.  Measures  could  include 
redistributing the tax revenue to favour of low-income groups or differentiated carbon taxes (Metcalf 
2009; Klenert and Mattauch 2016; Stiglitz 2019), including ‘dual track’ approaches (van den Bergh et 
al. 2020). To an extent though, all these depend on levels of trust, and institutional capacity.  

Technological and transitions perspectives in turn find carbon pricing incentives may only stimulate 
incremental  improvements,  but  other  instruments  may  be  much  more  effective  for  driving  deeper 
innovation  and  transitions  (Chapters  14,  15,  16),  whilst  psychological  and  behavioural  studies 
emphasise many factors beyond only pricing (Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 in Chapter 5). In practice, a wide 
range of policy instruments are used (Chapter 13).  

Finally, in economic theory, negotiations on a common carbon price (or other common policies) may 
have large benefits (less subject to ‘free riding’) compared to a focus on negotiating national targets 
(Cramton et al. 2017a). The fact that this has never even been seriously considered (outside some efforts 
in the EU) may reflect the exceptional sovereignty sensitivities around taxation and cultural differences 
around the role of markets. However, carbon pricing concepts can be important outside of the traditional

risk/capital markets; network effects creating coordination failures; wider information failures; and co-benefits.

market (‘tax or trading’) applications. A ’social cost of carbon’ can be used to evaluate government and 
regulatory decisions, to compensate for inadequate carbon prices in actual markets, and by companies 
to reflect the external damage of their emissions and strategic risks of future carbon controls (Zhou and 
Wen 2020).  An agreed ‘social value of mitigation activities’ could form a basic index for underwriting 
risks in low carbon investments internationally (Hourcade et al. 2021a). 

Thus, practical assessment of carbon pricing inherently needs multi-dimensional analysis. The realities 
of political economy and lobbying have to date severely limited the implementation of carbon pricing 
(Mildenberger 2020), leading some social scientists to ask ‘Can we price carbon?’ (Rabe 2018).  Slowly 
growing adoption (World Bank 2019) suggests “yes”, but only through complex evolution of efforts: a 
study  of  66  implemented  carbon  pricing  policies  show  important  effects  of  regional  clustering, 
international processes, and seizing political windows of opportunity (Skovgaard et al. 2019).  

Just Transitions.  Finally, whilst ‘transition’ frameworks may explain potential dynamics that could 
transform systems, a multi-dimensional/multi-framework assessment underlines the motivation for ‘just 
transitions’ (see subsection 1.6.2.3 in this chapter and section 4.5 in Chapter 4). This can be defined as 
a transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy which is considered sufficiently equitable for 
the affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Jasanoff 2018; Newell 
and Mulvaney 2013). As noted, sufficient equity is not only an ethical issue but an enabler of deeper 
ambition  for  accelerated  mitigation  (Hoegh-Guldberg  et  al.  2019;  Klinsky  and  Winkler  2018; 
Urpelainen and Van de Graaf 2018). Perception of fairness influences the effectiveness of cooperative 
action (Winkler et al. 2018), and this can apply to affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors, 
regions and countries (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Jasanoff 2018).   

A ‘just transitions’ framing can also enable coalitions which integrate low carbon transformations with 
concerns for climate adaptation (Patterson et al. 2018). All this explains the emergence of ‘just transition 
Commissions’ in several of the more ambitious developed countries and complex social packages for 
coal phase-out in Europe (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4; Sovacool et al. 2019; Green and Gambhir 2020), as 
well  as  reference  to  the  concept  in  the  PA  and  its  emphasis  in  the  Talanoa  dialogue  and  Silesia 
declaration (1.2.2).  

Whilst the broad concepts of ‘just transition’ have roots going back decades, its specific realisation in 
relation to climate change is of course complex: Section 5 in Chapter 4 identifies at least eight distinct 
elements proposed in the literature, even before considering the international dimensions.  

 

1.9  Governing climate change  

Previous  sections  have  highlighted  the  multiple  factors  that  drive  and  constrain  climate  action,  the 
complex interconnection between climate mitigation and other societal objectives, and the diversity of 
analytical  frames  for  interpreting  these  connections.  Despite  the  complexities,  there  are  signs  of 
progress including increased societal awareness, change in social attitudes, policy commitments by a 
broad range of actors and sustained emission reductions in some jurisdictions. Nevertheless, emission 
trends  at  the  global  level  remains  incompatible  with  the  goals  agreed  in  the  Paris  Agreement. 
Fundamentally, the challenge of how best to urgently scale up and speed-up the climate mitigation effort 
at  all  scales  –from  local  to  global  –  to  the  pace  needed  to  address  the  climate  challenge  is  that  of 
governance understood as ‘modes and mechanisms to steer society’ (Jordan et al. 2015). The concept 
of governance encompasses the ability to plan and create the organisations needed to achieve a desired 
goal  (Güney  2017)  and  the  process  of  interaction  among  actors  involved  in  a  common  problem  for 
making and implementing decisions (Hufty 2012; Kooiman 2003).

Climate change governance has been projected as conscious transformation at unprecedented scale and 
speed  involving  a  contest  of  ideas  and  experimentation  across  scales  of  authority  and  jurisdiction 
(Hildén et al. 2017; Laakso et al. 2017; Gordon 2018; van der Heijden 2018; Kivimaa et al. 2017). Yet, 
there  remains  a  sense  that  achieving  the  urgent  transition  to  a  low  carbon,  climate  resilient  and 
sustainable  world  requires  significant  innovation  in  governance  (Hoffmann  2011;  Stevenson  and 
Dryzek 2013; Aykut 2016). 

Starting from an initial focus on multilateral agreements, climate change governance has long evolved 
into a complex polycentric structure that spans from the global to national and sub-national levels, with 
“multiple parallel initiatives involving a range of actors at different levels of governance” (Okereke et 
al. 2009) and relying on both formal and informal networks and policy channels channels (Bulkeley et 
al. 2014; Jordan et al. 2015). At the international level, implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 
UNFCCC  more  broadly  is  proceeding  in  parallel  with  other  activities  in  an  increasingly  diverse 
landscape  of  loosely  coordinated  institutions,  constituting  ’regime  complex’  (Keohane  and  Victor 
2011), and new cooperative efforts demonstrate an evolution in the shifting authority given to actors at 
different level of governance (Chan et al. 2018).  

Multi-level governance has been used to highlight the notion that the processes involved in making and 
implementing decisions on climate change is no longer the exclusive preserve of government actors but 
rather  involve  a  range  of  non-nation  state  actors  such  as  cities,  businesses,  and  civil  society 
organisations (Bäckstrand et al. 2017; Jordan et al. 2018; IPCC 2014a Chapter 13, 13.3.1 and 13.5.2). 
Increased multi-level participation of subnational actors, along with a diversity of other transnational 
and  non-state  actors  have  helped  to  facilitate  increased  awareness,  experimentation,  innovation, 
learning and achieving benefits at multiple scales. Multi-level participation in governance systems can 
help  to  build  coalitions  to  support  climate  change  mitigation  policies  (Roberts  et  al.  2018)  and 
fragmentation has the potential to take cooperative and even synergistic forms (Biermann et al. 2009)  

However, there is no guarantee that multilevel governance can successfully deal with complex human-
ecological  systems  (Biermann  et  al.  2017;  York  et  al.  2005;  Di  Gregorio  et  al.  2019).  Multi-level 
governance  can  contribute  to  an  extremely  polarised  discussion  and  policy  blockage  rather  than 
enabling policy innovation (Fisher and Leifeld 2019). Fragmented governance landscape may lead to 
coordination  and  legitimacy  gaps  undermining  the  regime  (Nasiritousi  and  Bäckstrand  2019). 
Nevertheless, the realities of the ‘drivers and constraints’ detailed in Section 4 the “glocal” nature of 
climate change, the divided authority in world politics, diverse preferences of public and private entities 
across  the  spectrum,  and  pervasive  suspicions  of  free  riding,  implying  the  challenge  as  how  to 
incrementally deepen cooperation in a polycentric global system, rather than seeking a single, integrated 
governance (Keohane and Victor 2016).  

Crucially,  climate  governance  takes  place  in  the  context  of  embedded  power  relations,  operating  at 
global, national and local context. Effective rules and institutions to govern climate change are more 
likely to emerge when where power structures and interests favour action. However widespread and 
enduring co-operation can only be expected to when the benefits outweigh the cost of cooperation and 
when the interest of key actors are sufficiently aligned (Barrett 1994; Victor 2011; Finus and Rübbelke 
2008; Tulkens 2019; Mainali et al. 2018). Investigating the distribution and role of hard and soft power 
resources, capacities and power relations within and across different jurisdictional levels is therefore 
important  to  uncover  hindrances  to  effective  climate  governance  (Marquardt  2017).    Institutions  at 
international and national levels as also critical as they have the ability to mediate power and interest of 
actors and sustain cooperation based on equity and fair rules and outcomes. Governance, in fact, helps 
to  align  and  moderate  the  interests  of  actors  as  well  as  to  shift  perceptions,  including  the  negative, 
burden-sharing  narratives  that  often  accompany  discussion  about  climate  action  especially  in

international negotiations. It is also useful for engaging the wider public and international networks in 
imagining  low  carbon  societies  (e.g.  Levy  and  Spicer  2013;  Milkoreit  2017;  Nikoleris  et  al.  2017; 
Wapner and Elver 2017; Bengtsson Sonesson et al. 2019; Fatemi et al. 2020). Experimentation also 
represents  an  important  source  of  governance  innovation  and  capability-formation,  linked  to  global 
knowledge  and  technology  flows,  which  could  reshape  emergent  socio-technical  regimes  and  so 
contribute to alternative development pathways (Berkhout et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2018; Turnheim et 
al. 2018; Lo and Castán Broto 2019). 

  

1.10 Conclusions 

Global  conditions  have  changed  substantially  since  the  IPCCs  Fifth  Assessment  in  2014.  The  Paris 
Agreement  and  the  SDGs  provided  a  new  international  context,  but  global  intergovernmental 
cooperation has been under intense stress. Growing direct impacts of climate change are unambiguous 
and movements of protest and activism – in countries and transnational organisations at many levels – 
have  grown.   Global emissions growth  had  slowed  but  not  stopped  up  to  2018/19,  albeit  with  more 
diverse  national  trends.  Growing  numbers  of  countries  have  adopted  ‘net  zero’  CO2  and/or  GHG 
emission  goals  and  decarbonisation  or  low  carbon  growth  strategies,  but  the  current  NDCs  to  2030 
collectively  would  barely  reduce  global  emissions  below  present  levels  (1.3.3)..  An  unfolding 
technology revolution is making significant contributions in some countries, but as yet its global impact 
is limited. Global climate change can only be tackled within, and if integrated with, the wider context 
of  sustainable  development,  and  related  social  goals  including  equity  concerns.  Countries  and  their 
populations have many conflicting priorities. Developing countries in particular have multiple urgent 
needs associated with earlier stages of sustainable development as reflected in the non-climate SDGs.  
Developed countries are amongst the most unsustainable in terms of overall consumption, but also face 
social constraints particularly arising from distributional impacts of climate policies.   

The  assessment  of  the  key  drivers  for,  and  barriers  against  mitigation  undertaken  in  this  chapter 
underscore the complexity and multidimensional nature of climate mitigation. Historically, much of the 
academic  analysis  of  mitigating  climate  change,  particularly  global  approaches,  has  focused  on 
modelling costs and pathways, and discussion about ‘optimal’ policy instruments. Developments since 
AR5 have continued to highlight the role of a wide range of factors intersecting the political, economic, 
social and institutional domains. Yet despite such complexities, there are signs of progress emerging 
from  years  of  policy  effort  in  terms  of  technology,  social  attitudes,  emission  reductions  in  some 
countries, with tentative signs of impact on the trajectory of global emissions.  The challenge remains 
how best to urgently scale up and speed-up the climate mitigation effort at all scales  –from local to 
global – to achieve the level of mitigation needed to address the problem as indicated by climate science. 
A  related  challenge  is  how  to  ensure that mitigation  effort  and  any  associated  benefits  of  action  are 
distributed  fairly  within  and  between  countries  and  aligned  to  the  overarching  objective  of  global 
sustainable development. Lastly, globally effective and efficient mitigation will require international 
co-operation especially in the realms of finance, and technology.  

Multiple frameworks of analytic assessment, adapted to the realities of climate change mitigation, are 
therefore  required.  We  identified  four  main  groups.  Aggregate  economic  frameworks  –  including 
environmental costs or goals, and with due attention to implied behavioural, distributional and dynamic 
assumptions  -  can  provide  insights  about  trade-offs,  cost-effectiveness  and  policies  for  delivering 
agreed  goals.  Ethical  frameworks  are  equally  essential  to  inform  both  international  and  domestic 
discourse  and  decisions,  including  the  relationship  with  international  (and  intergenerational) 
responsibilities,  related  financial  systems,  and  domestic  policy  design  in  all  countries.  Explicit

frameworks for analysing transition and transformation across multiple sectors need to draw on both 
socio-technical  transition  literatures,  and  those  on  social  transformation.    Finally,  literatures  on 
psychology, behaviour and political sciences can illuminate obstacles that have impeded progress to 
date, and suggest ways to overcome them.  

No single analytical framework, or single discipline, on its own can offer a comprehensive assessment 
of climate change mitigation. Together they point to the relevance of growing literatures and discourses 
on ‘just transitions’, and the role of governance at multiple levels.  Ultimately all these frameworks are 
needed to inform the decisions required to deepen and connect the scattered elements of progress to 
date, and hence accelerate progress towards agreed goals and multiple dimensions of climate  change 
mitigation in the context of sustainable development.  

 

1.11 Knowledge gaps  

Despite huge expansion in the literature (Callaghan et al. 2020), knowledge gaps remain. Modeling still 
struggles to bring together detailed physical and economic climate impacts and mitigation, with limited 
representation  of  financial  and  distributional  dynamics.  There  are  few  interdisciplinary  tools  which 
apply  theories  of  transition  and  transformation  to  questions  of  economic  and  social  impacts, 
compounded  by  remaining  uncertainties concerning  the  role  of  new technological sets, international 
instruments, policy and political evaluation. 

One scan of future research needs suggests three priority areas (Roberts et al. 2020); 1. Human welfare 
focused  development  (e.g.  reducing  inequality),  2.  How  the  historic  position  of  states  within 
international  power  relations  conditions  their  ability  to  respond  to  climate  change,  3.  Transition 
dynamics and the flexibility of institutions to drive towards low carbon development pathways. There 
remain  gaps  in  understanding  how  international  dynamics  and  agreements  filter  down  to  affect 
constituencies  and  local  implementation.  Literature  on  the  potential  for  supply  side  agreements,  in 
which producers agree to restrict the supply of fossil fuels (e.g. Asheim et al. 2019) is limited but gaining 
increasing academic attention. 

Nature  is  under  pressure  both  at  land  and  at  sea  as  demonstrated  by  declining  biodiversity  (IPBES 
2019).  Climate  policies  could  increase  the  pressure  on  land  and  oceans  (see  IPCC  2019c,b),  with 
insufficient  attention  to  relationships  between  biodiversity  and  climate  agreements  and  associated 
policies.  IPBES  aims  to  coordinate  with  the  IPCC  more  directly,  but  literature  will  be  required  to 
support these reports.  

Compounding these gaps is the fact that socially oriented, agriculture-related options, where human and 
non-human systems intersect most obviously, remain under-researched (e.g. Balasubramanya and Stifel 
2020). Efforts to engage with policies here, especially framed around ecosystem services, have often 
neglected their “practical fitness” in favor of focusing on their “institutional fitness”, which needs to be 
addressed in future research (Stevenson et al. 2021). 

The relative roles of short-term mitigation policies and long-term investments, including government 
and financial decision-making tools, remains inadequately explored. Strategic investments may include 
city planning, public transport, EV charging networks, and CCU/CCS. Understanding how international 
treaties  can  increase  incentives  to  make  such  investments  is  all  the more  salient  in  the  aftermath  of 
COVID-19,  on  which  research  is  necessarily  young  but  rapidly  growing.  Finally,  the  economic, 
institutional  and  political  strategies  to  close  the  gap  between  NDCs,  actual  implementation,  and 
mitigation  goals–  informed  by  the  PA  and  the  UNFCCC  Global  Stocktake  –  require  much  further 
research.

(5), a new chapter for IPCC Assessments, focuses upon the role of services and derived demand for 
energy and land use, and the social dimensions.  

Chapters  6-12  examine  sectoral  contributions  and  possibilities  for  mitigation.  (6)  summarises 
characteristics and trends in the energy sector, specifically supply, including the remarkable changes in 
the cost of some key technologies since AR5; (7) examines the roles of AFOLU, drawing upon and 
updating the recent Special Report, including the potential tensions between the multiple uses of land; 
(8) presents a holistic view of the trends and pressures of urban systems, as both a challenge and an 
opportunity for mitigation; Chapters 9 and 10 then examine two sectors which entwine with, but go 
well beyond, urban systems: buildings (9) including construction materials and zero carbon buildings; 
and transport (10), including shipping and aviation and a wider look at mobility as a general service; 
(11)  explores  the  contribution  of  industry,  including  supply  chain  developments,  resource 
efficiency/circular  economy,  and  the  cross-system  implications  of  decarbonisation  for  industrial 
systems;  finally  (12)  takes  a  cross-sectoral  perspective  and  explores  cross-cutting  issues  like  the 
interactions of biomass energy, food and land, and carbon dioxide removal.  

Four  chapters  then  review  thematic  issues  in  implementation  and  governance  of  mitigation.  (13) 
explores  national  and  sub-national  policies  and  institutions,  bringing  together  lessons  of  policies 
examined in the sectoral chapters, as well as insights from service and demand-side perspectives (5), 
along with governance approaches and capacity-building, and the role and relationships of sub-national 
actors.  (14) then  considers  the  roles  and  status  of  international  cooperation,  including  the  UNFCCC 
agreements  and  international  institutions,  sectoral  agreements  and  multiple  forms  of  international 
partnerships, and the ethics and governance challenges of Solar Radiation Modification. (15) explores 
investment and finance, including current trends, the investment needs for deep decarbonisation, and 
the  complementary  roles  of  public  and  private  finance.  This  includes  climate-related  investment 
opportunities and risks (e.g. ‘stranded assets’), linkages between finance and investments in adaptation 
and mitigation; and the impact of COVID-19.  A new chapter on innovation (16) looks at technology 
development,  accelerated  deployment  and  global  diffusion  as  systemic issues that  hold  potential for 
transformative changes, and the challenges of managing such changes at multiple levels including the 
role of international cooperation.  

Finally, (17) considers Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development, including 
practical pathways for joint responses to climate change and sustainable development challenges. This 
includes  major  regional  perspectives,  mitigation-adaptation  interlinkages,  and  enabling  conditions 
including the roles of technology, finance and cooperation for sustainable development.  

 

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

FAQ 1.1 What is climate change mitigation?  

Climate change mitigation refers to actions or activities that limit emissions of GHGs from entering the 
atmosphere  and/or  reduce  their  levels  in  the  atmosphere.  Mitigation  includes  reducing  the  GHGs 
emitted from energy production and use (eg. that reduces use of fossil fuels) and land use, and methods 
to mitigate warming eg. by carbon sinks which remove emissions from the atmosphere through land 
use or other (including artificial) mechanisms (See section 12.3, 14.4.5; see WGI for physical science, 
and Chapter 7 for AFOLU mitigation). 

The ultimate goal of mitigation is to preserve a biosphere which can sustain human civilisation and the 
complex  of  ecosystem  services  which  surround  and  support  it.  This  means  reducing  anthropogenic 
GHGs  emissions  towards  net  zero  to  limit  the  warming,  with  global  goals  agreed  in  the  Paris

Agreement.  Effective  mitigation  strategies  require  an  understanding  of  mechanisms  that  underpin 
release of emissions, and the technical, policy and societal options for influencing these 

FAQ 1.2 Which Greenhouse Gasses (GHGs) are relevant to which sectors? 

Anthropogenic  GHGs  such  as  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  methane  (CH4),  nitrous  oxide  (N2O),  and 
fluorinated gases (e.g. hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, Sulphur hexafluoride) are released from 
various sources. CO2 makes the largest contribution to global GHG emissions; but some have extremely 
long atmospheric lifetimes extending to tens of thousands of years, such as F gases (Chapter 2).  

Different  combinations  of  gases  are  emitted  from  different  activities.  The  largest  source  of  CO2  is 
combustion of fossil fuels in energy conversion systems like boilers in electric power plants, engines in 
aircraft and automobiles, and in cooking and heating within homes and businesses (approximately 64% 
of emissions, Figure SPM.2). Fossil fuels are also a major source of methane (CH4), the second biggest 
contributor to global warming. While most GHGs come from fossil fuel combustion, about one quarter 
comes  from  land-related  activities  like agriculture (mainly  CH4  and  N2O)  and  deforestation (mainly 
CO2),  with  additional  emissions  from  industrial  processes  (mainly  CO2,  N2O  and  F-gases),  and 
municipal waste and wastewater (mainly CH4) (2). In addition to these emissions, black carbon – an 
aerosol  that  is,  for  example,  emitted  during  incomplete  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  –  contributes  to 
warming  of  the  Earth’s  atmosphere,  whilst  some  other  short-lived  pollutants  temporarily  cool  the 
surface (IPCC WG1 Chapter 6.5.4.3).  

FAQ 1.3 What is the difference between “net zero emissions” and “carbon neutrality”?  

Annex I states that “carbon neutrality and net zero CO2 emissions are overlapping concepts” which 
“can be applied at the global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national)”. At the 
global scale the terms are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net-zero CO2 typically applies to emissions 
under direct control or territorial responsibility of the entity reporting them (e.g. a country, district or 
sector); while carbon neutrality is also applied to firms, commodities and activities (e.g. a service or an 
event) and generally includes emissions and removals beyond the entity’s direct control or territorial 
responsibility, termed ‘Scope 3’ or ‘value chain emissions’ (Bhatia et al. 2011).  

This means the emissions and removals that should be included are wider for ‘neutrality’ than for net-
zero  goals,  but  also  that  offset  mechanisms  could  be  employed  to  help  achieve  neutrality  through 
abatement  beyond  what  is  possible  under  the  direct  control  of  the  entity.  Rules  and  environmental 
integrity criteria are intended to ensure additionality and avoid double counting of offsets consistent 
with “neutrality” claims (see Annex I definitions of “Carbon neutrality” and “Offset” for detail and a 
list of criteria).  

While the term ‘carbon’ neutrality in this report is defined as referring specifically to CO2 neutrality, 
use of this term in practice can be ambiguous, as some users apply it to neutrality of all GHG emissions. 
GHG neutrality means an entity’s gross emissions of all GHG must be balanced by the removal of an 
equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere. This requires the selection of a suitable metric that 
aggregates  emissions  from  non-CO2  gases,  such  as  the  commonly  used  GWP100  metric  (for  a 
discussion  of  GHG  metrics,  see  AR6  WG1  Box  1.3  and  Cross-Chapter  Box  2  in  Chapter  2  of  this 
report).
