In general, the term ‘implementation gap’ refers to the difference between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In this report, the term refers to the gap between mitigation pledges contained in national determined contributions, and the expected outcome of existing policies. There is considerable literature on country-level mitigation pathways, including but not limited to NDCs. Country distribution of this literature is very unequal (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>).

There is, furthermore, a potential difference between mitigation targets set in NDCs <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ex ante</span> and what is achieved <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ex post </span>. A limited number of studies assess the implementation gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity building support. The disruptionstriggered by the COVID-19 epidemic increase uncertainty over range of projections relative to pre-COVID-19 literature. As indicated by a growing number of studies at the national and global level, how large near- to mid-term emissions implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are, to a large degree depends on how stimulus or recovery packages are designed. <!-- -->{4.2, 4.2.2.5, Cross-Chapter Box 4}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Given the gaps, there is a need to explore accelerated mitigation (relative to NDCs and current policies). </span>There is increasing understanding of the technical content of accelerated mitigation pathways, differentiated by national circumstances, with considerable though uneven literature at country-level (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>).

A focus on energy use and supply is essential, but not sufficient on its own – the land sector and food systems deserve attention. The literature does not adequately include demand-side options and systems analysis, and captures the impact from non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>GHGs with medium confidence. Countries and regions will have different starting points for transition pathways. Some factors include climate conditions resulting in different heating and cooling needs, endowments with different energy resources, patterns of spatial development, and political and economic conditions. <!-- -->{4.2.5}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Accelerated mitigation alone may run into obstacles. </span>If such obstacles are rooted in underlying structural features of society, then transforming such structures helps remove obstacles, which amounts to shifting development pathways. Various actors have developed an increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050 (mid-term). A growing number of such strategies aim at net zero GHG or CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions, but it is not yet possible to draw global implications due to the limited size of sample (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">low agreement</span>). Non-state actors are also engaging in a wide range of mitigation initiatives. When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub-national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could reduce up to about 20 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span>-eq in 2030 (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">limited evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). Yet perceived or real conflicts between mitigation and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found to have significant implications for development objectives and macroeconomic costs at country level. For example, most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation(<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). The literature finds that employment effect of mitigation policies tends to be limited on aggregate, but can be significant at sectoral level (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">limited evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). Detailed design of mitigation policies is critical for distributional impacts and avoiding lock-in (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>), though further research is needed in that direction. <!-- -->{4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.6}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Shifting development pathways towards sustainability offers ways to (i) broaden the range of levers and enablers that a society can use to provide enabling conditions and accelerate mitigation; and (ii) increase the chances of advancing at the same time towards mitigation and towards other development goals. </span>The way countriesdevelop determines their capacity to accelerate mitigation and achieve other sustainable development objectives simultaneously (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium-robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). Yet meeting ambitious mitigation and development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change, hence the focus on shifting development pathways (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). Though development pathways result from the actions of a wide range of actors, it is possible to shift development pathways through policies and enhancing enabling conditions (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">limited evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). For example, policies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally conceived and implemented in the pursuit of overall societal development objectives, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. In some countries, such policies are framed as part of a just transition. However, they can have major influence on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options, as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway ‘Shifting Pathways’ (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). There are practical options to shift development pathways in ways that advance mitigation and other sustainable development objectives, supporting political feasibility, increase resources to meet multiple goals, and reduce emissions (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">limited evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). Concrete examples assessed in this chapter include high employment and low emissions structural change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social contract, combining housing policies to deliver both housing and transport mitigation, and change economic, social and spatial patterns of development of the agriculture sector provide the basis for sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation. These examples differ by context. Examples in other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole economies and societies. Coordinated policy mixes would need to coordinate multiple actors – individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors – to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support mitigation and adaptation. Some studies explore the risks of high complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways. <!-- -->{4.3, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.1.7–4.4.1.10, Figure 4.7, Cross-Chapter Box 5, 5.8, Box 6.2, 8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5, Cross-Chapter Box 7, Cross-Chapter Box 12}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The literature identifies a broad set of enabling conditions that can both foster shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation, along five categories</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">medium evidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">, <span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high agreement</span>).</span> Policy integration is a necessary component of shifting development pathways, addressing multiple objectives.

Improved institutions and governance enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation gaps (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). Given that strengthening institutions may be a long term endeavour, it needs attention in the near ter m.

Opportunities exist in the near term to close the finance gap. At the national level, public finance for actions promoting the SDG agenda helps broaden the scope of mitigation (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>).

In that regard, the just transition concept has become an international focal point tying together social movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon transitions.

Deepening mitigation means more rapid decarbonisation. Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability (SDPS) broadens the scope of mitigation. Putting the enabling conditions above in place supports both. Depending on context, some enabling conditions such as shifting behaviour may take time to establish, underscoring the importance of early action. Other enabling conditions, such as improved access to financing, can be put in place in a relatively short time frame, and can yield results rapidly.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Accelerating mitigation: </span>The literature points to well-understood policy measures and technologies for accelerating mitigation, though the balance depends on country specificities: (i) decarbonising electricity supply to produce net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, including renewable energy, (ii) radically more efficient use of energy than today; (iii) electrification of end-uses including transport; (iv) dramatically lower use of fossil fuels than today; (v) converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; (vi) promote bioenergy, demand reduction, dietary changes, and policies, incentives, and rules for mitigation in the land sector; and (vii) setting and meeting ambitious targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers.

Chapter 4, on the other hand, works forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) (Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2) and from current development paths to assess the implications for near- and mid-term greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, cities, communities and non-state actors are taking leadership in implementing more ambitious action (Section 4.2.3). This chapter also assesses national low emission development strategies (Section 4.2.4).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Where do we want to go?</span> Technical alternatives and policy options exist to bridge the emissions and implementation gaps, and the literature illustrates these with a wide range of accelerated techno-economic pathways that deepen decarbonisation closer to the pace and scale required (<a class="section-link" data-title="What Is to Be Done to Accelerate Mitigation?" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.5">Section 4.2.5</a>), and examines their impacts on other development objectives (<a class="section-link" data-title="Implications of Accelerated Mitigation for National Development Objectives" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.6">Section 4.2.6</a>). In practice, however, scaling up at the broader, deeper, and faster level required to meet climate goals while advancing other development objectives regularly faces prohibitive obstacles (<a class="section-link" data-title="Obstacles to Accelerated Mitigation and How Overcoming Them Amounts to Shifts in Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.7">Section 4.2.7</a>).

Deliberate measures taken to facilitate the shifting of development pathways and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling conditions that help overcome those obstacles (Figure 4.6) – improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change and technological innovation, designing and implementing adequate policy, and finance. Just transitions, while they will differ by context, are critical to identifying and avoiding or addressing inequitable distributive consequences (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">h</span><span class="•-Condensed-italic">igh agreement</span>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Enabling conditions necessary to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways are discussed in depth in Chapters 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16.

The national scale selected in this chapter requires attention as national mitigation pathways cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (Box 4.2).

In AR5, all mitigation pathways were assessed in a single chapter (Clarke et al. 2014), which focused mostly on the long term. IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) included a chapter on mitigation pathways compatible with the temperature goal in the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018a">Rogelj et al. 2018a</a>), mostly at the global level. It also considered strengthening mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al. 2018</a>) in the context of poverty, inequality and sustainable development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al. 2018</a>). Development pathways have also been explored, albeit less frequently, in past IPCC reports starting with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al. 2000).

First NDCs contain mitigation targets, and in many cases also provisions about adaptation.

Baseline years vary from 1990 to 2015 and in almost all NDCs the targeted time frame is 2030, with a few specified periods of until 2025, 2035, 2040 or 2050. Around 43% of the mitigation targets in first NDCs are expressed in terms of deviation below business-as-usual by a specified target year, either for the whole economy or for specific sectors, while around 35% include fixed-level targets (either reductions or limitations compared to base years), and another 22% refer to intensity targets (in terms of GHG, CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or energy) or policies and measures, with an increasing number of Parties moving to absolute emission reduction targets in their new or updated NDCs (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016a">UNFCCC 2016a</a>, 2021).

Given the uncertainty behind LULUCF emission and removal accounting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grassi--2017">Grassi et al. 2017</a>; Jian et al. 2019), several countries state that their accounting framework will only be defined in later NDCs. The GHG included and the global warming potentials (GWPs) used to aggregate emissions also vary across NDCs. Most countries only refer to carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions aggregated based on IPCC AR2 or AR4 metrics, while few NDCs also include <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases">fluorinated gases</a> and use IPCC AR5 GWPs.

Global models provide an overview, are necessary for assessment of global phenomena (e.g., temperature change), can integrate climate models and trade effects. National models typically include more details on sectors, technology, behaviour and intersectoral linkages, but often use simplifying assumptions for international trade (e.g., the Armington elasticity approach). Critically, they can also better reflect local socio-economic and political conditions and their evolution (i.e., national development pathways). A variety of modelling paradigms are found, including optimisation and simulation models, myopic and with foresight, monolithic and modular (Annex III: Scenarios and Modelling Methods).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Among the hybrid approaches, three broader categories can be distinguished, (i) direct use of official emission projection as part of submitted NDC or other communication to UNFCCC, (ii) historical trend extrapolation of emissions based on inventory data, possibly disaggregated by sector and emission species, and (iii) use of Reference/Business-As-Usual pathways from an independent published study (e.g., IEA WEO). In all cases, the reductions are then estimated on top of the resulting emission trajectory. Note that globally comprehensive studies may vary the approach used depending on the country.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a number of dimensions, including (i) their spatial resolution and coverage, (ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are included in the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate them, the emissions inventory (official vs independent inventory data) and related accounting approaches used as a starting point for the projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, etc.), and (v) the degree to which individual policies and their impact on emissions are explicitly represented (Table 4.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging from macro-scale regions with globally comprehensive coverage to national level (Section 4.2.2.3) and sub-national and company level in a few cases (Section 4.2.3). It is important to recognise that globally comprehensive studies typically resolve a limited number of countries individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, but have poor resolution of remaining countries or regions, which are assessed in aggregate terms. Conversely, studies with high resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the global scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts to provide a composite global picture from detailed national studies (Bataille et al. 2016a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Deep%20Decarbonization%20Pathways%20Project--2015">Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roelfsema--2020">Roelfsema et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A second dimension in which the studies are different is their comprehensiveness of covering different emitting sectors. Some studies focus on the contribution of a single sector, for example the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fyson--2019">Fyson and Jeffery 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grassi--2017">Grassi et al. 2017</a>) or the energy system (including both energy supply and demand sectors), to emission reductions as specified in the NDC. Such studies give an indication of the importance of a given sector to achieving the NDC target of a country and can be used as a benchmark to compare to comprehensive studies, but adding sectoral contributions up represents a methodological challenge.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Third, GHG coverage is different across studies. Some focus on CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> only, while others take into account the full suite of Kyoto gases (CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, CH<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>, N<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>O, HFCs, PFCs and SF<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>). For the latter, different metrics for aggregating GHGs to a CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-equivalent metric are being used, typically GWP 100 from different IPCC assessments (Table 4.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Fourth, studies typically cover a set of scenarios, though how these scenarios are defined varies widely. The literature reporting IAM results often includes <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Nationally Determined Contribution</span> (NDC), which are officially communicated, and <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Current Policies</span> (CP) as interpreted by modellers. Studies based on national modelling, by contrast, tend to define scenarios reflecting very different national contexts. In both cases, modellers typically include so-called <span class="•-Condensed-italic">No Policy Baseline</span> scenarios (alternatively referred to as <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Reference</span> or <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Business-as-Usual scenarios</span>) which do not necessarily reflect currently implemented policies and thus are not assessed as reference pathways (<a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.6.1">Section 4.2.6.1</a>). There are also various approaches to considering more ambitious action compared to the CP or NDC projections that are covered in addition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Fifth, studies differ in the way they represent policies (current or envisioned in NDCs), depending on their internal structure. For example, a subsidy to energy efficiency in buildings may be explicitly modelled (e.g., in a sectoral model that represents household decisions relative to building insulation), represented by a proxy (e.g., by an exogenous decrease in the discount rate households use to make choices), or captured by its estimated outcome (e.g., by an exogenous decrease in the household demand for energy, say in an energy system model or in a compact CGE). Detailed representations (such as the former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate results than compact ones (the latter example), but the set of assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be very different.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just implementing high level targets specified in policy documents and NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact on emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and policies at sub-national level. In addition, in countries with rapidly evolving policy environments, slightly different cut-off dates for the policies considered in an emission projection can make a significant difference for the results (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2018">Dubash et al. 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The challenges described above are dealt with in the assessment of quantitative results in Section 4.2.2.3 by (i) comparing national studies with country-level results from global studies to understand systematic biases; (ii) comparing economy-wide emissions (including AFOLU) as well as energy-related emissions; (iii) using different emission metrics including CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> and Kyoto GHG emissions where the latter have been harmonised to using AR6 GWP100 metrics; and (iv) tracking cut-off dates of implemented policies and NDCs used in different references (Table 4.SM.1). The most notable differences in quantitative emission estimates related to current policies and NDCs relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications and to the updated NDCs mostly submitted since early 2020 which are separately dealt with in Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.5, respectively.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In addition to assessing the emissions outcomes of NDCs, some studies report development indicators, by which they mean a wide diversity of socio-economic indicators (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jiang--2013">Jiang et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chai--2014">Chai and Xu 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Delgado--2014">Delgado et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#La%20Rovere--2014a">La Rovere et al. 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zevallos--2014">Zevallos et al. 2014</a>; Benavides et al. 2015; Altieri et al. 2016; Bataille et al. 2016a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zou--2016">Zou et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Paladugula--2018">Paladugula et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Parikh--2018">Parikh et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2021">Yang et al. 2021</a>), share of low-carbon energy (Bertram et al. 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Riahi--2015">Riahi et al. 2015</a>), renewable energy deployment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roelfsema--2018">Roelfsema et al. 2018</a>), production of fossil fuels (<a class="reference-link" href="#SEI--2020">SEI et al. 2020</a>) or investments into low-carbon mitigation measures (<a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2018">McCollum et al. 2018</a>) to track progress towards long-term temperature goals.</p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table 4.1 | Assessment of projected 2030 emissions of current policies based on pre-COVID assumptions and original NDCs submitted in 2015/16 for 28 individual countries/regions and the world. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>The table compares projected emissions from globally comprehensive studies, national studies and, when available, official communications to UNFCCC using different emission sources (fossil fuels, AFOLU sector) and different emission metrics (CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, Kyoto GHGs).

In Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1, we report estimates of the emissions reductions from 19 distinct sub-national and non-state initiatives to mitigate climate change. The table shows wide ranges of potential mitigation based on current, target or potential membership, as well as a wide diversity of actors and membership assumptions. Current membership reflects the number of non-state or sub-national actors that are presently committed to a particular initiative; while targeted or potential membership represents a membership goal (e.g., increasing from 100 to 200 members) that an initiative may seek to achieve (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kuramochi--2020">Kuramochi et al. 2020</a>). When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub-national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could reduce up to about 20 Gt of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq in 2030 (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">limited evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). <a class="section-link" data-title="Urban systems and other settlements" href="/chapters/chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> also presents data on the savings potential of cities and it suggests that these could reach 2.3 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span>-eq annually by 2030 and 4.2 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span>-eq annually for 2050.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Non-state action may be broader than assessed in the literature so far, though subject to uncertainty. The examples in Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1<span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> do not include initiatives that target the emissions from religious organisations, colleges and universities, civic and cultural groups, and, to some extent, households, and in this sense may underestimate sub-national potential for mitigating emissions, rather than overestimate it. That said, the estimates are contingent on assumptions that sub-national and non-state actors achieve commitments – both with respect to mitigation and in some cases membership – and that these actions are not accounted for in nor lead to weakening of national actions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Care is to be taken not to depict these efforts as additional to action within national NDCs, unless this is clearly established (<a class="reference-link" href="#Broekhoff--2015">Broekhoff et al. 2015</a>). There are potential overlaps between individual NSAs and ICIs, and across ICIs. <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuramochi--2020">Kuramochi et al. (2020)</a> propose partial and conservative partial effect methods to avoid double counting when comparing ambition, a matter that merits further attention. As the diversity of actions increased, the potential to count the same reductions multiple times increases.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Equally important to note here is that none of the studies reviewed in Figure 4.1 quantified the potential impact of financial sector actions, for example, divestment from emission intensive activities (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Current Financial Flows" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.3">Section 15.3</a> has a more detailed discussion of how financial actors and instruments are addressing climate change). Moreover, only a limited number of studies on the impact of actions by diverse actors go beyond 2050 (Table 4.4), which may reflect analysts’ recognition of the increasing uncertainties of longer time horizons. Accurate accounting methods can help to avoiding counting finance multiple times, and methods across mitigation and finance would consider counting carbon market flows and the tons reduced. As Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1 indicate, activities by businesses have potential to significantly contribute to global mitigation efforts. For example, the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) encourages companies to pledge to reduce their emissions at rates which according to SBTi would be compatible with global pathways to well below 2°C or 1.5°C, with various methodologies being proposed (Andersen et al. 2021; <a class="reference-link" href="#Faria--2019">Faria and Labutong 2019</a>). Readers may note, however, that the link between emissions by individual actors and long-term temperature goals cannot be inferred without additional assumptions (Box 4.2). In the energy sector, some voluntary initiatives are also emerging to stop methane emissions associated with oil and gas supply chains. The Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) is a voluntary initiative lead by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which has recently published a comprehensive framework for methane detection, measurement and reporting (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2020b">UNEP 2020b</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Initiatives made up of cities and sub-national regions have an especially large potential to reduce emissions, due to their inclusion of many actors, across a range of different geographic regions, with ambitious emissions reduction targets, and these actors’ coverage of a large share of emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kuramochi--2020">Kuramochi et al. 2020</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Hsu--2019">Hsu et al. (2019)</a> find largest potential in that area. Several sub-national regions like California and Scotland have set zero emission targets (<a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6hne--2019">Höhne et al. 2019</a>), supported by short- and medium-term interim goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scottish%20Government--2020b">Scottish Government 2020b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#State%20of%20California--2018">State of California 2018</a>). Sharing of effort across global and sub-global scales has not been quantified, though one study suggests that non-state actors have increasingly adopted more diverse framings, including vulnerability, human rights and transformational framings of justice (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shawoo--2020">Shawoo and McDermott 2020</a>). Initiatives focused on forestry have high emissions reduction potential due to the current high deforestation rates, and due to the ambitious targets of many of these forestry initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Forests’ goal to end deforestation by 2030 (<a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6hne--2019">Höhne et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lui--2021">Lui et al. 2021</a>), although the Initiative acknowledges that insufficient progress has to-date been made towards this goal (<a class="reference-link" href="#NYDF%20Assessment%20Partners--2020">NYDF Assessment Partners 2020</a>). On the other hand, uncertainties in global forest carbon emissions (and therefore potential reductions) are high and despite a multitude of initiatives in the sector, actually measured deforestation rates have not declined since the initiative was announced in 2014 (Sections 7.2 and 7.3.1). Moreover, not all initiatives are transparent about how they plan to reach their goals and may also rely on offsets.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Initiatives focused on non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions, and particularly on methane, can achieve sizable reductions, in the order of multiple GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span>-eq yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> (Table 4.4). The Global Cement and Concrete Association (formerly the Cement Sustainability Initiative), has contributed to the development of consistent energy and emissions reporting from member companies. The CSI also suggested possible approaches to balance GHG mitigation and the issues of competitiveness and leakage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cook--2011">Cook and Ponssard 2011</a>). The member companies of the GCCA (CSI) have become better prepared for future legislation on managing GHG emissions and developed management competence to respond to climate change compared to non-member companies in the cement sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Busch--2008">Busch et al. 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Global%20Cement%20and%20Concrete%20Association--2020">Global Cement and Concrete Association 2020</a>). Accordingly, the cement industry has developed some roadmaps to reach net zero GHG around 2050 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sanju%C3%A1n--2020">Sanjuán et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">It is also important to note that individual NSAs and ICIs that commit to GHG mitigation activities are often scarce in many crucial and ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors, such as iron and steel, cement and freight transport (Chapters 10 and 11). Sub-national and non-state action efforts could help these sectors meet an urgent need to accelerate the commercialisation and uptake of technical options to achieve low zero emissions (Bataille 2020).</p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table 4.4 | Emissions

Table 4.6 lists the countries that have a national net zero by 2050 target in laws, strategies or other documents (<a class="reference-link" href="#The%20Energy%20and%20Climate%20Intelligence%20Unit--2019">The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit 2019</a>). Bhutan and Suriname already have achieved net negative emissions. France second ‘low-carbon national strategy’ adopted in 2020 has an objective of GHG neutrality by 2050. Net zero is also the basis of the recent revision of the official notional price of carbon for public investment in France (<a class="reference-link" href="#Quinet--2019">Quinet et al. 2019</a>). The Committee on Climate Change of the UK analyses sectoral options and concludes that delivering net zero GHG by 2050 is technically feasible but highly challenging (<a class="reference-link" href="#Committee%20on%20Climate%20Change--2019">Committee on Climate Change 2019</a>). For Germany, three steps to climate neutrality by 2050 are introduced: first, a 65% reduction of emissions by 2030; second, a complete switch to climate-neutral technologies, leading to a 95% cut in emissions, all relative to 1990 levels by 2050; and third balancing of residual emissions through carbon capture and storage (Prognos et al. 2020). In addition to the countries in Table 4.6, EU reported the net zero GHG emission pathways by 2050 under Green Deal (<a class="reference-link" href="#European%20Commission--2019">European Commission 2019</a>). China and South Korea, have made announcements of carbon neutrality before 2060 and net zero GHG emission by 2050, respectively (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2020a">UN 2020a</a>,b). In the case of Japan, the new target to net zero GHG emission by 2050 was announced in 2020 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2020c">UN 2020c</a>).

class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Since the 2000s, an increasing number of studies have quantified the emission pathways to mid-century by using national scale models. In the early stages, the national emission pathways were mainly assessed in the developed countries such as Germany, UK, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada, and USA. For example, the Enquete Commission in Germany identified robust and sustainable 80% emission reduction pathways (<a class="reference-link" href="#Deutscher%20Bundestag--2002">Deutscher Bundestag 2002</a>). In Japan, 2050 Japan Low-Carbon Society scenario team (2008) assessed the 70% reduction scenarios in Japan, and summarised the necessary measures to ‘Dozen Actions towards Low-Carbon Societies’.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Among developing countries, China, India, South Africa assessed their national emission pathways. For example, detailed analysis was undertaken to analyse pathways to China’s goal for carbon neutrality (<a class="reference-link" href="#EFC--2020">EFC 2020</a>). In South Africa, a <a class="reference-link" href="#Scenario%20Building%20Team--2007">Scenario Building Team (2007)</a> quantified the Long Term Mitigation Scenarios for South Africa.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Prior to COP21, most of the literature on mid-century mitigation pathways at the national level was dedicated to pathways compatible with a 2°C limit (see Box 4.2 for a discussion on the relationship between national mitigation pathways and global, long-term targets). After COP21 and the IPCC SR1.5, literature increasingly explored just transition to net zero emissions around 2050. This literature reflects on low-emissions development strategies (cognate with SDPS, <a class="section-link" data-title="Framing of Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>) and policies to get to net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions (Garg and Waisman 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><a href>Figure 4.2</a> provides a snapshot of this literature. For a selected set of countries, it shows the mid-century emission pathways at national scale that have been registered in the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) national mitigation scenario database built for the purpose of this Report (Annex III.3.3). Overall, the database contains scenarios for 50 countries. Total GHG emission are the most comprehensive information to assess the pathways on climate mitigation actions, but energy-related CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions are the most widely populated data in the scenarios. As a result, Figure 4.2 shows energy-related CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emission trajectories. Scenarios for EU countries show reduction trends even in the reference scenario, whereas developing countries and non-European developed countries such as Japan and USA show emissions increase in the reference.

The present section describes insights from this literature.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Overall, the literature shows that pathways considered consistent with below 2°C (&gt;67%) or 1.5°C (Box 4.2) – including inter alia 80% reduction of GHG emissions in 2050 relative to 1990 or 100% renewable electricity scenarios – are technically feasible (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lund--2009">Lund and Mathiesen 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mathiesen--2011">Mathiesen et al. 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Esteban--2014">Esteban and Portugal-Pereira 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Young--2017">Young and Brans 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Esteban--2018">Esteban et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Child--2019">Child et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hansen--2019">Hansen et al. 2019</a>). They entail increased end-use energy efficiency, significant increases in low-carbon energy, electrification, other new and transformative technologies in demand sectors, adoption of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to reduce gross emissions, and contribution to net negative emissions through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon sinks. For these pathways to be realised, the literature assumes higher carbon prices, combined in policy packages with a range of other policy measures.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The most recent literature also reflects on accelerated mitigation pathways aiming at reaching net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions or net zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Section 4.2.4 and Table 4.6; see Glossary entries on ‘net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions’ and ‘net zero GHG emissions’). Specific policies, measures and technologies are needed to reach such targets. These include, broadly, decarbonising electricity supply, including through low-carbon energy, radically more efficient use of energy than today; electrification of end-uses (including transport/electric vehicles); dramatically lower use of fossil fuels than today; converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; and setting ambitious targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Accelerated mitigation pathways differ by countries, depending inter alia on sources of emissions, mitigation opportunities and economic context.

Other benefits to SLCF reduction include reducing warming in the critical near term, which will slow amplifying feedbacks, reduce the risk of non-linear changes, and reduce long-term cumulative climate impacts – like sea-level rise – and mitigation costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hu--2017">Hu et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP%20and%20WMO--2011">UNEP and WMO 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018a">Rogelj et al. 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xu--2017">Xu and Ramanathan 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shindell--2012">Shindell et al. 2012</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="4.2.5.13"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.2.5.13</span> System Analysis Solutions Are Only Beginning to Be Recognised in Current Literature on Accelerated Mitigation Pathways, and Rarely Included in Existing National Policies or Strategies <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-24-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Most models and studies fail to address system impacts of widespread new technology deployment, for example: (i) material and resources needed for hydrogen production or additional emissions and energy required to transport hydrogen; or (ii) materials, resources, grid integration, and generation capacity expansion limits of a largely decarbonised power sector and electrified transport sector.

It must be noted upfront that computable equilibrium models, on which our assessments are mostly based, capture the impact of mitigation on GDP and other core economic variables while typically overlooking other effects that may matter (like improvements in air quality). Second, even though GDP (or better, GDP per capita) is not an indicator of welfare (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fleurbaey--2013">Fleurbaey and Blanchet 2013</a>), changes in GDP per capita across countries and over time are highly correlated with changes in welfare indicators in the areas of poverty, health, and education (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gable--2015">Gable et al. 2015</a>). The mechanisms linking mitigation to GDP outlined below would remain valid even with alternative indicators of well-being (<a class="section-link" data-title="Metrics of Well-being and their Relationship to Greenhouse Gas Emissions" href="/chapters/chapter-5#5.2.1">Section 5.2.1</a>). Third, another stream of literature criticises the pursuit of economic growth as a goal, instead advocating a range of alternatives and suggesting modelling of post-growth approaches to achieve rapid mitigation while improving social outcomes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hickel--2021">Hickel et al. 2021</a>). In the language of the present chapter, these alternatives constitute alternative development pathways.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>), for example (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nong--2017">Nong et al. 2017</a>) for Australia, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2013">Chen et al. 2013</a>) for Brazil, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dai--2016">Dai et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2017">Li et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dong--2018">Dong et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mu--2018a">Mu et al. 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhao--2018">Zhao et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cui--2019">Cui et al. 2019</a>) for China, (Álvarez-Espinosa et al. 2018) for Colombia, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fragkos--2017">Fragkos et al. 2017</a>) for the EU, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mittal--2018">Mittal et al. 2018</a>) for India, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fujimori--2019">Fujimori et al. 2019</a>) for Japan, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Veysey--2014">Veysey et al. 2014</a>) for Mexico, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pereira--2016">Pereira et al. 2016</a>) for Portugal, (Alton et al. 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Heerden--2016">van Heerden et al. 2016</a>) for South Africa, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chunark--2017">Chunark et al. 2017</a>) for Thailand, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Acar,%C2%A0S.%20and%C2%A0A.E.%20Yeldan--2016">Acar and Yeldan 2016</a>) for Turkey, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2018b">Roberts et al. 2018b</a>) for the UK, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2017">Zhang et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2019">Chen and Hafstead 2019</a>) for USA, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nong--2018">Nong 2018</a>) for Vietnam (<a href>Figure 4.4</a>). The downward relationship between mitigation effort and emissions is strong in studies up to 2030, much weaker for studies looking farther ahead. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation. It may be noted that none of the studies assessed above integrates the benefits of mitigation in terms of reduced impacts of climate change or lower adaptation costs. This is not surprising since these studies are at national or regional scale and do not extend beyond 2050, whereas the benefits depend on global emissions and primarily occur after 2050.

First, the carbon constraint imposes reduced use of a production factor (fossil energy), thus reducing GDP. In the simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households reduce their use of GHG-intensive goods and services in response to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive investment elsewhere (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fujimori--2019">Fujimori et al. 2019</a>), except in Keynesian models in which increased public investment actually boosts GDP (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pollitt--2015">Pollitt et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Landa%20Rivera--2016">Landa Rivera et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bulavskaya--2018">Bulavskaya and Reynès 2018</a>). Magnitude and duration of GDP loss depend on the stringency of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-GHG-intensive goods and services, assumptions about costs of low-carbon technologies and their evolution over time (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Duan--2018">Duan et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Meijl--2018">van Meijl et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cui--2019">Cui et al. 2019</a>) and decisions by trading partners, which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fragkos--2017">Fragkos et al. 2017</a>) (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">h</span><span class="•-Condensed-italic">igh agreement</span>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In the near term, presence of long-lived emissions intensive capital stock, and rigidities in the labour market (<a class="reference-link" href="#Devarajan--2011">Devarajan et al. 2011</a>) and other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP. In the mid-term, on the other hand, physical and human capital, technology, institutions, skills or location of households and activities are more flexible. The development of renewable energy may help create more employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill labour market (Helgenberger, S. et al., 2019). In addition, cumulative mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts of mitigation on GDP.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Country-level studies find that the negative impacts of mitigation on GDP can be reduced if pre-existing economic or institutional obstacles are removed in complement to the imposition of the carbon constraint (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). For example, if the carbon constraint takes the form of a carbon tax or of permits that are auctioned, the way the proceeds from the tax (or the revenues from the sales of permits) are used is critical for the overall macroeconomic impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2013">Chen et al. 2013</a>).

Most of the studies which find that GDP increases with mitigation in the near term precisely assume that the economy is initially not on the frontier. Making the economy more efficient – in other words, lifting the constraints that maintain the economy in an interior position – creates opportunities to simultaneously improve economic activity and reduce emissions.

Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact of scenarios with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) find relatively small (positive or negative) impacts on aggregate global employment that are more positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial losses for sectors and regions that today are heavily dependent on fossil fuels (Arndt et al. 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Huang--2019">Huang et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vandyck--2016">Vandyck et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jacobson--2019">Jacobson et al. 2019</a>). Among worker categories, low-skilled workers tend to suffer wage losses as they are more likely to have to reallocate, something that can come at a cost in the form of a wage cut (assuming that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who already work in the sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in labour taxes often leads to the most positive employment outcomes while lump-sum (uniform per-capita) transfers to households irrespective of income yield a more egalitarian outcome.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The results from country-level studies using CGE models tend be similar to those at global level. Aggregate employment impacts are small and may be positive especially if labour taxes are cut, see for example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Telaye--2019">Telaye et al.

On the other hand, sectoral reallocations away from fossil-dependent sectors may be substantial, see for example, Alton et al. (2014) for South Africa or <a class="reference-link" href="#Huang--2019">Huang et al. (2019)</a> for China. Targeting of investment to labour-intensive green sectors may generate the strongest employment gains, see, for example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Perrier--2018">Perrier and Quirion (2018)</a> for France, <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Meijl--2018">van Meijl et al.

First, the price increase in energy-intensive goods and services – including food (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hasegawa--2018">Hasegawa et al. 2018</a>) – associated with mitigation may affect poorer households disproportionally (Bento 2013), and increase the number of energy-poor (Berry 2019). Second, the mitigation may disproportionally affect low-skilled workers (see previous section). Distributional issues have been identified not only with explicit price measures (carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with subsidies for renewables (<a class="reference-link" href="#Borenstein--2016">Borenstein and Davis 2016</a>), and efficiency and emissions standards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Davis--2019">Davis and Knittel 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bruegge--2019">Bruegge et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Levinson--2019">Levinson 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fullerton--2019">Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Distributional implications, however, are context specific, depending on consumption patterns (initially and ease of adjusting them in response to price changes) and asset ownership (see for example analysis of energy prices in Indonesia by Renner et al. 2019). In an analysis of the distributional impact of carbon pricing based on household expenditure data for 87 low- and middle-income countries, <a class="reference-link" href="#Dorband--2019">Dorband et al. (2019)</a> find that, in countries with a per-capita income of up to USD15,000 per capita (purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted), carbon pricing has a progressive impact on income distribution and that there may be an inversely U-shaped relationship between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering carbon pricing regressive in high-income countries, in other words, in countries where the capacity to pursue compensatory policies tends to be relatively strong.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The literature finds that the detailed design of mitigation policies is critical for their distributional impacts (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Vogt-Schilb--2019">Vogt-Schilb et al. (2019)</a> suggest to turn to cash transfer programs, established as some of the most efficient tools for poverty reduction in developing countries. In an analysis of Latin America and the Caribbean, they find that allocation of 30% of carbon revenues would suffice to compensate poor and vulnerable households on average, leaving the rest for other uses. This policy tool is not only available in countries with relatively high per-capita incomes: in Sub-Saharan Africa, where per-capita incomes are relatively low, cash transfer programs have been implemented in almost all countries (Beegle et al. 2018, p. 57), and are found central to the success of energy subsidy reforms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rentschler--2017">Rentschler and Bazilian 2017</a>). In the same vein, Böhringer et al. (2021) finds that recycling of revenues from emissions pricing in equal amounts to every household appeals as an attractive strategy to mitigate regressive effects and thereby make stringent climate policy more acceptable on societal fairness grounds. However, distributional gains from such recycling may come at the opportunity cost of not reaping efficiency gains from reductions in the taxes that are most distortionary (Goulder et al. 2019).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Distributional concerns related to climate mitigation are also prevalent in developed countries, as demonstrated, for instance, by France’s recent yellow-vest movement, which was ignited by an increase in carbon taxes. It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the distributional effects of carbon pricing, it is not sufficient to consider vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at different incomes levels but also horizontal redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at similar incomes which is due to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel consumption). Compared to vertical redistribution, it is more difficult to devise policies that effectively address horizontal redistribution (Cronin et al. 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pizer--2019">Pizer and Sexton 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Douenne--2020">Douenne 2020</a>). However, it has been shown ex post that transfer schemes considering income levels and location could have protected or even improved the purchasing power of the bottom half of the population (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bureau--2019">Bureau et al. 2019</a>). Investments in public transportation may reduce horizontal redistribution if it makes it easier for households to reduce fossil fuel consumption when prices increase (see Sections 4.4.1.5 and 4.4.1.9). Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Charlier--2019">Charlier et al. 2019</a>). From a different angle, public acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have been enhanced via a public information campaign could have raised public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (<a class="reference-link" href="#Douenne--2020">Douenne and Fabre 2020</a>). (See <a class="section-link" data-title="Example: Embedding Carbon Finance in Broader Fiscal Reforms Offers a Way to Mitigate and Rethink the Social Contract" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1.8">Section 4.4.1.8</a> for a discussion of this and other factors that influence public support for carbon taxation.)</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="4.2.7"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.2.7</span>Obstacles to Accelerated Mitigation and How Overcoming Them Amounts to Shifts in Development Pathways <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-11-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As outlined in Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 there is improved understanding since AR5 of what accelerated mitigation would entail in the coming decades. A major finding is that accelerated mitigation pathways in the near to mid-term appear technically and economically feasible in most contexts. Chapter 4, however, cannot stop here. Section 4.2.2 has documented an important policy gap for current climate pledges, and Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this chapter shows an even larger ambition gap between current pledges and what would be needed in the near term to be on pathways consistent with below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. In other words, while the implementation of mitigation policies to achieve updated NDC almost doubles the mitigation efforts, and notwithstanding the widespread availability of the necessary technologies, this doubling of effort merely narrows the gap to pathways consistent with 2°C by at most 20%.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Obstacles to the implementation of accelerated mitigation pathways can be grouped in four main categories (Table 4.10). The first set of arguments can be understood through the lens of cost-benefit analysis of decision-makers, as they revolve around the following question: Are costs too high relative to benefits? More precisely, are the opportunity costs – in economics terms, what is being forfeited by allocating scarce resources to mitigation – justified by the benefits for the decision-maker (whether individual, firm, or nation)? This first set of obstacles is particularly relevant because accelerated mitigation pathways imply significant effort in the short-run, while benefits in terms of limited warming accrue later and almost wholly to other actors. However, as discussed in Sections 3.6 and 4.2.6, mitigation costs for a given mitigation target are not carved in stone. They strongly depend on numerous factors, including the way mitigation policies have been designed, selected, and implemented, the processes through which markets have been shaped by market actors and institutions, and nature of socially- and culturally-determined influences on consumer preferences. Hence, mitigation choices that might be expressed straightforwardly as techno-economic decisions are, at a deeper level, strongly conditioned by underlying structures of society.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A second set of likely obstacles in the short-term to accelerated mitigation revolves around undesirable distributional consequences, within and across countries. As discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Mitigation and Employment in the Short- and Medium-term" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.6.3">Section 4.2.6.3</a>, the distributional implications of climate policies depend strongly on their design, the way they are implemented, and on the context into which they are inserted. Distributional implications of climate policies have both ethics and equity dimensions, to determine what is desirable/acceptable by a given society in a given context, notably the relative power of different winners and losers to have their interests taken into account, or not, in the relevant decision-making processes. Like costs, distributional implications of accelerated mitigation are rooted in the underlying socio-political-institutional structures of a society.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A third set of obstacles are about technology availability and adoption. Lack of access even to existing cost-effective mitigation technologies remains an important issue, particularly for many developing countries, and even in the short-term. Though it relates most directly to techno-economic costs, technology availability raises broader issues related to the socio-technical systems within which innovation and adoption are embedded, and issues of technology availability are inherently issues of systemic failure (<a class="section-link" data-title="A Systemic View of Technological Innovation Processes" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.3">Section 16.3</a>). The underlying legal, economic and social structures of the economy are central to the different stages of socio-transition processes (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The last set of obstacles revolves around the unsuitability of existing structures to accelerated mitigation. We include here all forms of established structures, material (e.g., physical capital) or not (institutions, social norms, patterns of individual behaviour), that are potentially long-lived and limit the implementation of accelerated mitigation pathways. Typically, such structures exist for reasons other than climate change and climate mitigation, including the distribution of power among various actors. Modifying them in the name of accelerated climate mitigation thus requires to deal with other non-climate issues as well. For example, resolving the landlord-tenant dilemma, an institutional barrier to the deployment of energy efficiency in building, opens fundamental questions on private property in buildings.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Acommon thread in the discussion above is that the obstacles to accelerated mitigation are to a large degree rooted in the underlying structural features of societies. As a result, transforming those underlying structures can help to remove those obstacles, and thus facilitate the acceleration of mitigation. This remark is all the more important that accelerated mitigation pathways, while very different across countries, all share three characteristics: speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction achieving more ambitious targets. Transforming those underlying structures amounts to shifting a society’s development pathway (Figure 4.6). In the following Sections 3 and 4, we argue that it is thus necessary to recast accelerated mitigation in the broader context of shifting development pathways, and that doing so opens up additional opportunities to (i) overcome the obstacles outlined above, and also (ii) combine climate mitigation with other development objectives.</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer027"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" id="figure-4-6" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_4_6.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 4.6 | Obstacles to mitigation (top panel) and measures to remove these obstacles and enable shift in development pathways</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"> (lower panel). </span></span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table 4.10 | Objections to accelerated mitigation and where they are assessed in</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">the WG3 report. </span></span></p><table class="IPCC-Table" id="table011"><colgroup><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-35"><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-50"><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-51"></colgroup><thead><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-52"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue-" lang="en-US">Category</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue-" lang="en-US">Main dimensions</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue-" lang="en-US">Location in AR6 WGIII report where objection is assessed and solutions are discussed</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-18"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Body-row"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Costs of mitigation</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Body-row"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Marginal, sectoral or macroeconomic costs of mitigation too high;

A society’s development pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety of perspectives, capturing a range of possible features, trends, processes, and mechanisms. It can be examined in terms of specific quantitative indicators, such as population, urbanisation level, life expectancy, literacy rate, GDP, carbon dioxide emission rate, average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described with reference to trends and shifts in broad socio-political or cultural features, such as democratisation, liberalisation, colonisation, globalisation, consumerism, etc. Or, it can be described in a way that highlights and details a particular domain of interest; for example, as an ‘economic pathway’, ‘technological pathway’, ‘demographic pathway’, or others. Any such focused description of a pathway is more limited, by definition, than the general and encompassing notion of a development pathway.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Development pathways represent societal evolution over time, and can be assessed retrospectively and interpreted in a historical light, or explored prospectively by anticipating and assessing alternative future pathways. Development pathways, and prospective development pathways in particular, can reflect societal objectives, as in ‘low-emission development pathways’, ‘climate-resilient development pathways’, ‘sustainable development pathways’, ‘inclusive development pathway’, and as such can embed normative assumptions or preferences, or can reflect potential dystopian futures to be avoided. A national development plan (<a class="section-link" data-title="Implications of Development Pathways for Mitigation and Mitigative Capacity" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>) is a representation of a possible development pathway for a given society reflecting its objectives, as refracted through its development planning process.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">One approach for exploring shifts in future development pathways is through scenarios. Some examples of scenario exercises in the literature are provided in Table 4.11.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Different narratives of development pathways can have distinct and even competing focuses such as economic growth, shifts in industrial structure, technological determinism, and can embody alternative framings of development itself (from growth to well-being, see Chapter 5), and of sustainable development in particular (Sections 1.6 and 17.1). Scenario exercises are structured undertakings to explore alternative future development pathways, often drawing on stakeholder input and accepting the deep and irreducible uncertainty inherent in societal development into the future (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schweizer--2012">Schweizer and Kriegler 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kahane--2012">Kahane 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Raskin--2020">Raskin and Swart 2020</a>). The results of scenario explorations, including modelling exercises, thus help clarify the characteristics of a particular future pathway, in light of a particular set of assumptions and choice of indicators for assessment. Processes of developing scenarios can inform choices by decision makers of various kinds.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Scenarios are useful to clarify societal objectives, understand constraints, and explore future shifts. Scenario exercises are effective when they enable multi-dimensional assessment, and accommodate divergent normative viewpoints (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kowarsch--2017">Kowarsch et al. 2017</a>). Such processes might take into account participants’ explicit and implicit priorities, values, disciplinary backgrounds, and world views. The process of defining and describing a society’s development pathway contributes to the ongoing process of understanding, explaining and defining the historical and contemporary meaning and significance of a society. The imagination of facilitated stakeholder process combined with the rigour of modelling helps improve understanding of constraints, trade-offs, and choices. ‘Scenario analysis offers a structured approach for illuminating the vast range of possibilities. A scenario is a story, told in words and numbers, describing the way events might unfold.

The 17 SDGs are integrated and imply that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and over time. These priorities are strongly linked to local contexts, and depend on which dimensions of improvements in the well-being of people are considered the most urgent.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Development priorities are reflected in the decisions that actors within societies make, such as policy choices by governments and parliaments at all levels, votes over competing policy platforms by citizens, or selection of issues that non-state actors push for. Multiple objectives range from poverty eradication to providing energy access, addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving health, cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining growth and providing jobs, among others. For example, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across many countries, such as Brazil (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grottera--2017">Grottera et al. 2017</a>), Indonesia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Irfany--2017">Irfany and Klasen 2017</a>), India (GoI 2015), South Africa (<a class="reference-link" href="#Winkler--2018">Winkler 2018</a>) and other low- and middle-income countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dorband--2019">Dorband et al. 2019</a>).

The development priorities of many poor countries and communities with low capacities to adapt, has been focused more on reducing poverty, providing basic infrastructure, education and improving health, rather than on mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chimhowu--2019">Chimhowu et al. 2019</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="4.3.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.3.2.2</span>The Nature of National Development Plans Is Changing <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-34-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Governments are increasingly resorting to the development of national plans to build institutions, resources, and risk/shock management capabilities to guide national development. The number of countries with a national development plan has more than doubled, from about 62 in 2006 (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2007">World Bank 2007</a>) to 134 plans published between 2012 and 2018 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chimhowu--2019">Chimhowu et al. 2019</a>). The comeback of planning may be linked to increased consideration given to sustainability, which is by construction forward-looking and far ranging, and therefore requires state and civil society to prepare and implement plans at all levels of governance. Governments are increasingly engaging in the development and formulation of national plans in an organised, conscious and continual attempt to select the best available alternatives to achieve specific goals.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A systematic assessment of 107 national development plans and 10 country case studies provides useful insights regarding the type and content of the plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chimhowu--2019">Chimhowu et al. 2019</a>). development plans are increasingly focusing on mobilising action across multiple actors and multiple dimensions to enhance resilience and improve the ability to undertake stronger mitigation actions. Various initiatives such as the World Summit for Children in 1990; the Heavily Indebted Poor Country initiative that started offering debt relief in exchange for commitments by beneficiary states to invest in health, education, nutrition and poverty reduction in 1996; and push towards Comprehensive Development Frameworks seem to have catalysed the development of national actions plans across countries to estimate, measure and track investments and progress towards SDGs.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the earlier ones in terms of their approach. Complexity science has over the years argued for new forms of planning based on contingency, behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Colander--2016">Colander and Kupers 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ramalingam--2013">Ramalingam, 2013</a>), and new plans have increasingly focused on increasing resilience of individuals, organisations and systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hummelbrunner--2013">Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013</a>). Finally, alongside short-term (typically five year) plans with operational purpose, countries have also expressed visions of their development pathways over longer time horizons, via, for example, Voluntary National Reviews submitted in the context of the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">National development plans are also increasingly more holistic in their approach, linking closely with SDGs and incorporating climate action in their agendas. For instance, the Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI), launched in 2017 by the Government of Indonesia, seeks to identify the development policies that can help Indonesia achieve multiple (social, economic, and environmental) goals simultaneously along with preserving and improving the country’s natural resources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bappenas--2019">Bappenas 2019</a>). Likewise, Nepal’s Fifteenth Plan (five-year) recognises the need for climate mitigation and adaptation and corresponding access to international finance and technologies. The plan suggests mobilisation of foreign aid in the climate change domain in line with Nepal’s priorities and its inclusion in the country’s climate-friendly development programs as the key opportunities in this regard (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nepal--2020">Nepal 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">China’s development plans have evolved over time from being largely growth oriented, and geared largely towards the objectives of addressing poverty, improving health, education and public well-being to also including modernisation of agriculture, industry and infrastructure, new forms of urbanisation and a clear intent of focusing on innovation and new drivers of development (Central Compilation &amp; Translation Press 2016). China’s 14th Five Year Plan not only seeks to promote high quality development in all aspects and focus on strengthening the economy in the global industrial chain, but also includes a vision of an ‘ecological civilisation’, which had been developed (<a class="reference-link" href="#CPC-CC--2015">CPC-CC 2015</a>) and analysed earlier (<a class="reference-link" href="#He--2016">He 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xiao--2017">Xiao and Zhao 2017</a>).

Accordingly, there was a thrust towards enhancing productivity of the agricultural and industrial sectors. While the main focus was on maintaining high economic growth and industrial productivity, poverty eradication, employment and inclusive growth remained important priorities. The National Action Plan on Climate Change with eight National Missions focusing on mitigation as well as adaptation was launched in 2008 integrating climate change considerations in planning and decision-making (<a class="reference-link" href="#MoEF--2008">MoEF 2008</a>). The 12th Five-Year Plan (2012–2017) also brought in a focus on sustainability and mentioned the need for faster, sustainable and inclusive growth. The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) was set up in 2017 replacing the erstwhile Planning Commission, with a renewed focus towards bringing innovation, technology, enterprise and efficient management together at the core of policy formulation and implementation. However, while India has moved away from its Five-Year Plans, decision-making is more dynamic, with a number of sector-specific initiatives and targets focused on integrating sustainability dimensions through a series of policies and measures supporting resource efficiency, improved energy access, infrastructure development, low-carbon options and building resilient communities, among other objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#MoEFCC--2018">MoEFCC 2018</a>, 2021). India’s overall development pathway currently has a strong focus on achieving robust and inclusive growth to ensure balanced development across all regions and states and across sectors. There is a thrust on embracing new technologies while fostering innovation and upskilling, modernisation of agriculture, improving regional and interpersonal equity, bridging the gap between public and private sector performance, by focusing on efficient delivery of public services, rooting out corruption and black economy, formalising the economy and expanding the tax base, improving the ease of doing business, nursing the stressed commercial banking sector back to a healthy state, and stopping leakages through direct benefit transfers, among other measures (GoI 2015, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#MoEFCC--2021">MoEFCC 2021</a>).</p><div class="h3-container" id="4.3.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.3.2.3</span>Development Pathways Shape Emissions and Capacities to Mitigate <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-35-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Analysis in the mitigation literature often frames mitigation policy as having development co-benefits, the main objective being climate stabilisation.

Urbanisation, and more broadly spatial patterns of development, are in turned driven to a large part by development choices, such as, inter alia, spatial provision of infrastructure and services, choices regarding the agriculture and forestry sector, land-use policies, support to regional/local development, among others (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2009">World Bank 2009</a>). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Dorin--2017">Dorin (2017)</a> points out that if agriculture sectors in Africa and India follow the same development path that developed countries have followed in the past, namely increased labour productivity through enlargement and robotisation of farms, then unprecedented emigrations of rural workers towards cities or foreign countries will ensue, with large-scale social, economic and environmental consequences.

However, the use of narrow approaches or simple methods of studying the relationships of income inequality and emissions by looking at correlations, may miss important linkages. For example, the influence of inequality on social values such as status and civic mindedness and non-political interests that shape environmental policy can influence overall consumption and its environmental impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berthe,%C2%A0A.%20and%C2%A0L.%20Elie--2015">Berthe and Elie 2015</a>).

Precisely, IMP1.5-SP (Shifting Pathways) and 1.5-Ren (Renewables) lead to the same long-term temperature, but differ in underlying socio-economic conditions. The former is based on Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 1 (sustainable development), whereas the latter is based on SSP2 (middle of the road). Comparing 1.5-Ren to 1.5-SP can thus be interpreted as a numerical translation of trying the reach the same long-term temperature goal without and with shifting development pathways towards sustainability. Data shows that the global price of carbon necessary to remain on target is 40–50% lower in the latter relative to the former, thus indicating that mitigation is cheaper with a shift in development pathway towards sustainability. Other cost indicators (e.g. consumption loss or GDP loss) tell the same story. Since both IMPs were computed using the same underlying model, the comparison is even more robust.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In sum, development pathways can lead to different emission levels and different capacities and opportunities to mitigate (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>).

Back-casting is a normative approach where modellers construct desirable futures and specify upfront targets and then find out possible pathways to attain these targets (IPCC et al. 2001).

In back casting, the long-term national development objectives remain the key benchmarks guiding the model dynamics and the global climate goal is interfaced to realise the co-benefits. The models then delineate the roadmap of national actions such that the national goals are achieved with a comprehensive understanding of the full costs and benefits of low-carbon development (often including the costs of adaptation and impacts from residual climate change). Back-casting modelling exercises show that aligning development and climate actions could result in much lower ‘social cost of carbon’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shukla--2008">Shukla et al. 2008</a>).

4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than GHG mitigation. They are generally conceived and implemented in the pursuit of overall societal development objectives, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. However, they can have major influence on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as necessary tools if mitigation options are to be significantly broadened and accelerated (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). The example of the UK shows how accelerated mitigation through dietary changes require a wide set of efforts to shift underlying drivers of behaviour. In this case, multiple forces have interacted to lead to reduced meat consumption, including health attitudes, animal welfare concerns, and an increasing focus on climate and other environmental impacts of livestock production, along with corporate investment in market opportunities, and technological developments in meat alternatives (Box 5.5).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Other historic cases that are unrelated to recent mitigation efforts might be more appropriate examples of major socio-technical shifts that were largely driven by intentional, coherent intentional policy initiatives across numerous domains to meet multiple objectives. The modernisation of agriculture in various national contexts fits such a mold. In the USA, for example, major government investments in agricultural innovation through the creation of agricultural universities and support for research provided advances in the technological basis for modernisation. A network of agricultural extension services accelerated the popularization and uptake of modern methods. Infrastructure investments in irrigation and drainage made production more viable, and investment in roadways and rail for transport supported market formation. Agricultural development banks made credit available, and government subsidies improved the profitability for farmers and agricultural corporations. Public campaigns were launched to modify food habits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ferleger--2000">Ferleger 2000</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Further examples of SDPS across many different systems and sectors are elaborated across this report. Concrete examples assessed in this chapter include high employment and low emissions structural change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social contract, combining housing policies to deliver both housing and transport mitigation, and change economic, social and spatial patterns of development of the agriculture sector provide the basis for sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation (Sections 4.4.1.7–4.4.1.10). These examples differ by context. Examples in other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole economies and societies (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter, Section 5.8, Box 6.2, Sections 8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2 and 10.4.1, and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16).

What do we mean by development pathways?</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In the present report, development pathways refer to patterns of development resulting from multiple decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether in the Global North or the Global South follows its own pattern of development (Figure 1.6). Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities). By extension, the concept can also be applied to sectors and systems (e.g., the development pathway of the agricultural sector or of industrial systems).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB">2. Why do development pathways matter in a report about mitigation?</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H2" lang="en-GB">2a. Past development pathways determine both today’s GHG emissions and the set of opportunities to reduce emissions</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Development pathways drive GHG emissions for a large part (Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). For example, different social choices and policy packages with regard to land use and associated rents will result in human settlements with different spatial patterns, different types of housing markets and cultures, and different degrees of inclusiveness, and thus different demand for transport services and associated GHG emissions (Sections 8.3.1 and 10.2.1).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways is unlikely to achieve rapid and deep emission reductions (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement</span>). For example, investments in long-lived infrastructure, including energy supply systems, could lock-in high emissions pathways and risk making deep decarbonisation and sustainable policies more difficult and expensive.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Development pathways also determine the set of tools available to mitigate climate change (Figure 4.7). For example, the capacity of households to move closer to their workplace, in response to, for example, a price signal on carbon and thus on gasoline, depends on rents, which themselves depend on the spatial patterns of development of human settlements (<a class="section-link" data-title="Trends in Urban Land Use and the Built Environment" href="/chapters/chapter-8#8.3.1">Section 8.3.1</a>). Said differently, mitigation costs depend on past development choices. Similarly, development pathways determine the enablers and levers available for adaptation (AR6 WGII, Chapter 18) and for achieving other SDGs.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy instruments (e.g., carbon tax, emission quotas, technological norms, etc.) may not be able to limit emissions to a degree sufficient for deep decarbonisation or only at very high economic and social costs.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Policies to shift development pathways, on the contrary, make mitigation policies more effective. For example, policies that prioritise non-car transit, or limit rents close to work places would make it easier for households to relocate in response to a price signal on transport, and thus makes the same degree of mitigation achievable at lower economic and social cost.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H2" lang="en-GB">2b. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between development objectives and mitigation</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Second, societies pursue a variety of development objectives, of which protecting the Earth’s climate is part. The SDGs provide a global mapping of these goals. Absent climate mitigation, our collective ability to achieve the SDGs in 2030 and to sustain them beyond 2030 is likely to be compromised, even if adaptation measures are put in place (AR6 WGII).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of other development objectives can go hand in hand, in the near-, mid- and long-term (Sections 3.7, 6.7.7, 7.6.5, 8.2, 9.8, 10.1.1, 11.5.3 and 17.3, and Figures 3.40 and 12.1). For example, transitions from coal-based power to lower-emissions electricity generation technologies and from internal combustion engine to lower-carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local air pollution (Box 6.2 and <a class="section-link" data-title="Light-duty Vehicles for Passenger Transport" href="/chapters/chapter-10#10.4.1">Section 10.4.1</a>). Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also delivers significant health benefits (Sections 9.8.1 and 9.8.2).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-continued-overleaf--subhead-" lang="en-GB">Cross-Chapter Box 5</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Careful design of mitigation policies is critical to achieving these synergies (<a class="section-link" data-title="Integrating Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.8">Section 13.8</a>). Integrated policies can support the creation of synergies between climate change goals and other SDGs. For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are combined with electrification and clean renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained (Figure SPM.8 and <a class="section-link" data-title="Services, Well-being and Equity in Demand-side Mitigation" href="/chapters/chapter-5#5.2">Section 5.2</a>). These include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air and benefits from enhanced mobility (Sections 8.2, 8.4 and 4.4.1.9).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Policy design can also manage trade-offs, for example through policy measures as part of just transitions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Key Barriers and Enablers of the Transition: Synthesising Results" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.4">Section 17.4</a>). However, even with good policy design, decisions about mitigation actions, and the timing and scale thereof, may entail trade-offs with the achievement of other national development objectives in the near-, mid- and long term. In the near term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution, but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green spaces within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and push low income residents outside the city (<a class="section-link" data-title="Economic Development, Competitiveness, and Equity" href="/chapters/chapter-8#8.2.2">Section 8.2.2</a>). In the mid- and long-term, large-scale deployment of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation (Sections 3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2 and 12.5.3). Conflicts between mitigation and other development objectives can act as an impediment to climate action (<a class="section-link" data-title="Integrating Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.8">Section 13.8</a>). Climate change is the result of decades of unsustainable energy production, land-use, production and consumption patterns, as well as governance arrangements and political economic institutions that lock in resource-intensive development patterns (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). Reframing development objectives and shifting development pathways towards sustainability can help transform these patterns and practices, allowing space for transitions transforming unsustainable systems (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>) (Chapter 17, Executive Summary).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Prioritising is one way to manage trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards sustainability as they expand the range of tools available to simultaneously achieve multiple development objectives, including mitigation. In the city example of Section 2a, a carbon tax alone would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high emissions transport modes poorer or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing and provision of safe low-carbon mobility could both facilitate equitable access to housing (a major development objective in many countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), driven by targeted policies, investment and enabling socio-cultural and behavioural change, would reduce pressure on supply side mitigation need, hence limiting pressure on water and food and the achievement of associated SDGs. Some studies assume Western European lifestyle as a reference for the Global North and an improvement in the living standard for the Global South to reduce energy demand and emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grubler--2018">Grubler et al. 2018</a>), while others explore a transformative change in the Global North to achieve a decent living standard for all (Bertram et al. 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Millward-Hopkins--2020">Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Sustainable Development, Mitigation and Avoided Impacts" href="/chapters/chapter-3#3.7">Section 3.7</a>.8). For example, in the UK, interaction between multiple behavioural, socio-cultural, and corporate drivers including NGO campaigns, social movements and product innovations resulted in an observed decline in meat consumption (Sections 5.4 and 5.6.4).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB">3. What does shifting development pathways towards sustainability entail?</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifting development pathways towards sustainability implies making transformative changes that disrupt existing developmental trends. Such choices would not be marginal (Stern 2009), but include technology adoption, infrastructure availability and use, and socio-behavioural factors (Chapter 5).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">These include creating new infrastructure, sustainable supply chains, institutional capacities for evidence-based and integrated decision-making, financial alignment towards low-carbon socially responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour and norms to support shifts away from fossil-fuel consumption (<a class="reference-link" href="#Green--2018">Green and Denniss 2018</a>). Adopting multi-level governance modes, tackling corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key for aligning and supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifting development pathways entails fundamental changes in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems. It also requires changes in behaviour and social practices. Overcoming inertia and locked-in practices may face considerable opposition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2017">Geels et al. 2017</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Technological and Infrastructural Drivers" href="/chapters/chapter-5#5.4.5">Section 5.4.5</a>). The durability of carbon intensive transport modes and electricity generating infrastructures increase the risk of lock-in to high emissions pathways, as these comprise not just consumer practices, but sunk costs in infrastructure, supporting institutions and rules (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seto--2016">Seto et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mattioli--2020">Mattioli et al. 2020</a>). Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities, as well as the availability of financing to enable such a transition (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Current Financial Flows" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.3">Section 15.3</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-continued-overleaf--subhead-" lang="en-GB">Cross-Chapter Box 5</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB">4. How to shift development pathways?</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifting development paths is complex. If history is any guide, practices that can easily supplant existing systems and are clearly profitable move fastest (<a class="reference-link" href="#Griliches--1957">Griliches 1957</a>). Changes that involve ‘dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components’ take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Conley--2010">Conley and Udry 2010</a>), even when they promise large gains (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pezzoni--2019">Pezzoni et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Yet despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector and social stakeholders. For example, fundamentally different responses to the first oil shock shifted then-comparable economies on to different energy sector development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sathaye--2009">Sathaye et al. 2009</a>). More recent examples have shown evidence of voluntary transitions for example, advanced lighting in Sweden, improved cook-stoves in China, liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia or ethanol vehicles in Brazil (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2016">Sovacool 2016</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">There is no one-size-fits-all recipe for shifting development pathways. However, the following insights can be drawn from past experience and scenarios of possible future development pathways (<a class="section-link" data-title href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a>). For example, policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and affordable reduce transport costs for low- and middle-income households, and also reduce transport emissions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Example: Combining Housing Policies With Carbon Taxation Can Deliver Both Housing and Mitigation in the Transport Sector" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1.9">Section 4.4.1.9</a>). Shifts in development pathways result from both sustained political interventions and bottom-up changes in public opinion. No single sector or policy action is enough to achieve this. Coordinated policy mixes would need to coordinate multiple actors – in other words, individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors – to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pettifor--2020">Pettifor 2020</a>). One example was the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Subsidy (‘Zero Kero’) Program in Indonesia which harnessed creative policy design to shift to cleaner energy by overcoming existing private interests. The objective of decreasing fiscal expenditures on domestic kerosene subsidies by replacing it with LPG was achieved by harnessing distribution networks of existing providers supported by government subsidised provision of equipment and subsidised pricing (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 13).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements or informal lifestyle changes underpins system change (Sections 5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5.3 and 13.5).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Sectoral transitions that aspire to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives, and deploy a diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Figure 13.6). Context specific governance conditions can significantly enable or disable sectoral transitions, and play a determinative role in whether a sectoral transition leads to a shift in development pathway. For example, if implemented policies to tackle fuel poverty target the most socially vulnerable households, this can help address barriers poor households face in undertaking building retrofits. In the EU-28, it has been shown that accelerated energy efficiency policies coupled with strong social policies targeting the most vulnerable households, can help reduce the energy demand in residential sector, and deliver additional co-benefits of avoided premature deaths and reduced health impacts (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Mitigation Actions in Buildings and Health Impacts" href="/chapters/chapter-9#9.8.2">Section 9.8.2</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Literature suggests that through equitable resource distribution, high levels of human development can be provided at moderate energy and carbon levels by changing consumption patterns and redirecting systems in the direction of more sustainable resource use, suggesting that a special effort can be made in the near term for those on higher incomes who account for a disproportionate fraction of global emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Millward-Hopkins--2020">Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hickel--2021">Hickel et al. 2021</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Inequity in Access to Basic Energy Use and Services" href="/chapters/chapter-5#5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</a> and Figure 5.14).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">The necessary transformational changes are likely to be more acceptable if rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and society within which they take place (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2012">Dubash 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2013">Jones et al. 2013</a>) and may enable a new social contract to address a complex set of inter-linkages across sectors, classes and the whole economy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fleurbaey--2018">Fleurbaey et al. 2018</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Taking advantage of windows of opportunity and disruptions to mindsets and socio-technical systems could advance deeper transformations.

How can shifts in development pathways be implemented by actors in different contexts?</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability is a shared aspiration. Yet since countries differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent needs in terms of facilitating the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities (Sections 4.3.2 and 17.4). The appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In some developed countries and communities, affluence leads to high levels of consumption and emissions across sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mazur--1974">Mazur and Rosa 1974</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wiedmann--2020">Wiedmann et al. 2020</a>).

As highlighted above, despite 30 years of UNFCCC and growing contributions by non-state actors, the emissions gap keeps growing (Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). Mitigation conceived as incremental change is not enough. Meeting ambitious mitigation goals entails rapid, non-marginal changes in production and consumption patterns (Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.5). Taking another approach, we have seen in <a class="section-link" data-title="Shifting Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3">Section 4.3</a> that shifting development pathways broadens the scope for mitigation (Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2) and offers more opportunities than mitigation alone to combine mitigation with the realisation of other SDGs (<a class="section-link" data-title="Framing of Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A practical way forward is to combine shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). This means introducing multi-objective policy packages and sequences with climate and development components that both target mitigation directly and create the conditions for shifts in development pathways that will help accelerate further mitigation down the line, and meet other development objectives. Since development pathways result from myriad decisions from multiple actors (<a class="section-link" data-title="Framing of Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>), coordination across countries and with non-state actors is essential.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The literature does not provide a handbook on how to accomplish the above. However, analysis of past experience as well as understanding of how societies function yield insights that the present section aims at presenting. Human history has seen multiple transformation of economies due to path-breaking innovations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2018">Michaelowa et al. 2018</a>), like the transformation of the energy system from traditional biomass to fossil fuels or from steam to electricity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fouquet--2010">Fouquet 2010</a>, 2016a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2016">Sovacool 2016</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Fouquet--2016b">Fouquet (2016b)</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="#Smil--2016">Smil (2016)</a> argue that even the most rapid global transformations have taken several decades. Enabling transformational change implies to create now the conditions that lead to that transformation (<a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%ADaz--2019">Díaz et al. 2019</a>). The starting point is that there is no single factor determining such a transformation. Rather a range of enabling conditions can combine in a co-evolutionary process. Amongst the conditions that have been cited in the literature are higher levels of innovation, multilevel governance, transformative policy regimes or profound behavioural transformation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rockstr%C3%B6m--2017">Rockström et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2018">Geels et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kriegler--2018">Kriegler et al. 2018</a>). It might be possible to put in place some of the above conditions rapidly, while others may take longer, thereby requiring an early start.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The present chapter uses the set of enabling conditions identified in the IPCC SR1.5 report, namely policy, governance and institutional capacity, finance, behaviour and lifestyles and innovation and technology (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al. 2018</a>). As Figure 4.8 illustrates, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">public policies</span> are required to foster both accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways. They are also vital to guide and provide the other enabling conditions (compare Table 4.12). Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity facilitate the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways, with the potential to achieve multiple mitigation and development objectives. Finance is required both to accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. <a class="section-link" data-title="Investment and finance" href="/chapters/chapter-15">Chapter 15</a> argues that near term actions to shift the financial system over the next decade (2021–2030) are critically important and feasible, and that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities to scale up financing from billions to trillions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mawdsley--2018">Mawdsley 2018</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Development of Local Capital Markets" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.7">Section 15.6.7</a>). As discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="What Is to Be Done to Accelerate Mitigation?" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.5">Section 4.2.5</a>, accelerated mitigation pathways encompass both rapid deployment of new technologies such as CCS or electric vehicles, as well as changes in consumption patterns: rapid deployment of mitigation <span class="•-Condensed-italic">technology</span> and <span class="•-Condensed-italic">behaviour change</span> are thus two enabling conditions to accelerated mitigation. Dynamics of deployment of technologies are relatively well known, pointing to specific, short-term action to accelerate innovation and deployment (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16), whereas dynamics of collective behaviour change is less well understood.

The next sections are dedicated to the conditions that facilitate shifts in development pathways and accelerated mitigation: governance and institutions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Governance and Institutional Capacity" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1.3">Section 4.4.1.3</a>), financial resources (<a class="section-link" data-title="Channelling Financial Resources" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1.4">Section 4.4.1.4</a>), behaviour change (<a class="section-link" data-title="Changing Behaviour and Lifestyles" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1.5">Section 4.4.1.5</a>) and innovation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Fostering Technological Innovation" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1.6">Section 4.4.1.6</a>).

A shift in development pathways that fosters accelerated mitigation may best be achieved through integrated actions that comprise policies in support of the broader SDG agenda, based on country-specific priorities (Sections 4.3.2, 13.8 and 13.9). These may include for example, fiscal policies, or integrating industrial (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nilsson--2021">Nilsson et al. 2021</a>) and energy policies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fragkos--2021">Fragkos et al. 2021</a>) with climate policies. Similarly, sectoral transitions that aspire to shifting development pathways towards sustainability often have multiple objectives, and deploy a diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Cross-Chapter Box 5).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Because low-carbon transitions are political processes, analyses are needed <span class="•-Condensed-italic">of </span> policy as well as <span class="•-Condensed-italic">for</span> policy (<a class="section-link" data-title="Policy Instruments and Evaluation " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.6">Section 13.6</a>). Political scientists have developed a number of theoretical models that both <span class="•-Condensed-italic">explain</span> policy-making processes and provide useful insights for <span class="•-Condensed-italic">influencing</span> those processes. Case studies of successes and failures in sustainable development and mitigation offer equally important insights. Both theoretical and empirical analysis reinforce the argument that single policy instruments are not sufficient (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement</span>). Policymakers might rather mobilise a range of policies, such as financial instruments (taxes, subsidies, grants, loans), regulatory instruments (standards, laws, performance targets) and processual instruments (demonstration projects, network management, public debates, consultations, foresight exercises, roadmaps) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vo%C3%9F--2007">Voß et al. 2007</a>). Policies can be designed to focus on limiting or phasing out high-carbon technology. The appropriate mix is likely to vary between countries and domains, depending on political cultures and stakeholder configurations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2016">Rogge and Reichardt 2016</a>), but is likely to include a combination of: (i) standards, nudges and information to encourage low-carbon technology adoption and behavioural change; (ii) economic incentives to reward low-carbon investments; (iii) supply-side policy instruments including for fossil fuel production (to complement demand-side climate policies) and (iv) innovation support and strategic investment to encourage systemic change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grubb--2014">Grubb 2014</a>). These approaches can be mutually reinforcing. For example, carbon pricing can incentivise low-carbon innovation, while targeted support for emerging niche technologies can make them more competitive encourage their diffusion and ultimately facilitate a higher level of carbon pricing. Similarly, the success of feed-in tariffs in Germany only worked as well as it did because it formed part of a broader policy mix including ‘supply-push’ mechanisms such as subsidies for research and ‘systemic measures’ such as collaborative research projects and systems of knowledge exchange (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2015">Rogge et al. 2015</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="4.4.1.3"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.4.1.3</span>Governance and Institutional Capacity <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-40-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Governance for climate mitigation and shifting development pathways is enhanced when tailored to national and local contexts.

To do so, the tax base was broadened, including through environmental and carbon taxation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sterner--2007">Sterner 2007</a>). Once in place, the carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and its base broadened (<a class="reference-link" href="#Criqui--2019">Criqui et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The future potential for using carbon taxation as a way to provide space for fiscal reform has been highlighted in the so-called ‘green fiscal reform’ literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vogt-Schilb--2019">Vogt-Schilb et al. 2019</a>). The potential is large, since only 13% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing schemes in 2019 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Watts--2019">Watts et al. 2019</a>) and since many countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon prices hope to promote. In 2018, the global subsidy value amounted to USD427 billion, some 10 times the payment for carbon use (<a class="reference-link" href="#Watts--2019">Watts et al. 2019</a>). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal space varies strongly across countries given differences in terms of current carbon prices and fuel subsidies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing may be explained by the fact that most of the gains occur in the future and depend on actions across the globe, making them seem abstract and unpredictable, whereas the costs in the form of higher carbon prices are immediate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karapin--2016">Karapin 2016</a>). Furthermore, the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear to the public who, in addition, may not trust that the government will use budgetary savings according to stated plans. The latter may be due to various factors, including a history of limited government commitment and corruption (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chadwick--2017">Chadwick 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maestre-Andr%C3%A9s--2019">Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The literature reports limited systematic evidence based on ex post <span class="•-Condensed-italic"></span> analysis of the performance of carbon pricing – carbon taxes and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading systems (ETSs) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haites--2018">Haites 2018</a>). Performance assessment is complicated by the effect of other policies and exogenous factors. <a class="reference-link" href="#Haites--2018">Haites (2018)</a> suggests that since 2008, other policies have probably contributed more to emission reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to achieve mitigation objectives. Emissions under ETSs have declined, with the exception of four systems without emissions caps (ibid). Every jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other policies that affect its GHG emissions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">To help policymakers overcome obstacles, research has reviewed the international experience from carbon pricing reforms. Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, equivalent to the elimination of negative carbon prices, have been more successful when they have included complementary and transparent measures that enjoy popular support, accompanied by a strong communications component that explains the measures and stresses their benefits (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rentschler--2017">Rentschler and Bazilian 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maestre-Andr%C3%A9s--2019">Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Part of the losses (and related calls for compensation or exemptions) due to carbon pricing are related to the fact that it hurts the competitiveness of sectors that face imports from countries with lower carbon prices, leading to ‘carbon leakage’ if carbon-intensive production (and related jobs) migrates from countries with relatively high carbon prices. Some research suggests that evidence that a border carbon tax (or adjustment), set on the basis of the carbon content of the import, including a downward adjustment on the basis of any carbon payments (taxes or other) already made before entry, could reduce carbon leakage while also raising additional revenue and encouraging carbon pricing in the exporting country (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cosbey--2019">Cosbey et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), as well as momentum from climate actions by other countries and international climate agreements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karapin--2016">Karapin 2016</a>; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rentschler--2017">Rentschler and Bazilian 2017</a>). In countries that export carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers or earmarked for areas with positive environmental effects (e.g., Bachus et al. (2019) for Belgium, and <a class="reference-link" href="#Beiser-McGrath,%C2%A0L.F.%20and%C2%A0T.%20Bernauer--2019">Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer (2019)</a> for Germany and the USA), as well as on the difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic consequences thereof) associated with the introduction of such instruments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pereira--2016">Pereira et al. 2016</a>). Similarly, ‘best practices’ have been drawn from past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rentschler--2017">Rentschler and Bazilian 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2017">Sovacool 2017</a>). Specific policies, however, depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, employment, and trade, and institutional structure (including the functioning of markets and government capacity) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kettner--2019">Kettner et al. 2019</a>). As noted in <a class="section-link" data-title="Implications of Accelerated Mitigation for National Development Objectives" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.6">Section 4.2.6</a>, macroeconomic analysis finds that the overall economic implications of carbon pricing differ markedly depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing are used, and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for double dividend if the proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the most distortive taxes in the economy.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and may not be sufficient to address the other objectives pursued. Even if the carbon price is high, the revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are eliminated. For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Jakob--2016">Jakob et al. (2016)</a> find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet a small part of their infrastructure spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak of 0.93% in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric tonne of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span>, to 0.48% in 2018, when the rate had reached USD132 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jonsson--2020">Jonsson et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Statistics%20Sweden--2020">Statistics Sweden 2020</a>). This means that governments that want to avoid a decline in the GDP share for total tax revenues over time would have to raise the intake from other taxes. However, it is here important to note that domestic tax hikes are likely to involve trade-offs since, at the same time as the spending they fund may provide various benefits, they may also reduce the capacity of households and the private sector to consume and invest, something that may reduce growth over time and reduced resources for spending in support of human development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lofgren--2013">Lofgren et al. 2013</a>). It is also worth emphasising that restructuring of the fiscal system amount to changes in the social contract of the society (<a class="reference-link" href="#Combet--2017">Combet and Hourcade 2017</a> and 2014), and thus represents a major economic and social decision.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="4.4.1.9"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.4.1.9</span>Example: Combining Housing Policies With Carbon Taxation Can Deliver Both Housing and Mitigation in the Transport Sector <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-46-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The spatial distribution of households and firms across urban and rural areas is a central characteristic of development pathways.

Notably, choices regarding spatial forms of development have large-scale implications for demand for transportation and associated GHG emissions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Exclusionary mechanisms such as decreasing accessibility and affordability of inner-urban neighbourhoods is a major cause of suburbanisation of low- to middle-income households (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Hochstenbach--2018">Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018</a>). Suburbanisation, in turn, is associated with higher transportation demand (Bento et al. 2005) and higher carbon footprints for households (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones and Kammen 2014</a>).

Said differently, the costs of mitigating intra-city transportation emissions are higher when inner-urban housing prices are higher (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lampin--2013">Lampin et al. 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable can open up broader opportunities for suburban households to relocate in the face of increasing transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and middle-income households, who spend a greater portion of their income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be locked into locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs (e.g., households feeling helpless in front of rising fuel prices) and the economic costs of mitigation policies – as a lower price of carbon is likely to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Making inner-cities neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable is a complex endeavour (<a class="reference-link" href="#Benner,%C2%A0C.%20and%C2%A0A.%20Karner--2016">Benner and Karner 2016</a>). At the same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for a range of social, health and economic reasons. Revenues derived from climate policies could provide additional resources to support such programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use their revenues towards low-income groups (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karner--2018">Karner and Marcantonio 2018</a>). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains out of, or is only emerging in the debates surrounding the planning of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#IADB--2012">IADB 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grant--2015">Grant 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Khosla--2019">Khosla and Bhardwaj 2019</a>).

For low- and middle-income countries, annual costs of reaching these goals by 2030 and putting their economies on a path toward decarbonisation may range between 2% and 8% of GDP, with the level depending on spending efficiency. Notably, these costs need not exceed those of more polluting alternatives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rozenberg--2019">Rozenberg and Fay 2019</a>). For transportation, this involves a shift toward more public transportation (rail and bus), and decarbonised electricity for vehicles, combined with land-use policies that densify cities and reduce distances between homes and jobs. By influencing the spatial distribution of households and firms and the organisation of transportation, infrastructure has a strong bearing on GHG emissions and the costs of providing services to different populations. Depending on country context, the private sector may play a particularly important role in the financing of infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2009">World Bank 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2015">Klein 2015</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Many investments in infrastructure and sectoral capital stocks have long lifetimes.

Today’s investments in electric vehicles in settings where electricity is produced with fossil fuels is an example of convertible investments – they will be decarbonised once electricity production has switched to renewable energies. For capital stocks that cannot be decarbonised, countries may face costs of decommissioning well before the end of their useful lifetimes, especially when it is needed to respect country commitments to future full decarbonisation.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="4.4.1.10"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">4.4.1.10</span>Example: Changing Economic, Social and Spatial Patterns of Development of the Agriculture Sector Provide the Basis for Sustained Reductions in Emissions From Deforestation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-47-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A growing literature assesses co-benefits of sectoral policies that lead to decarbonisation and simultaneously promote economic development, improve living standards, reduce inequality, and create job opportunities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maroun--2012">Maroun and Schaeffer 2012</a>; Bataille et al. 2016b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pye--2016">Pye et al. 2016</a>; Bataille et al. 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#La%20Rovere--2018">La Rovere et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Richter--2018">Richter et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Waisman--2019">Waisman et al. 2019</a>).

Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics may increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate action.

The concept of a ‘just transition’ owes its origin to the USA trade union movement of the 1980s. The earliest version of a just transition was called the ‘Superfund for Workers’ modelled on the 1980 Superfund program that designed federal funds for the clean-up of toxic substances from chemicals, mining and energy production (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stevis--2015">Stevis and Felli 2015</a>).

To cover up for these shortfalls will require taking actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Examples of such actions include shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’, such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the layout of many cities. Because these different actions are connected, it means all relevant companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation (<a class="section-link" data-title="What Is to Be Done to Accelerate Mitigation?" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.5">Section 4.2.5</a>). The deployment of low-emission technology depends upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilise investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political support and understanding), and the provision of relevant enabling conditions (<a class="section-link" data-title href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a>). Encouraging stronger and more ambitious climate action by non-government and sub-national stakeholders, as well as international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) could make significant contributions to emissions reduction (Section 4.2.3).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 4.2 |	What is to be done in the near term to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 4.2 | What is to be done in the near term to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-22-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Increasing speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction faces important obstacles, that are rooted in the underlying structure of societies (<a class="section-link" data-title="Obstacles to Accelerated Mitigation and How Overcoming Them Amounts to Shifts in Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.2.7">Section 4.2.7</a>). Addressing these obstacles amounts to shifting away from existing developmental trends (i.e., shifting development pathways, Cross-Chapter Box 5).

Policies such as progressive taxation, investment in public transport, regulatory transparency, commitment to multilateral environmental governance, fiscal incentives for private investments, international technology development and transfer initiatives, and risk disclosure and efforts to improve underlying enabling conditions (improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change and technological innovation, and provision of finance) address multiple objectives beyond mitigation, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, public health and welfare, providing energy access, providing formal housing, and providing mobility. How we manage our land and agriculture, growing cities, transport needs, our industries, and the way people are trained and employed all impact on GHG emissions and the options we have to reduce them. In turn, reducing GHG emissions can also contribute to reducing poverty, preventing hunger, improving health and wellbeing, and providing clean water and clean energy. Implementing right policies and investments can help to address the challenges of how to reduce emissions without constraining development. For example, in land use, widespread planting of a single tree species or crops for bioenergy (organic matter turned into renewable energy) could affect food and water supplies. Therefore, if bioenergy is to be relied upon to offset emissions, the right policies and investments are needed (see also Chapter 17).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Abadie, L.M., I.

They are based mainly on domestic abatement actions, although countries can use international cooperation to meet their targets. ‘Conditional’ NDCs require international cooperation, for example bilateral agreements under article 6, financing or monetary and/or technological transfers (14.3.2).</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-003"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch04.html#footnote-003-backlink">3</a> </span><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"></span>Note that the statistical metrics reported are slightly different across the reports. For example, IPCC SR1.5 reported the 25th to 75th percentile range while the UNEP Emissions Gap Report uses median and 10th to 90th percentile ranges. In addition, this report applies 100-year GWPs from AR6 to aggregate across different GHG emission species, whereas 100-year GWPs from AR4 were applied in IPCC SR1.5 and <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2020a">UNEP 2020a</a>. The application of AR6 GWPs on average leads to increase of estimates by about 1.3% and ranges are wider due to the difference in statistical error metrics.</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-002"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch04.html#footnote-002-backlink">4</a> </span><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"></span><span lang="en-GB">See Box SPM.1 for a description of the approach to project global warming outcomes of modelled pathways and its consistency with the climate assessm</span><span lang="en-GB">ent in AR6 WGI. </span></p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-001"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch04.html#footnote-001-backlink">5</a> </span><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"></span><span lang="en-GB">The emission gap ranges provided here is calculated as the difference between minimum and maximum emissions estimates of NDCs and the median of the 1.5°C an</span><span lang="en-GB">d 2°C pathways. </span></p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-000"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch04.html#footnote-000-backlink">6</a> </span><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"></span><span lang="en-GB">Specifying gases aids clarity, see Cross-Chapter Boxes 2 and 3 in chapters 2 and 3, respectively.
