In conjunction with other enabling conditions, innovation can support system transitions to limit warming and help shift development pathways. The currently widespread implementation of solar photovoltaic (solar PV) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), for instance, could not have happened without technological innovation (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). Technological innovation can also bring about new and improved ways of delivering services that are essential to human well-being. At the same time as delivering benefits, innovation can result in trade-offs that undermine both progress on mitigation and progress towards other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Trade-offs include negative externalities – for instance, greater environmental pollution and social inequalities – rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased dependency on foreign knowledge and providers (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). Effective governance and policy has the potential to avoid and minimise such misalignments (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement </span>). <!-- -->{16.1, &lt;span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5.1, 16.6}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">A systemic view of innovation to direct and organise the processes has grown over the last decade.

This, in turn, has enabled the analysis and strengthening of innovation systems. Traditional quantitative innovation indicators mainly include research and development (R&amp;D) investments and patents. Systemic indicators of innovation, however, go well beyond these approaches. They include structural innovation system elements including actors and networks, as well as indicators for how innovation systems function, such as access to finance, employment in relevant sectors, and lobbying activities. For example, in Latin America, monitoring systemic innovation indicators for the effectiveness of agroecological mitigation approaches has provided insights on the appropriateness and social alignment of new technologies and practices. Climate-energy-economy models, including integrated assessment models, generally employ a stylised and necessarily incomplete view of innovation, and have yet to incorporate a systemic representation of innovation systems. <!-- -->{16.2, 16.2.4, 16.3, 16.3.4, 16.5, Table 16.7, Box 16.1, Box 16.3, Box 16.10}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">A systemic perspective on technological change can provide insights to policymakers supporting their selection of effective innovation policy instruments (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>A combination of scaled-up innovation investments with demand-pull interventions can achieve faster technology unit cost reductions and more rapid scale-up <span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-"></span> than either approach in isolation (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). <span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-"></span>These innovation policy instruments would nonetheless have to be tailored to local development priorities, to the specific context of different countries, and to the technology being supported. The timing of interventions and any trade-offs with sustainable development also need to be addressed. <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"></span>Public R&amp;D funding and support, as well as innovation procurement, have proven valuable for fostering innovation in small to medium cleantech firms. Innovation outcomes of policy instruments not necessarily aimed at innovation, such as feed-in tariffs, auctions, emissions trading schemes, taxes and renewable portfolio standards, vary from negligible to positive for climate change mitigation. Some specific designs of environmental taxation can also result in negative distributional outcomes. Most of the available literature and evidence on innovation systems come from industrialised countries and larger developing countries.

For instance, innovation cooperation on wind energy has contributed to the accelerated global spread of this technology. As another example, the policy guidance by the Indian government, which also promoted development of data, testing capabilities and knowledge within the private sector, has been a key determinant of the success of an energy-efficiency programme for air conditioners and refrigerators in India. <!-- -->{16.3, &lt;span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;16.5, 16.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter, Box 16.2}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Consistent with innovation system approaches, the sharing of knowledge and experiences between developed and developing countries can contribute to addressing global climate and SDGs.

This enhances the continued need for capacity building. Ideas to improve the alignment of the global IPR regime and address climate change include specific arrangements for least-developed countries, case-by-case decision-making and patent-pooling institutions. <!-- -->{16.2.3.3, 16.5, Box 16.9}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Although some initiatives</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">have mobilised investments in developing countries, gaps in innovation cooperation remain, including in the Paris Agreement instruments.

Studies also highlight the potential for cultural factors to strongly influence the pace and direction of technological change. Sustainable solutions require adoption and mainstreaming of locally novel technologies that can meet local needs, and simultaneously address the SDGs. Acknowledging the systemic nature of technological innovation, which involves many levels of actors, stages of innovation and scales, can lead to new opportunities to shift development pathways towards sustainability. <!-- -->{16.4, 16.5, 16.6}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">An area where sustainable development, climate change mitigation and technological change interact is digitalisation.

The absence of adequate governance in many countries can lead to harsh working conditions and unregulated disposal of electronic waste. Digitalisation also affects firms’ competitiveness, the demand for skills, and the distribution of, and access to, resources. The existing digital divide, especially in developing countries, and the lack of appropriate governance of the digital revolution can hamper the role that digitalisation could play in supporting the achievement of stringent mitigation targets. At present, the understanding of both the direct and indirect impacts of digitalisation on energy use, carbon emissions and potential mitigation, is limited (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>). <!-- -->{Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter, 16.2}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Strategies for climate change mitigation can be most effective in accelerating transformative change when actions taken to strengthen one set of enabling conditions also reinforce and strengthen the effectiveness of other enabling conditions (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">medium confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>Applying transition or system dynamics to decisions can help policymakers take advantage of such high-leverage intervention points, address the specific characteristics of technological stages, and respond to societal dynamics.

A central element is that national systems of innovation can help achieve both climate change goals and SDGs, by integrating new ideas, devices, resources, new and traditional knowledge, and technological changes for more effective and adaptive solutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lundvall--1992">Lundvall 1992</a>). At the organisational level, innovation is seen as a process that can bring value by means of creating more effective products, services, processes, technologies, policies and business models that are applicable to commercial, business, financial and even societal or political organisations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brooks--1980">Brooks 1980</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arthur--2009">Arthur 2009</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The literature refers to the terms ‘technology push‘, ‘market pull‘, ‘regulatory push-pull‘, and ‘firm specific factors‘ as drivers for innovation, mostly to inform policymakers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zubeltzu-Jaka--2018">Zubeltzu-Jaka et al. 2018</a>).

Policy and social factors and the diverse trajectories of innovation are influenced by regional and national conditions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tariq--2017">Tariq et al. 2017</a>), and such local needs and purposes need to be considered in crafting international policies aimed at fostering the global transition towards increased sustainability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caravella--2020">Caravella and Crespi 2020</a>).

Market forces do not provide sufficient incentives for investment in development or diffusion of technologies, leaving a role for public policy to create the conditions to assure a systemic innovation approach (<a class="reference-link" href="#Popp--2010">Popp 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Popp--2012">Popp and Newell 2012</a>).

Each of these phases differs with respect to the kind of activity carried out, the type of actors involved and their roles, financing needs, and the associated risks and uncertainties.

by creating a combination of artefacts to perform a particular function, or to achieve a specific goal. R&amp;D activities comprise basic research, applied research and technology development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge, primarily directed towards a specific, practical aim or objective (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2015a">OECD 2015a</a>). Importantly, R&amp;D activities can be incremental – that is, focused on addressing a specific need by marginally improving an existing technology – or radical, representing a paradigm shift, promoted by new opportunities arising with the accumulation of new knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mendon%C3%A7a--2018">Mendonça et al. 2018</a>).

Over time, more classifications of TRLs have been introduced, notably the one used by the European Union (EU). Most recently, the International Energy Agency (IEA) extended previous classifications to include the later stages of the innovation process (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020b">IEA 2020b</a>) and applied it to compare the market readiness of clean energy technologies and their components (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2015a">OECD 2015a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020b">IEA 2020b</a>). TRLs are currently widely used by engineers, business people, research funders and investors, often to assess the readiness of whole technologies rather than single components. To determine a TRL for a given technology, a technology readiness assessment (TRA) is carried out to examine programme concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities. In the most recent version of the IEA (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020b">IEA 2020b</a>), TRLs range from 1 to 11, with 11 indicating the most mature (Table 16.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The purpose of TRLs is to support decision-making.

On the other hand, incentives to invest in R&amp;D depend on the future cost of manufacturing, which in turn depends on the scale of learning by doing.

Digitalisation is expected to be a fast process, but this transformation takes place against entrenched individual behaviours, existing infrastructure, the legacy of time frames, vested interest and slow institutional processes, and requires trust from consumers, producers and institutions. A core question relates to who controls and manages data created by everyday operations (calls, shopping, weather data, service use, and so on). Regulations that limit or ban the expropriation and exploitation of behavioural data, sourced via smartphones, represent crucial aspects in digitalisation pathways, alongside the possibility to create climate movements and political pressure from the civil society. Governance mechanisms need to be developed to ensure that digital technologies such as AI take over ethical choices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Craglia--2018">Craglia et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rahwan--2019">Rahwan et al. 2019</a>). Appropriate governance is necessary for digitalisation to effectively work in tandem with established mitigation technologies and choice architectures. Consideration of system-wide effects and overall management is essential to avoid runaway effects. Overall governance of digitalisation remains a challenge, and will have large-scale repercussions on energy demand and GHG emissions.</p><div class="h3-container" id="16.2.2.4"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">16.2.2.4</span>Explaining Past and Projecting Future Technology Cost Changes <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-8-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Researchers and policymakers alike are interested in using observed empirical patterns of learning to project future reductions in costs of technologies.

Scenarios emerging from cost-optimal climate-energy-economy models are too pessimistic, especially in the case of rapidly changing technologies such as wind and batteries in the past decade. Conversely, they tend to be too optimistic regarding the timing of action, or the availability of a given technology and its speed of diffusion (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shiraki--2020">Shiraki and Sugiyama 2020</a>). Furthermore, some technological and economic transformations may emerge as technically feasible from IAMs, but are not realistic if taking into account political economy, international politics, human behaviours, and cultural factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bosetti--2021">Bosetti 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There is a range of projected energy technology supply costs included in the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report <span class="•-Condensed-italic"></span> (AR6) Scenario Database (Box 16.1).

Several sources of current solar PV costs report values that are at the low end of the AR6 Scenario Database.

More stringent targets (2°C) are achieved through a higher deployment of renewable technologies: by 2050 solar (wind) capacity is estimated to increase by a factor of 15 (10) (Box 16.1, Figure 1c). This is accompanied by an almost complete phase-out of coal (–87%). The percentage of median changes in installed capacity in scenarios that limit warming to 3°C (&gt;50%) and in scenarios that limit warming to 4°C (&gt;50%)is within comparable ranges of that observed in the last decade.

A key point of MLP is that new technologies need to establish themselves in a stable ‘socio-technical regime’ and are therefore generally at a disadvantage, not just because of their low technological maturity, but also because of an unwelcoming system. The MLP highlights that the uptake of technologies in society is an evolutionary process, which can be best understood as a combination of ‘variation, selection and retention’ as well as ‘unfolding and reconfiguration’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2002">Geels 2002</a>). Thus, new technologies in their early stages need to be selected and supported at the micro-level by niche markets, possibly through a directed process that has been termed ‘strategic niche management’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kemp--1998">Kemp et al. 1998</a>). As, at the landscape level, pressures on incumbent regimes mount, and those regimes destabilise, the niche technologies get a chance to get established in a new socio-technical regime. This allows these technologies to grow and stabilise, shaping a changed or sometimes radically renewed socio-technical regime. The MLP takes a systematic and comprehensive view about how to nurture and shape technological transitions by understanding them as evolutionary, multidirectional and cumulative socio-technical processes playing out at multiple levels over time, with a concomitant expansion in the scale and scope of the transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Elzen--2004">Elzen et al. 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2005">Geels 2005</a>).

The more recent understanding of, and shift of focus to, the systemic nature on the innovation and diffusion of technologies has implications for innovation policy, since innovation outcomes depend not just on inputs such as R&amp;D, but much more on the functioning of the overall innovation system (see Sections 16.3.1 and 16.4). Policies can therefore be directed at innovation systems components and processes that need the greatest attention or support. This may include, for example, strengthening the capabilities of weak actors and improving interactions between actors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jacobsson--2017">Jacobsson et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Weber--2017">Weber and Truffer 2017</a>).

lang="en-GB">Energy efficiency is often characterised as a ‘low-hanging fruit’ for reducing energy use. However, systemic failures such as lack of access to capital, hidden costs of implementation, and imperfect information can result in low investments into adoption and innovation in energy efficiency measures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sorrell--2004">Sorrell et al. 2004</a>). To address such barriers, India’s governmental Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) introduced the Standards and Labelling (S&amp;L) programme to promote innovation in energy efficient appliances in 2006 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sundaramoorthy--2017">Sundaramoorthy and Walia 2017</a>). While context-dependent, the programme’s design, policies and scale-up contain lessons for addressing systemic failures elsewhere too.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Programme design and addressing of early sy</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">stemic barriers</span></p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">To design the S&amp;L programme, BEE drew on the international experiences and technical expertise of the Collaborative Labelling and Appliance Standards Program (CLASP) – a non-profit organisation that provides technical and policy support to governments in implementing S&amp;L programmes. For example, since there was no data on the efficiency of appliances in the Indian market, CLASP assisted with early data collection efforts, resulting in a focus on refrigerators and air conditioners (<a class="reference-link" href="#McNeil--2008">McNeil et al. 2008</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Besides drawing from international knowledge, the involvement of manufacturers, testing laboratories, and customers was crucial for the functioning of the innovation system.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">To involve manufacturers, BEE employed three strategies to set the standards at an ambitious yet acceptable level. First, BEE enlisted the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi (a public technical university) to engage with manufacturers and to demonstrate cost-effective designs of energy-efficient appliances. Second, BEE agreed to make the standards voluntary from 2006 to 2010. In return, the manufacturers agreed to mandatory and progressively more stringent standards starting in 2010. Third, BEE established a multistakeholder committee with representation from BEE, the Bureau of Indian Standards, appliance manufacturers, test laboratories, independent experts, and consumer groups (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jairaj--2016">Jairaj et al. 2016</a>) to ensure that adequately stringent standards are negotiated every two years.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">At this time, India had virtually no capacity for independent testing of appliances. Here, too, BEE used multiple approaches towards creating the actors and resources needed for the innovation system to function. First, BEE funded the Central Power Research Institute (CPRI) – a national laboratory for applied research, testing and certification of electrical equipment – to set up refrigerator and AC testing facilities. Second, they invited bids from private laboratories, thus creating a demand for testing facilities. Third, BEE developed testing protocols in partnership with universities. Australian standards for testing frost-free refrigerators were adopted until local standards were developed. Thus, once the testing laboratories, protocols and benchmark prices for testing were in place, the appliance manufacturers could employ their services.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Finally, a customer outreach programme was conducted from 2006 to 2008 to inform customers about energy-efficient appliances, to enable them to interpret the labels correctly, and to understand their purchase decisions and information sources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jain--2018">Jain et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Joshi--2019">Joshi et al. 2019</a>). BEE initiated a capacity-building programme for retailers to be an information source for customers. A comprehensive document with details of different models and labels was provided to retailers, together with a condensed booklet to be shared with customers.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Adapting policies to technologies an</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">d local context </span></p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">While many of India’s standards and testing protocols were based on international standards, they needed to be adapted to the Indian context. For example, because of higher temperatures in India, the reference outside temperature of 32°C for refrigerators was changed to 36°C.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">AC testing protocols also had to be adapted because of the emergence of inverter-based ACs. Existing testing done only at a single temperature did not value inverter-based ACs’ better average performance as compared to fixed-speed ACs over a range of temperatures. Thus, the Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) was developed for Indian temperature conditions in 2015 by studying International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and through consultations with manufacturers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mukherjee--2020">Mukherjee et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">These measures had multiple effects on technological change. As a result of stringent standards, India has some of the most efficient refrigerators globally. In the case of ACs, the ISEER accelerated technological change by favouring inverter-based ACs over fixed-speed ACs, driving down their costs and increasing their market shares (<a class="reference-link" href="#BEE--2020">BEE 2020</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Scaling up policies for market </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">transformation</span></p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">As the S&amp;L programme was expanded, BEE took measures to standardise, codify and automate it. For example, to process a high volume of applications for labels efficiently, an online application portal with objective and transparent certification criteria was created. This gave certainty to the manufacturers, enabling diversity and faster diffusion of energy-efficient appliances. Thus by 2019, the programme expanded to cover thousands of products across 23 appliance types (<a class="reference-link" href="#BEE--2020">BEE 2020</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Besides issuing labels, the enforcement of standards also needed to be scaled up efficiently. BEE developed protocols for randomly sampling appliances for testing. Manufacturers were given a fixed period to rectify products that did not meet the standards, failing which they would be penalised and the test results would be made public.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="Box 16.3 | Investments in Public Energy"><h2 class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Box 16.3 | Investments in Public Energy Research and Development</span><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"></span></span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-9-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Public energy R&amp;D investments are a crucial driver of energy technology innovation (Sections 16.2.1.1 and 16.4.1).

Such data on other countries, in particular developing countries, are not available, although recent evidence suggests that expenditures are increasing there (IEA 2020c). The IEA collected partial data from China and India in the context of Mission Innovation, but this is only available starting from 2014 and thus not included in Figure 1.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">The figure illustrates two points. First, energy-related RD&amp;D has risen slowly in the last 20 years, and is now reaching levels comparable with the peak of energy RD&amp;D investments following the two oil crises. Second, over time there has been a reorientation of the portfolio of funded energy technologies away from nuclear energy. In 2019, around 80% of all public energy RD&amp;D spending was on low-emission technologies – energy efficiency, carbon dioxide capture, use and storage, renewables, nuclear, hydrogen, energy storage and cross-cutting issues such as smart grids. A more detailed discussion of the time profile of RD&amp;D spending in IEA countries, including as a share of GDP, is available in IEA (2020b).</p><div id="_idContainer013" class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body"><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-continued-overleaf--subhead-" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" id="figure-box-16-14-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Box_16_3_Figure_1.png"></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Box 16.3, Figure 1 | Fraction of public energy RD&amp;D spending by technology over time for IEA (largely OECD) countries between 1974 and 2018.</span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"> </span>Sources: RD&amp;D Database (2019), IEA (2019) (extracted on November 11, 2020).</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.3.3"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">16.3.3</span>Indicators for Technological Innovation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-10-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Assessing the state of technological innovation helps in understanding the progress of current efforts and policies in meeting stated objectives, and how we might design policies to do better.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Traditionally, input measures such as research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments, and output measures such as scientific publication and patents were used to characterise innovation activities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freeman--2009">Freeman and Soete 2009</a>). This is partly because of the successes of specialised R&amp;D efforts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freeman--1995">Freeman 1995</a>), the predominant linear model of innovation, and because such measures can (relatively) easily be obtained and compared. In the realm of energy-related innovation, RD&amp;D investments remain the single most-used indicator to measure inputs into the innovation process (Box 16.3). Patent counts are a widely used indicator of the outputs of the innovation process, especially because they are detailed enough to provide information on specific adaptation and mitigation technologies. Mitigation and adaptation technologies have their own classification (Y02) with the European Patent Office (EPO) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Veefkind--2012">Veefkind et al. 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Angelucci--2018">Angelucci et al. 2018</a>), which can be complemented with keyword search and manual inspection (<a class="reference-link" href="#Persoon--2020">Persoon et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Surana--2020b">Surana et al. 2020b</a>). However, using energy-related patents as an indicator of innovative activities is complicated by several issues (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Rassenfosse--2013">de Rassenfosse et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ha%C5%A1%C4%8Di%C4%8D--2015">Haščič and Migotto 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jaffe--2017">Jaffe and de Rassenfosse 2017</a>), including the fact that the scope of what are considered climate mitigation inventions is not always clear or straightforward.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Conversely, private energy R&amp;D investments and investments by financing firms cannot be precisely assessed for a number of reasons, including limited reporting and the difficulty of singling out energy-related investments. This inability to precisely quantify private investments in energy R&amp;D leads to a patchy understanding of the energy innovation system, and how private energy R&amp;D investments responds to public energy R&amp;D investments. Overall, evidence shows that some of the industrial sectors that are important for meeting climate goals (electricity, agriculture and forestry, mining, oil and gas, and other energy-intensive industrial sectors) are investing relatively small fractions of sales on R&amp;D (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement </span>) (Jasmab and Pollitt 2005; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jamasb--2008">Jamasb and Pollitt 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sanyal--2009">Sanyal and Cohen 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#European%20Commission--2015">European Commission 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#American%20Energy%20Innovation%20Council--2017">American Energy Innovation Council 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gaddy--2017">Gaddy et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#National%20Science%20Board--2018">National Science Board 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Financing firms also play an important role in the energy innovation process, but data availability is limited. The venture capital (VC) financing model, used to overcome the ‘valley of death’ in the biotech and IT space (<a class="reference-link" href="#Frank--1996">Frank et al. 1996</a>), has not been as suitable for hardware start-ups in the energy space: for example, the percentage of exit outcomes in cleantech start-ups was almost half of that in medical start-ups, and less than a third of software investments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gaddy--2017">Gaddy et al. 2017</a>). The current VC model and other private finance do not sufficiently cover the need to demonstrate energy technologies at scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Anad%C3%B3n--2012">Anadón 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mazzucato--2013">Mazzucato 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nemet--2018">Nemet et al. 2018</a>). This greater difficulty in reaching the market compared to other sectors may have contributed to a reduction in private equity and venture capital finance for renewable energy technologies after the boom of the late 2000s (<a class="reference-link" href="#Frankfurt%20School-UNEP%20Centre/BNEF--2019">Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre/BNEF 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Quantitative indicators such as energy-related RD&amp;D spending are insufficient for the assessment of innovation systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#David--1995">David and Foray 1995</a>): they only provide a partial view into innovation activities, and one that is potentially misleading (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freeman--2009">Freeman and Soete 2009</a>). Qualitative indicators measuring the more intangible aspects of the innovation process and system are crucial to fully understand the innovation dynamics in a climate or energy technologies or sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gallagher--2006">Gallagher et al. 2006</a>), including in relation to adopting an adaptive learning strategy and supporting learning through demonstration projects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2017">Chan et al. 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In Table 16.7, both quantitative and qualitative indicators for systemic innovation are outlined, using clean energy innovation as an illustrative example, and drawing on a broad literature base, taking into account both the input-output-outcome classification and its variations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freeman--1997">Freeman and Soete 1997</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sagar--2002">Sagar and Holdren 2002</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hu--2018">Hu et al. 2018</a>), combined with the functions of technological innovation systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Miremadi--2018">Miremadi et al. 2018</a>), while also being cognisant of the specific role of key actors and institutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gallagher--2012">Gallagher et al. 2012</a>). A specific assessment of innovation may focus on part of such a list of indicators, depending on what aspect of innovation is being studied, whether the analysis takes a more or less systemic perspective, and the specific technology and geography considered. Similarly, innovation policies may be designed to specifically boost only some of these aspects, depending on whether a given country/region is committed to strengthen a given technology or phase.</p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table 16.7 | Commonly used quantitative innovation metrics, organised by inputs, outputs and outcomes. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> Sources: based on <a class="reference-link" href="#Sagar--2002">Sagar and Holdren (2002)</a>; Gallagher et al.

Since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), PV has become a substantial global industry – a truly disruptive technology that has generated trade disputes among superpowers, threatened the solvency of large energy companies, and prompted reconsideration of electric utility regulation rooted in the 1930s. More favourably, its continually falling costs and rapid adoption are improving air quality and facilitating climate change mitigation. PV is now so inexpensive that it is important in an expanding set of countries.

Solar followed an overlapping but sequential process of technology creation, market creation and cost reduction (comparable to emergence, early adoption, diffusion and stabilisation in Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter). In the technology creation phase, examples of central processes include flows of knowledge from one person to another, between firms, and between countries as well as US and Japanese R&amp;D funding in the 1970s and early 1980s. During market creation, PVs modular scale allowed it to serve a variety of niche markets from satellites in the 1950s to toys in the 1980s, when Germany transformed the industry from niche to mass market with its subsidy programme that began in 2000 and became important for PV in 2004. The dramatic increase in size combined with its 20-year guaranteed contracts reduced risk for investors and created confidence in PV’s long-term growth. Supportive policies also emerged outside Germany, in Spain, Italy, California, and China, which spread the risk, even as national policy support was more volatile. Rapid and deep cost reductions were made possible by: learning by doing in the process of operating, optimising, and combining production equipment; investing and improving each manufacturing line to gradually scale up to massive sizes; and incremental improvements in the PV devices themselves.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Central to PV development has been its modularity, which provided two distinct advantages: access to niche markets, and iterative improvement. Solar has been deployed as a commercial technology across nine orders of magnitude: from a 1W cell in a calculator to a 1GW plant in the Egyptian desert, and almost every scale in between. This modular scale enabled PV to serve a sequence of policy-independent niche markets (such as satellites and telecoms applications), which generally increased in size and decreased in willingness to pay, in line with the technology cost reductions. This modular scale also enabled a large number of iterations, such that in 2020 over three billion solar panels had been produced. Compared to, for instance, approximately 1000 nuclear reactors that were ever constructed, a million times more opportunities for learning by doing were available to solar PV: to make incremental improvements, to introduce new manufacturing equipment, to optimise that equipment, and to learn from failures. More generally, recent work has pointed to the benefits of modularity in the speed of adoption (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2020">Wilson et al. 2020</a>) and learning rates (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sweerts--2020">Sweerts et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">While many technologies do not fit into the solar model, some – including micro nuclear reactors and direct air capture – also have modular characteristics that make them suitable for following solar’s path and benefit from solar’s drivers. However, it took solar PV 60 years to become cheap, which is too slow for addressing climate change if a technology is now still at the lab scale. A challenge in learning from the solar model is therefore how to use public policy to speed up innovation over much shorter time frames, for example, 15 or fewer years.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-continued-overleaf--subhead-" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" id="figure-box-16-14-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Box_16_4_Figure_1.png"></p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Box 16.4, Figure 1 | Milestones in the development of low-cost solar photovoltaics. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> Source <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">: </span><a class="reference-link" href="#Nemet--2019">Nemet (2019)</a>.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="16.4"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">16.4</span>Innovation Policies and Institutions </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-5-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Building on the frameworks for identifying market failures (<a class="section-link" data-title="Elements, Drivers and Modelling of Technology Innovation" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.2">Section 16.2</a>) and systemic failures (<a class="section-link" data-title="A Systemic View of Technological Innovation Processes" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.3">Section 16.3</a>) in the innovation system for climate-related technologies, <a class="section-link" data-title="Innovation Policies and Institutions" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.4">Section 16.4</a> proceeds as follows.

The economic policy instruments that can be classified as market pull instruments when it comes to the competitiveness outcome (at least in the short term) is more mixed.

Its main goal is to acquire products or services to improve public services, infrastructures and facilities and, in some cases, to also incentivise innovation. It is important to implement several steps in the public procurement procedure to improve transparency, minimise waste, fraud and corruption of public fund. These steps range from the assessment of a need, issuance of a tender, to the monitoring of delivery of the good or service. Box 16.5 outlines a public procurement programme that was implemented in The Netherlands in 2005 with a focus on green technologies. In spite of the fact that green procurement policies have been implemented, the literature assessing the innovation impact of public procurement programmes is relatively limited, and suggests either a positive impact or no impact (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alvarez--2015">Alvarez and Rubio 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Baron--2016">Baron 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fern%C3%A1ndez-Sastre--2019">Fernández-Sastre and Montalvo-Quizhpi 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pe%C3%B1asco--2021">Peñasco et al. 2021</a>).

This approach can be exemplified by a relatively new energy R&amp;D funding agency in the USA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E). This agency was created in 2009 and it was modelled on the experience of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – a US government agency funding high-risk, high-reward research in defence-related areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bonvillian--2011">Bonvillian and Van Atta 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#US%20National%20Academies%20of%20Sciences%20Engineering%20and%20Medicine--2017">US National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bonvillian--2018">Bonvillian 2018</a>). DARPA programme managers had a lot of discretion for making decisions about funding projects, but since energy R&amp;D funding is usually more politically vulnerable than defence R&amp;D funding, the ARPA-E model involved programme managers requesting external review as an informational input (<a class="reference-link" href="#Azoulay--2019">Azoulay et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">As for DARPA, ARPA-E programme managers use an active management approach that involves empowering programme manages to make decisions about funding allocation, milestones and goals. ARPA-E managers also differ from other R&amp;D allocation mechanisms in that ARPA-E staff retain some control on the funded projects after the allocation of funds. As argued by <a class="reference-link" href="#Azoulay--2019">Azoulay et al. (2019)</a>, even though this relative control over the project can result in a reduction in the flexibility of funded researchers, some ‘exploration’ happens at the programme manager level.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Research on ARPA-E also sheds light on the process of project selection, or how programme managers decide what projects to fund. Programme managers do not just follow the rankings of peer reviewers (sometimes projects with very disparate rankings were funded) and in many cases programme managers reported using information from review comments instead of the rankings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Goldstein--2020">Goldstein and Kearney 2020</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Azoulay--2019">Azoulay et al.

There has been a significant degree of harmonisation and cooperation between national IP systems over time. The most recent milestone is the World Trade Organization (WTO) 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, entered into by all WTO members, which sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of IP as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations (<a class="reference-link" href="#WTO--1994">WTO 1994</a>). Developing countries successfully managed to include some flexibilities into TRIPS, both in terms of timing of legislative reform, and the content of the reforms. In an attempt to understand the effects of the introduction of TRIPS, <a class="reference-link" href="#Falvey--2006">Falvey et al. (2006)</a> find that the effect of IP protection on growth is positively and significantly related to growth for low- and high-income countries, but not for middle-income countries. They argue that low-income countries benefit from increased technology flows, but middle-income countries may have offsetting losses from the reduced scope for imitation. Note that <a class="reference-link" href="#Falvey--2006">Falvey et al. (2006)</a> do not break down their results in different technological areas, and they do not focus on innovation, but instead on growth. It has been argued that the increasingly globalised IP regime through initiatives such as the TRIPS agreement will diminish prospects for technology transfer and competition in developing countries, particularly for several important technology areas related to meeting sustainable development needs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maskus--2017">Maskus and Reichman 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In principle, patent holders are not required to take their protected invention into use, and neither have the obligation to allow (i.e., license) others to use the inventions in question (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement </span>). Studies have shown that the way patent holders use their patent differs considerably across industrial sectors: in pharmaceutics, patents are typically used to enable exclusive production of a certain good (and obtain monopoly rents), while in industries such as computers, semiconductors, and communications, patents are often used to strengthen positions in cross-licensing negotiations and to generate licensing income (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cohen--2000">Cohen et al. 2000</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Foray--2004">Foray 2004</a>). There are also companies that predominantly obtain patents for defensive reasons: they seek freedom to design and manufacture, and by owning a patent portfolio themselves, they hope to prevent becoming the target of litigation by other patent holders (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2001">Hall and Ziedonis 2001</a>). Patents are often used strategically to impede the development and diffusion of competing, alternative products, processes or services, by employing strategies known as ‘blanketing’ and ‘fencing’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grandstrand--2000">Grandstrand 2000</a>), although the research is not specific to the climate space.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There are notable but specific exceptions to the general principle that patent holders are not obliged to license their patent to others.

First, most national patent laws have provisions for compulsory licensing, meaning that a government allows someone else to produce a patented product or process without the consent of the patent holder, or plans to use the patent-protected invention itself (<a class="reference-link" href="#WTO--2020">WTO 2020</a>). Compulsory licences may be issued in cases of public interest or events of abuse of the patent (<a class="reference-link" href="#WIPO--2008">WIPO 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Biadgleng--2009">Biadgleng 2009</a>). Compulsory licensing is explicitly allowed in the WTO TRIPS agreement, and its use in context of medicine (for instance, to control diseases of public health importance, including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria) is further clarified in the ‘DOHA Declaration’ from 2001 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Reichman--2009">Reichman 2009</a>; WHO 2020). Second, standard-setting organisations have policies to include patented inventions in their standards only if the patent holder is willing to commit FRAND licensing conditions for those patents (<a class="reference-link" href="#Contreras--2015">Contreras 2015</a>). While a patent holder can choose not to make such a commitment, by doing so, its patent is no longer a candidate for inclusion in the standard. In the (many) fields where standards are of key importance, it is very unusual for patent holders not to be willing to enter into FRAND commitments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bekkers--2017">Bekkers 2017</a>). Third, when a patent holder files at the patent office and opts for the ‘licence of right’ regime, in return for reduced patent fees, they enter into a contractual agreement that obliges them to license the patent to those who request it. While not all national patent systems feature this regime, it is a feature present in the new European Community patent (<a class="reference-link" href="#EPO--2017">EPO 2017</a>), and may therefore increase in importance.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">For a discussion on the impact of intellectual property rights (IPR) on international technology diffusion, see Box 16.9 in <a class="section-link" data-title="International Technology Transfer and Cooperation for Transformative Change" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.5">Section 16.5</a>.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.4.7"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">16.4.7</span> Sub-national Innovation Policies and Industrial Clusters <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-20-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Research examining the impacts of sub-national policies on innovation and competitiveness is sporadic – regional variations have been quantitatively assessed in the USA or China, or with case studies in these and other countries.

This stage is often the most visible and turbulent, because more widespread adoption of a new technology gives rise to structural changes in institutions and actors’ behaviour (e.g., increased adoption of smartphones to new payment systems and social media), and because when incumbent market actors become threatened, they often contest policies promoting the new technologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#K%C3%B6hler--2019">Köhler et al. 2019</a>).

These factors and policies are context specific. For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2019">Patt et al.

This is particularly the case during early adoption, where economic barriers predominate; during diffusion, policies that address regime-level factors often need to deal with cross-sectoral linkages and coupling, such as those between power generation, transportation, and heating (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2015">Patt 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bloess--2019">Bloess 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fridgen--2020">Fridgen et al. 2020</a>). The entire cycle can take multiple decades. However, later stages can go faster by building on the earlier stages that have taken place elsewhere. For example, early RD&amp;D into wind energy took place primarily in Denmark, was followed by early adoption in Denmark, Germany, and Spain, before other countries, including the USA, India, and China, leapfrogged directly to the diffusion stage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chaudhary--2015">Chaudhary et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dai--2015">Dai and Xue 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lacal-Ar%C3%A1ntegui--2019">Lacal-Arántegui 2019</a>).

Declining costs in solar and wind cause new investment in the power-generation sector being dominated by those technologies, leading to increased political support and further cost reductions (Chapter 6). In buildings (Chapter 9) and personal mobility (Chapter 10), low-carbon heating systems and electric vehicles are gaining public acceptance, leading to improved infrastructure and human resources, more employment in those sectors, and behavioural contagion.

For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Mercure--2018">Mercure et al.

Social innovation can contribute to maximising synergies and minimising trade-offs in relation to technological and other innovative practices, but for this to materialise, national, regional and local circumstances need to be taken into account and, if needed, changed.

These potentials will depend on available resources, geographical conditions, development stage and policy measures.

For technology innovation to be effective in enhancing synergies and reducing trade-offs, its role and nature in production and consumption patterns, as well as in value chains and in the wider economy, requires clarification.

However, innovation and even fast technological change will not be enough to achieve Paris Agreement mitigation objectives. Other changes are necessary across the production and consumption system and the society in general, including behavioural changes.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Technological changes never happen in a vacuum; they are always accompanied by, for instance, people changing habits, companies changing value chains, or banks changing risk profiles. Therefore, technological changes driven by holistic approaches can contribute to accelerate and spread those changes towards the achievement of climate and sustainable development goals.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">In innovation studies, such systemic approaches are said to strengthen the functions of technological or national innovation systems, so that climate-friendly technologies can flourish. Innovation policies can help respond to local priorities and prevent unintended and undesirable consequences of technological change, such as unequal access to new technologies across countries and between income groups, environmental degradation and negative effects on employment.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.2 | 	What can be done to promote innovation for climate change and the widespread diffusion of low-emission and climate-resilient technology?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 16.2 | What can be done to promote innovation for climate change and the widespread diffusion of low-emission and climate-resilient technology?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-41-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The speed and success of innovation processes could be enhanced with the involvement of a wider range of actors from the industry, research and financial communities working in partnerships at national, regional and international levels. Public policies play a critical role to bring together these different actors and create the necessary enabling conditions, including financial support, through different instruments as well as institutional and human capacities.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The increasing complexity of technologies requires cooperation if their widespread diffusion is to be achieved. Cooperation includes the necessary knowledge flow within and between countries and regions.

Innovation capabilities are required not only to adapt new technologies for local use, but also to create new markets and business models. International technology cooperation can serve that purpose.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">In fact, evidence shows that international cooperation on technology development and transfer can help developing countries to achieve their climate goals more effectively and, if this is done properly, can also help to addressing other sustainable development goals. Many initiatives exist both regionally and globally to help countries in achieving technology development and transfer through partnerships and research collaboration that include developed and developing countries, with a key role for technological institutions and universities. Enhancing current activities would help an effective, long-term global response to climate change, while promoting sustainable development.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Globalisation of production and supply of goods and services, including innovation and new technologies, may open up opportunities for developing countries to advance technology diffusion; however, so far not all countries have benefitted from the globalisation of innovation due to different barriers, such as access to finance and technical capabilities. These asymmetries between countries in the globalisation process can also lead to dependencies on foreign knowledge and providers.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Not all technology cooperation directly results in mitigation outcomes. Overall, technology transfer broadly has focused on enhancing climate technology absorption and deployment in developing countries as well as research, development and demonstration, and knowledge spillovers.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The Paris Agreement also reflects this view by noting that countries shall strengthen cooperative action on technology development and transfer regarding two main aspects: (i) promoting collaborative approaches to research and development; and (ii) facilitating access to technology to developing country Parties.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-10-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Abbott--2018" lang="en-GB">Abbott, F.M., 2018: Intellectual Property Rights and Climate Change: Interpreting the TRIPS Agreement for Environmentally Sound Technologies.
