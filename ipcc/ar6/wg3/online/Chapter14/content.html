Moreover, its processes and commitments will enhance countries’ abilities to achieve their stated level of ambition, particularly among developing countries (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>). Arguments against the Paris Agreement are that it lacks a mechanism to review the adequacy of individual Parties’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that collectively current NDCs are inconsistent in their level of ambition with achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal, that its processes will not lead to sufficiently rising levels of ambition in the NDCs, and that NDCs will not be achieved because the targets, policies and measures they contain are not legally binding at the international level (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>).

Such cooperation includes multilateral global cooperative agreements among nation states such as the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and its related legal instruments, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, but also plurilateral agreements involving fewer states, as well as those focused on particular economic and policy sectors, such as components of the energy system. Moreover, this chapter assesses the role of transnational agreements and cooperative arrangements between non-state and sub-national actors, including municipal governments, private sector firms and industry consortia, and civil society organisations. This chapter does not assess international cooperation within the European Union, as this is covered in <a class="section-link" data-title="National and sub-national policies and institutions" href="/chapters/chapter-13">Chapter 13</a> of this report.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Past IPCC assessment reports have discussed the theoretical literature, providing insights into the rationale for international cooperation, as well as guidance as to its structure and implementation. This chapter limits such theoretical discussion primarily to the new developments since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Important developments in this respect include attention to climate clubs (groups of countries and potentially non-state actors that can work together to achieve particular objectives), and the effects of framing the global climate change mitigation challenge as one of accelerating a socio-technical transition or transformation, shifting development pathways accordingly, in addition to (or rather than) solving a global commons problem. This chapter draws from theory to identify a set of criteria by which to assess the effectiveness of existing forms of international cooperation.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The rest of this chapter describes existing cooperative international agreements, institutions, and initiatives with a view to clarifying how they operate, what effects they have, and ultimately, whether they work. At the heart of this international institutional architecture lies the Paris Agreement, which sets the overall approach for international cooperation under the UNFCCC at the global level. In many ways, the Paris Agreement reshapes the structure of such cooperation, from one oriented primarily towards target setting, monitoring, and enforcement, to one that is oriented towards supporting and enabling nationally determined actions (including targets), monitoring as well as catalysing non-state and sub-national actions at multiple levels of governance. In addition to the Paris Agreement, many forms of cooperation have taken shape in parallel: those designed to address other environmental problems that have a significant impact on climate mitigation; those operating at the sub-global or sectoral level; and those where the main participants are non-state actors. The chapter ends with an overall assessment of the effectiveness of current international cooperation and identifies areas that would benefit from improved and enhanced action.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="14.1.1"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.1.1</span>Key Findings From the Fifth Assessment Report <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-1-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The AR5 found that two characteristics of climate change make international cooperation essential: that it is a global commons problem that needs to be addressed in a coordinated fashion at the global scale; and that given the global diversity with respect to opportunities for and cost of mitigation, there are economic efficiencies associated with cooperative solutions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Laws" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2.1">Section 13.2.1</a>.1). Consequently, AR5 found evidence to suggest that climate policies that are implemented across geographical regions would be more effective in terms of both their environmental consequences and their economic costs (Sections 13.6, 13.13 and 14.4). The AR5 also suggested that regional cooperation could offer opportunities beyond what countries may be able to achieve by themselves. These opportunities are due to geographic proximity, shared infrastructure and policy frameworks, trade, and cross-border investments, and examples included renewable energy pools across borders, networks of energy infrastructure and coordinated forestry policies (Sections 1.2, 6.6, 14.2 and 15.2). The AR5 also suggested that policy linkages exist across regional, national, and sub-national scales (Sections 13.3.1 and 13.5.1.3). For these reasons, AR5 suggested that although the UNFCCC remains the primary international forum for climate negotiations, many other institutions engaged at the global, regional, and local levels do and should play an active role (Sections 13.3.1, 13.4.1.4 and 13.5). AR5 also noted that the inclusion of climate change issues across a variety of forums often creates institutional linkages between mitigation and adaptation (Sections 13.3–13.5). In addition to centralised cooperation and governance, with a primary focus on the UNFCCC and its associated institutions, AR5 noted the emergence of new transnational climate-related institutions of decentralised authority such as public-private sector partnerships, private sector governance initiatives, transnational non-governmental organisation (NGO) programmes, and city-led initiatives (Sections 13.2, 13.3.1 and 13.12). It noted that these have resulted in a multiplicity of cooperative efforts in the form of multilateral agreements, harmonised national policies and decentralised but coordinated national and regional policies (Sections 13.3.2, 13.4.1 and 14.4). Finally, it suggested that international cooperation may also have a role in promoting active engagement of the private sector in technological innovation and cooperative efforts leading to technology transfer and the development of new technologies (Sections 13.3, 13.9 and 13.12).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="14.1.2"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.1.2</span>Developments Since the Fifth Assessment Report <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-2-siblings"><div class="h3-container" id="14.1.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered-under-H2" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.1.2.1</span>Negotiation of the Paris Agreement <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-1-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The key development since AR5 has been the negotiation and adoption of the Paris Agreement, which, building on the UNFCCC, introduces a new approach to global climate governance. This new approach, as discussed below (<a class="section-link" data-title=" Instruments and Milestones" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.1.1">Section 14.3.1.1</a>), is driven by the need to engage developing countries in emissions reductions beyond those they had taken on voluntarily under the Cancun Agreements, extend mitigation commitments to those developed countries that had rejected or withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, and to respond to the rapidly changing geopolitical context (<a class="section-link" data-title="Negotiating Context and Dynamics" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.1.2">Section 14.3.1.2</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="14.1.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.1.2.2</span>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-2-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">It has long been clear that a failure to mitigate climate change would exacerbate existing poverty, accentuate vulnerability and worsen inequality (Denton at al. 2014), but there is an emerging attempt to harmonise mitigation actions with those oriented towards social and economic development. A key development since AR5 is the adoption in 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which contains 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This Agenda offers an aspirational narrative, coherent framework and actionable agenda for addressing diverse issues of development through goals that balance the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development as well as issues of governance and institutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#ICSU%20ISSC--2015">ICSU ISSC 2015</a>). Scholars have noted that these dimensions of sustainable development are inter-dependent (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nilsson--2016">Nilsson et al. 2016</a>), and, as such it is difficult if not impossible to achieve economic and social gains while neglecting environmental concerns, including climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Le%20Blanc--2015">Le Blanc 2015</a>). The SDGs are closely linked to the Paris Agreement, adopted a few weeks later. There is a growing body of literature that examines the interlinkages between SDGs, including SDG 13 (taking urgent action to combat climate change) and others, concluding that without a proper response to climate change, success in many of the other SDGs would be difficult if not impossible (<a class="reference-link" href="#ICSU%20ISSC--2015">ICSU ISSC 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Le%20Blanc--2015">Le Blanc 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nilsson--2016">Nilsson et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Weitz--2018">Weitz et al. 2018</a>). Likewise, failure to achieve the SDGs will have a detrimental effect on the ability to limit climate change to manageable levels. Initiatives such as The World in 2050 (<a class="reference-link" href="#TWI2050--2018">TWI2050 2018</a>), a large research initiative by a global consortium of research and policy institutions, work on the premise that pursuing climate action and sustainable development in an integrated and coherent way, based on a sound understanding of development pathways and dynamics, is the strongest approach to enable countries to achieve their objectives in both agreements.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="14.1.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.1.2.3</span>IPCC Special Reports <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-3-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Further key developments since AR5 include the release of three IPCC special reports.

While the events that have unfolded since the report are not yet comprehensively documented in literature, arguably the report has led to a renewed perception of the urgency of climate mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wolf--2019">Wolf et al. 2019</a>). In particular, the report appears to have crystalised media coverage in some parts of the world around a need to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 (whether of GHGs or CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>), rather than delaying such reductions until the latter half of the century, as had been previously understood and indicated in the Paris Agreement. Its release is hence one factor explaining the rise in transnational climate mobilisation efforts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Boykoff--2019">Boykoff and Pearman 2019</a>). It has also played a role, in addition to the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Geden--2016a">Geden 2016a</a>), in the numerous announcements, pledges and indications by governments, including by all G7 countries, of their adoption of net zero GHG targets for 2050.

There has been no literature directly tying the publication of these latter two reports to changes in international cooperation.

In this report, by contrast, multiple framings are considered. <a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction and Framing" href="/chapters/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> introduces four analytic frameworks: aggregated economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis, which maps onto the global commons framing; ethical approaches; analysis of transitions and transformations; and psychology and politics of changing course. Here, we highlight some of the findings that are of relevance to international cooperation.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">When applied to the international context, the public good (or global commons) framing stresses that the incentives for mitigation at the global level are greater than they are for any single country, since the latter does not enjoy the benefits of its own mitigation efforts that accrue outside its own borders (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stavins--2014">Stavins et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2017">Patt 2017</a>). This framing does not preclude countries engaging in mitigation, even ambitious mitigation, but it suggests that these countries’ level of ambition and speed of abatement would be greater if they were part of a cooperative agreement.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Theoretical economists have shown that reaching such a global agreement is difficult, due to countries’ incentives to free-ride, namely benefit from other countries’ abatement efforts while failing to abate themselves (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--1994">Barrett 1994</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gollier--2015">Gollier and Tirole 2015</a>). Numerical models that integrate game theoretic concepts, whether based on optimal control theory or on dynamic programming, consistently confirm this insight, at least in the absence of transfers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Germain--2003">Germain et al. 2003</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lessmann--2015">Lessmann et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chander--2017">Chander 2017</a>). Recent contributions suggest that regional or sectoral agreements, or agreements focused on a particular subset of GHGs, can be seen as building blocks towards a global approach (<a class="reference-link" href="#Asheim--2006">Asheim et al. 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Froyn--2008">Froyn and Hovi 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sabel--2017">Sabel and Victor 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stewart--2017">Stewart et al. 2017</a>). In a dynamic context, this gradual approach through building blocks can alleviate the free-riding problem and ultimately lead to global cooperation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caparr%C3%B3s--2017">Caparrós and Péreau 2017</a>). Much of this literature is subsumed under the concept of ‘climate clubs’ described in the next section. Other developments based on dynamic game theory suggest that the free-riding problem can be mitigated if the treaties do not prescribe countries’ levels of green investment and the duration of the agreement, as countries can credibly threaten potential free-riders with a short-term agreement where green investments will be insufficient due to the hold-up problem (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battaglini--2016">Battaglini and Harstad 2016</a>). Finally, thresholds and potential climate catastrophes have also been shown, theoretically and numerically, to reduce free-riding incentives, especially for countries that may become pivotal in failing to avoid the threshold (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--2013">Barrett 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Emmerling--2020">Emmerling et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In addition to mitigation in the form of emissions abatement, innovation in green technologies also has public good features, leading for the same reasons to less innovation than would be globally ideal (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jaffe--2005">Jaffe et al. 2005</a>). Here as well, theory suggests that there are benefits from cooperation on technology development at the regional or sectoral levels, but also that cooperation on technology, especially for breakthrough technologies, may prove to be easier than for abatement (<a class="reference-link" href="#El-Sayed--2014">El-Sayed and Rubio 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rubio--2017">Rubio 2017</a>). In a dynamic context, the combination of infrastructure lock-in, network effects with high switching cost, and dynamic market failures suggests that deployment and adoption of clean technologies is path dependent (<a class="reference-link" href="#Acemoglu--2012">Acemoglu et al. 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Aghion--2014">Aghion et al. 2014</a>), with a multiplicity of possible equilibria. This implies that no outcome is guaranteed, although the most likely pathway will depend on economic expectations and initial conditions of the innovation process (<a class="reference-link" href="#Krugman--1991">Krugman 1991</a>). Therefore, the government has a role to play, either by shifting expectations (e.g., credibly committing to climate policy), or by changing initial conditions (e.g., investing in green infrastructure or subsidising clean energy research) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Acemoglu--2012">Acemoglu et al. 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Aghion--2014">Aghion et al. 2014</a>). This result is exacerbated by the irreversibility of energy investments and the extremely long periods of operation of the typical energy investment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caparr%C3%B3s--2015">Caparrós et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Baldwin--2020">Baldwin et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While the public goods and global commons framing concentrates on free-riding incentives as the primary barrier to mitigation taking place at a pace that would be globally optimal, other factors arise across the four analytic frameworks. For example, within the political framework, <a class="reference-link" href="#Beiser-McGrath--2021">Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer (2021)</a> highlight that not just the incentive to free-ride, but also the knowledge that another major emitter is free-riding, could lessen a country’s political incentive to mitigate. <a class="reference-link" href="#Aklin--2020">Aklin and Mildenberger (2020)</a> present evidence to suggest that distributive conflict within countries, rather than free-riding across countries, is the primary barrier to ambitious national-level action. Another barrier could be a lack of understanding and experience with particular policy approaches; there is evidence that participation in cooperative agreements could facilitate information exchange across borders and lead to enhanced mitigation policy adoption (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rashidi--2018">Rashidi and Patt 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The analytic approach focusing on transitions and transformation focuses on path-dependent processes as an impediment to the shift to low-carbon technologies and systems. Cross-Chapter Box 12 on Transition Dynamics (Chapter 16) summarises the key points of this literature. This chapter describes how the two framings focus on different indicators of progress, and potentially different types of cooperative action within the international context. This chapter highlights in later sections conflicting views on whether the Paris Agreement is likely to prove effective (<a class="section-link" data-title="Effectiveness of the Paris Agreement" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.3.2">Section 14.3.3.2</a>). To some extent, the dichotomy of views aligns with the two framings: analysis implicitly aligned with the global commons framing is negative about the Paris architecture, whereas that aligned with the transitions framing is more positive (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2016">Kern and Rogge 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2017">Patt 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2018">Roberts et al. 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Within the global commons framing, the primary indicator of progress is the actual level of GHG emissions, and the effectiveness of policies can be measured in terms of whether such emissions rise or fall (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2017">Patt 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hanna--2021">Hanna and Victor 2021</a>). The fact that the sum of all countries’ emissions has continued to grow (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC 2018a</a>), even as there has been a global recognition that they should decline, is seen as being consistent with the absence of a strong global agreement. Within this framing, there is traditionally an emphasis on treaties’ containing self-enforcing agreements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Olmstead--2012">Olmstead and Stavins 2012</a>), ideally through binding commitments, as a way of dealing with the overarching problem of free-ridership (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--1994">Barrett 1994</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Finus--2015">Finus and Caparrós 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tulkens--2019">Tulkens 2019</a>). However, as discussed above, the emphasis has now shifted to a gradual cooperation approach, either regional or sectoral, as an alternative way of dealing with free-riding incentives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caparr%C3%B3s--2017">Caparrós and Péreau 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sabel--2017">Sabel and Victor 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stewart--2017">Stewart et al. 2017</a>). The gradual linkage of emissions trading systems (discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Cooperative Mechanisms and Markets" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.4.4">Section 14.4.4</a>), goes in the same direction. There is also literature suggesting that the diversity of the countries involved may in fact be an asset to reduce the free-rider incentive (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pavlova--2013">Pavlova and De Zeeuw 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Finus--2019">Finus and McGinty 2019</a>), which argues in favour of a system where all countries, irrespectively of their income levels, are fully involved in mitigation, unlike the Kyoto Protocol and in line with the Paris Agreement. Finally, recent efforts have discussed potential synergies between mitigation and adaptation efforts in a strategic context (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bayramoglu--2018">Bayramoglu et al. 2018</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Linkages with Sustainable Development, Adaptation, Loss and Damage, and Human Rights" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.1.2">Section 14.5.1.2</a>) In general, current efforts go beyond considering climate policy as a mitigation-only issue, much in line with the discussion about linkages between climate change and sustainable development policies described in detail in Chapters 1 and 4 of this report.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In the transitions framing, by contrast, global emissions levels are viewed as the end (and often greatly delayed) result of a large number of transformative processes. International cooperation may be effective at stimulating such processes, even if a change in global emissions is not yet evident, implying that short-term changes in emissions levels may be a misleading indicator of progress towards long-term goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2017">Patt 2017</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Hanna--2021">Hanna and Victor (2021)</a> suggest a particular focus on technical advances and deployment patterns in niche low-carbon technologies, such as wind and solar power, and electric vehicles. However, this is one among many suggestions: the literature does not identify a single clear indicator to use, and there are many metrics of technological progress and transformation, described in <a class="section-link" data-title="Indicators for Technological Innovation" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.3.3">Section 16.3.3</a> of this report. These can include national-level emissions among countries participating in particular forms of cooperation, as well as leading indicators of such emissions such as changes in low-carbon technology deployment and cost.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Just as the transition framing highlights indicators of progress other than global emissions, it de-emphasises the importance of achieving cost-effectiveness with respect to global emissions. Hence, this strand of the literature does not generally support the use of international carbon markets, suggesting that these can delay transformative processes within countries that are key drivers of technological change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cullenward--2020">Cullenward and Victor 2020</a>). For similar reasons, achieving cross-sectoral cost-effectiveness, a goal of many carbon markets, is not seen as a high priority. Instead, within the transitions framing, the emphasis with respect to treaty design is often on providing mechanisms to support Parties’ voluntary actions, such as with financial and capacity-building support for new technologies and technology regimes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2019">Victor et al. 2019</a>). The transitions literature also highlights impediments to transformation as being sector specific, and hence the importance of international cooperation addressing sector-specific issues (<a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2019">Victor et al. 2019</a>). While such attention often starts with promoting innovation and diffusion of low-carbon technologies that are critical to a sector’s functioning, it often ends with policies aimed at phasing out the high-carbon technologies once they are no longer needed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Markard--2018">Markard 2018</a>). In line with this, many scholars have suggested value in supply-side international agreements, aimed at phasing out the production and use of fossil fuels (Collier and Venables 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Piggot--2018">Piggot et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Asheim--2019">Asheim et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Newell--2020">Newell and Simms 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Analytic approaches centred on equity and development figure prominently within this report, with many of the key concepts addressed in Chapter 4. Primarily the focus is on aligning climate policy at the international level with efforts to shift development pathways towards improved quality of life and greater sustainability (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4). There are also overlaps between the equity framework and the others. Within the global commons framing, the emphasis is on international carbon markets to reduce the costs from climate policies, and as way of generating financial flows to developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2019a">Michaelowa et al. 2019a</a>). The transitions framing, while focused empirically primarily on industrialised countries, nevertheless aligns with an understanding of climate mitigation taking place within a wider development agenda; in many cases it is a lack of development that creates a barrier to rapid system transformation, which international cooperation can address (<a class="reference-link" href="#Delina--2018">Delina and Sovacool 2018</a>) (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="14.2.2"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.2.2</span>Climate Clubs and Building Blocks <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-4-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A recent development in the literature on international climate governance has been increased attention to the potential for climate clubs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2011">Victor 2011</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Hovi--2016">Hovi et al. (2016)</a> define these as ‘any international actor group that (1) starts with fewer members than the UNFCCC has and (2) aims to cooperate on one or more climate change-related activities, notably mitigation, adaptation, climate engineering or climate compensation’. While providing public goods (such as mitigation), they also offer member-only benefits (such as preferential tariff rates) to entice membership. In practice, climate clubs are sub-global arrangements, and formal agreement by interstate treaty is not a prerequisite. Actors do not have to be states, although in the literature on climate clubs states have hitherto dominated. The literature has an essentially static dimension that focuses on the incentives for actors to join such a club, and a dynamic one which focuses on the ‘building blocks’ for global cooperative agreements.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The literature focusing on the static aspects of clubs highlight that they represent ‘coalitions of the willing’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2016a">Falkner 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gampfer--2016">Gampfer 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2021">Falkner et al. 2021</a>), which offer a package of benefits, part of which are pure public goods (available also to non-club members), and others are club benefits that are only available to members (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hovi--2016">Hovi et al. 2016</a>). The members-only or excludable part can be a system of transfers within the club to compensate the countries with higher costs. For example, the benefit from participating in the club can be to have access to a common emissions trading system, which in general is more attractive the larger the diversity of the countries involved, although this is not a general result, as discussed in detail in <a class="reference-link" href="#Doda--2017">Doda and Taschini (2017)</a>. However, as costs and effort-sharing agreements are unsuccessful in a static context (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--1994">Barrett 1994</a>), mainly due to free-rider incentives, several studies have proposed using tariffs on trade or other forms of sanctions to reduce incentives for free-riding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Helm--2000">Helm and Sprinz 2000</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eyland--2012">Eyland and Zaccour 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Anouli%C3%A8s--2015">Anouliès 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nordhaus--2015">Nordhaus 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Al%20Khourdajie--2020">Al Khourdajie and Finus 2020</a>). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Nordhaus--2015">Nordhaus (2015)</a> uses a coalition formation game model to show that a uniform percentage tariff on the imports from nonparticipants into the club region (at a relatively low tariff rate of about 2%) can induce high participation within a range of carbon price values.

However, more recent literature suggests that climate clubs complement rather than challenge the international regime established by the UNFCCC (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Asselt--2014">van Asselt and Zelli 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2016a">Falkner 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dragulji%C4%87--2019">Draguljić 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In this dynamic context, one question is whether to negotiate a single global agreement or to start with smaller agreements in the hope that they will eventually evolve into a larger agreement. It has been debated extensively in the context of free trade whether a multilateral (global) negotiating approach is preferable to a regional approach, seen as a building block towards global free trade. <a class="reference-link" href="#Aghion--2007">Aghion et al. (2007)</a> analysed this issue formally for trade, showing that a leader would always choose to move directly to a global agreement. In the case of climate change, it appears that even the mildest form of club discussed above (an efforts and costs sharing agreement, as in the case of the linkage of emissions trading systems) can yield global cooperation following a building blocks approach, and that the sequential path relying on building blocks may be the only way to reach global cooperation over time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caparr%C3%B3s--2017">Caparrós and Péreau 2017</a>). While the existence of a nearly universal agreement such as the Paris Agreement may arguably have rendered this discussion less relevant, the Paris Agreement co-exists, and will likely continue to do so, with a multitude of sectoral and regional agreements, meaning that this discussion is still relevant for the evolution of these complementary regimes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Results based on an agent-based model suggest that climate clubs result in major emissions reductions if there is a sufficiently high provision of the club good and if initial membership by several states with sufficient emissions weight materialises. Such configurations allow the club to grow over time to enable effective global action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hovi--2017">Hovi et al. 2017</a>). The departure of a major emitter (specifically the United States) triggered a scientific discussion on the stability of the Paris Agreement. <a class="reference-link" href="#Sprinz--2018">Sprinz et al. (2018)</a> <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> explore whether climate clubs are stable against a leader willing to change its status, for example, from leader to follower, or even completely leaving the climate club, finding in most cases such stability to exist. Related studies on the macroeconomic incentives for climate clubs by <a class="reference-link" href="#Paroussos--2019">Paroussos et al. (2019)</a> show that climate clubs are reasonably stable, both internally and externally (i.e., no member willing to leave and no new member willing to join), and climate clubs that include obligations in line with the 2°C goal combined with financial incentives can facilitate technology diffusion. The authors also show that preferential trade arrangements for low-carbon goods can reduce the macroeconomic effects of mitigation policies. <a class="reference-link" href="#Aakre--2018">Aakre et al. (2018)</a> show numerically that small groups of countries can limit black carbon in the Arctic, driven mainly for reasons of self-interest, yet reducing methane requires larger coalitions due to its larger geographical dispersal and requires stronger cooperation.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="14.2.3"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.2.3</span>Assessment Criteria <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-5-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section identifies a set of criteria for assessing the effectiveness of international cooperation, which is applied later in the chapter. Lessons from the implementation of other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) can provide some guidance. There is considerable literature on this topic, most of which predates AR5, and which will therefore not be covered in detail. Issues include ways to enhance compliance, and the fact that a low level of compliance with an MEA does not necessarily mean that the MEA has no effect (<a class="reference-link" href="#Downs--1996">Downs et al. 1996</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--1998">Victor et al. 1998</a>; Weiss and Jacobson 1998). Recent research examines effectiveness from the viewpoint of the extent to which an MEA influences domestic action, including the adoption of implementing legislation and policies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brandi--2019">Brandi et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Many have pointed to the Montreal Protocol, addressing stratospheric ozone loss, as an example of a successful treaty because of its ultimate environmental effectiveness, and relevance for solving climate change. Scholarship emerging since AR5 emphasises that the Paris Agreement has a greater ‘bottom-up’ character than many other MEAs, including the Montreal or Kyoto Protocols, allowing for more decentralised ‘polycentric’ forms of governance that engage diverse actors at the regional, national and sub-national levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ostrom--2010">Ostrom 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jordan--2015">Jordan et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2016b">Falkner 2016b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2016">Victor 2016</a>). Given the differences in architecture, lessons drawn from studies of MEA regimes need to be supplemented with assessments of the effectiveness of cooperative efforts at other governance levels and in other forums. Emerging research in this area proposes methodologies for this task (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hsu--2019a">Hsu et al. 2019a</a>). Findings highlight the persistence of similar imbalances between developed and developing countries as at the global level, as well as the need for more effective ways to incentivise private sector engagement in transnational climate governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2018">Chan et al. 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While environmental outcomes and economic performance have been long-standing criteria for assessment of effectiveness, the other elements deserve some note. It is the case that the achievement of climate objectives, such as limiting global average warming to 1.5°C–2°C, will require the transition from high- to low-carbon technologies and the transformation of the sectors and social environments within which those technologies operate. Such transformations are not linear processes, and hence many of the early steps taken – such as supporting early diffusion of new renewable energy technologies – will have little immediate effect on GHG emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2015">Patt 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2017">Geels et al. 2017</a>). Hence, activities that contribute to transformative potential include technology transfer and financial support for low-carbon infrastructure, especially where the latter is not tied to immediate emissions reductions. Assessing the transformative potential of international cooperation takes these factors into account. Equity and distributive outcomes are of central importance to the climate change debate, and hence for evaluating the effects of policies. Equity encompasses the notion of distributive justice which refers to the distribution of goods, burdens, costs and benefits, as well as procedural-related issues (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kverndokk--2018">Kverndokk 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Finally, the literature on the performance of other MEAs highlights the importance of institutional strength, which can include regulative quality, mechanisms to enhance transparency and accountability, and administrative capacity. <span class="•-Condensed-italic"></span>Regulative quality includes guidance and signalling (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oberth%C3%BCr--2017">Oberthür et al. 2017</a>), as well as clear rules and standards to facilitate collective action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oberth%C3%BCr--2016">Oberthür and Bodle 2016</a>). The literature is clear that legally-binding obligations (which require the formal expression of state consent) and non-binding recommendations can each be appropriate, depending on the particular circumstances (<a class="reference-link" href="#Skj%C3%A6rseth--2006">Skjærseth et al. 2006</a>), and indeed it has been argued that for climate change non-binding recommendations may better fit the capacity of global governance organisations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2011">Victor 2011</a>). <span class="•-Condensed-italic"></span>Mechanisms to enhance transparency and accountability are essential to collect, protect, and analyse relevant data about Parties’ implementation of their obligations, and to identify and address challenges in implementation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kramarz--2016">Kramarz and Park 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kinley--2020">Kinley et al. 2020</a>).

regime, in evolution for three decades, comprises the 1992 UNFCCC, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and the 2015 Paris Agreement. The UNFCCC is a ‘framework’ convention, capturing broad convergence among states on an objective, a set of principles, and general obligations relating to mitigation, adaptation, reporting and support. The UNFCCC categorises Parties into Annex I and Annex II. Annex I Parties, comprising developed country Parties, have a goal to return, individually or jointly, their GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Annex II Parties, comprising developed country Parties except for those with economies in transition, have additional obligations relating to the provision of financial and technology support. Parties including developing country Parties, characterised as non-Annex-I Parties, have reporting obligations, as well as obligations to take policies and measures on mitigation and adaptation. The UNFCCC also establishes the institutional building blocks for global climate governance. Both the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement are distinct but ‘related legal instruments’ in that only Parties to the UNFCCC can be Parties to these later instruments.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The Kyoto Protocol specifies GHG emissions reduction targets for the 2008–2012 commitment period for countries listed in its Annex B (which broadly corresponds to Annex I to the UNFCCC) (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--1997">UNFCCC 1997</a>, Art. 3 and Annex B). The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005. Shortly thereafter, states began negotiating a second commitment period under the Protocol for Annex B Parties, as well as initiating a process under the UNFCCC to consider long-term cooperation among all Parties.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">At the 13th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP13) in Bali in 2007, Parties adopted the Bali Action Plan which launched negotiations aimed at an agreed outcome enhancing the UNFCCC’s ‘full, effective and sustained implementation’. The agreed outcome was to be adopted at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, but negotiations failed to deliver a consensus document. The result instead was the Copenhagen Accord <span class="•-Condensed-italic">, </span> which was taken note of by the COP. While it was a political agreement with no formal legal status under the UNFCCC, it reflected significant progress on several fronts and set in place the building blocks for the Paris Agreement, namely: setting a goal of limiting global temperature increase to below 2°C; calling on all countries to put forward mitigation pledges; establishing broad new terms for the reporting and verification of countries’ actions; setting a goal of mobilising USD100 billion a year by 2020 from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance; and, calling for the establishment of a new Green Climate Fund and Technology Mechanism (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2010">Rajamani 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2010">Rogelj et al. 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2010a">UNFCCC 2010a</a>). One hundred and forty states endorsed the Copenhagen Accord, with 85 countries entering pledges to reduce their emissions or constrain their growth by 2020 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Christensen--2019">Christensen and Olhoff 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">At COP16 in Cancun in 2010, Parties adopted a set of decisions termed the Cancun Agreements that effectively formalised the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord, and the pledges states made, under the UNFCCC. The Cancun Agreements were regarded as an interim arrangement through to 2020, and Parties left the door open to further negotiations, in line with negotiations launched in 2005, toward a legally-binding successor to the Kyoto Protocol (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freestone--2010">Freestone 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2011a">Liu 2011a</a>). Collectively the G20 states are on track to meeting the mid level of their Cancun pledges, although there is uncertainty about some individual pledges. However, there is significant gap between annual emissions expected under full implementation of pledges and the level consistent with the 2°C goal (<a class="reference-link" href="#Christensen--2019">Christensen and Olhoff 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">At the 2011 Durban climate conference, Parties launched negotiations for ‘a Protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force’ with a scheduled end to the negotiations in 2015 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2012">UNFCCC 2012</a>, Dec. 1, para. 2). At the 2012 Doha climate conference, Parties adopted a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, running from 2013–2020. The Doha Amendment entered into force on 31 December 2020. Given the subsequent adoption of the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol is unlikely to continue beyond 2020 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2017a">Bodansky et al. 2017a</a>). At the end of the compliance assessment period under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex B Parties were in full compliance with their targets for the first commitment period; in some cases through the use of the Protocol’s flexibility mechanisms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shishlov--2016">Shishlov et al. 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Although both the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement are under the UNFCCC, they are generally seen as representing fundamentally different approaches to international cooperation on climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Held--2018">Held and Roger 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2016b">Falkner 2016b</a>). The Paris Agreement has been characterised as a ‘decisive break’ from the Kyoto Protocol (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keohane--2016">Keohane and Oppenheimer 2016</a>). Some note that the mitigation efforts under the Kyoto Protocol take the form of targets that, albeit based on national self-selection, were part of the multilateral negotiation process, whereas under the Paris Agreement Parties make Nationally Determined Contributions. The different approaches have been characterised by some as a distinction between a ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ approach (Bodansky and Rajamani 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2016">Bodansky et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2016">Chan et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Doelle--2016">Doelle 2016</a>) but others disagree with such a characterisation, pointing to continuities within the regime, for example, in terms of rules for reporting and review, and crossover and use of common institutional arrangements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Depledge--2017">Depledge 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Allan--2019">Allan 2019</a>). Some note, in any case, that the Kyoto Protocol’s core obligations are substantive obligations of result, while many of the Paris Agreement’s core obligations are procedural obligations, complemented by obligations of conduct (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2016a">Rajamani 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mayer--2018a">Mayer 2018a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The differences between and continuities in the three treaties that comprise the UN climate regime are summarised in Table 14.3. The Kyoto targets apply only to Annex I Parties, but the procedural obligations relating to NDCs in the Paris Agreement apply to all Parties, with flexibilities in relation to some obligations for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and developing countries that need them in light of their capacities. The Kyoto targets are housed in its Annex B, therefore requiring a formal process of amendment for revision, whereas the Paris NDCs are located in an online registry that is maintained by the Secretariat, but to which Parties can upload their own NDCs. The Kyoto Protocol allows Annex B Parties to use three market-based mechanisms – the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Joint Implementation and International Emissions Trading – to fulfil a part of their GHG targets. The Paris Agreement recognises that Parties may choose to cooperate voluntarily on markets, in the form of cooperative approaches under Article 6.2, and a mechanism with international oversight under Article 6.4, subject to guidance and rules that are yet to be adopted. These rules relate to integrity and accounting (<a class="reference-link" href="#La%20Hoz%20Theuer--2019">La Hoz Theuer et al. 2019</a>). Article 5 also provides explicit endorsement of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and fostering conservation (REDD+). The Kyoto Protocol contains an extensive reporting and review process, backed by a compliance mechanism. This mechanism includes an enforcement branch, to ensure compliance, and sanction non-compliance (through the withdrawal of benefits such as participation in market-based mechanisms), with its national system requirements, and GHG targets. By contrast, the Paris Agreement relies on informational requirements and flows to enhance the clarity of NDCs, and to track progress in the implementation and achievement of NDCs.</p><p

class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The 2015 Paris Agreement was negotiated in a starkly different geopolitical context to that of the 1992 UNFCCC and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (<a class="reference-link" href="#Streck--2013">Streck and Terhalle 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ciplet--2015">Ciplet et al. 2015</a>). The ‘rupturing binary balance of superpowers’ of the 1980s had given way to a multipolar world with several distinctive trends: emerging economies began challenging US dominance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ciplet--2015">Ciplet et al. 2015</a>); industrialised countries’ emissions peaked in the 2010s and started declining, while emissions from emerging economies began to grow (<a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2019">Falkner 2019</a>); the EU stretched eastwards and became increasingly supra-national (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kinley--2020">Kinley et al. 2020</a>); disparities within the group of developing countries increased (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ciplet--2015">Ciplet et al. 2015</a>); and the role of non-state actors in mitigation efforts has grown more salient (Bäckstrand et al. 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuyper--2018b">Kuyper et al. 2018b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2019">Falkner 2019</a>). The rise of emerging powers, many of whom now have ‘veto power’, however, some noted, did not detract from the unequal development and inequality at the heart of global environmental politics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hurrell--2012">Hurrell and Sengupta 2012</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In this altered context, unlike in the 1990s when the main cleavages were between the EU and the US (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hurrell--2012">Hurrell and Sengupta 2012</a>), US–China ‘great power politics’ came to be seen as determinative of outcomes in the climate change negotiations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Terhalle--2013">Terhalle and Depledge 2013</a>). The US–China joint announcement (Whitehouse 2014), for instance, before the 2014 Lima climate conference, brokered the deal on differentiation that came to be embodied in the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2016a">Rajamani 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ciplet--2017">Ciplet and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2017">Roberts 2017</a> ). Others have identified, on the basis of economic standing, political influence, and emissions levels, three influential groups – the first comprising the USA with Japan, Canada, and Russia, the second comprising the EU and the third comprising China, India and Brazil (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brenton--2013">Brenton 2013</a>). The emergence of the Major Economies Fora, among other climate clubs (discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Clubs and Building Blocks" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.2.2">Section 14.2.2</a>) reflects this development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brenton--2013">Brenton 2013</a>). It also represents a ‘minilateral’ forum, built on a recognition of power asymmetries, in which negotiating compromises are politically tested and fed into multilateral processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Falkner--2016a">Falkner 2016a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Beyond these countries, in the decade leading up to the Paris climate negotiations, increasing differences within the group of developing countries divided the 134-strong developing country alliance of the G77/China into several interest-based coalitions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vihma--2011">Vihma et al. 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2017b">Bodansky et al. 2017b</a>). A division emerged between the vulnerable least developed and small island states on the one side and rapidly developing economies, the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) on the other, as the latter are ‘decidedly not developed but not wholly developing’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hochstetler--2013">Hochstetler and Milkoreit 2013</a>). This fissure in part led to the High Ambition Coalition in Paris between vulnerable countries and the more progressive industrialised countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ciplet--2017">Ciplet and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2017">Roberts 2017</a> ). A division also emerged between the BASIC countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hurrell--2012">Hurrell and Sengupta 2012</a>), that each have distinctive identities and positions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hochstetler--2013">Hochstetler and Milkoreit 2013</a>). In the lead up to the Paris negotiations, China and India formed the Like-Minded Developing Countries with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our Americas (ALBA) countries, to resist the erosion of differentiation in the regime. Yet, the ‘complex and competing’ identities of India and China, with differing capacities, challenges and self-images, have also influenced the negotiations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ciplet--2017">Ciplet and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2017">Roberts 2017</a> ; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2017">Rajamani 2017</a>). Other developing countries’ coalitions also played an important role in striking the final deal in Paris. The Alliance of Small Island States, despite their lack of structural power, played a leading role, in particular in relation to the inclusion of the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal in the UN climate regime (Agueda Corneloup and Mol 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ourbak--2018">Ourbak and Magnan 2018</a>). The Association of the Latin American and Caribbean Countries (AILAC) that emerged in 2012 also played a decisive role in fostering ambition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Edwards--2017">Edwards et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Watts--2018">Watts and Depledge 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Leadership is essential to reaching international agreements and overcoming collective action problems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2015">Parker et al. 2015</a>). The Paris negotiations were faced, as a reflection of the multipolarity that had emerged, with a ‘fragmented leadership landscape’ with the USA, EU, and China being perceived as leaders at different points in time and to varying degrees (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karlsson--2012">Karlsson et al. 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2014">Parker et al. 2014</a>). Small island states are also credited with demonstrating ‘moral leadership’ (Agueda Corneloup and Mol 2014), and non-state and sub-national actors are beginning to be recognised as pioneers and leaders (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wurzel--2019">Wurzel et al. 2019</a>). There is also a burgeoning literature on the emergence of diffused leadership and the salience of followers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2014">Parker et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Busby--2020">Busby and Urpelainen 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">It is in the context of this complex, multipolar and highly differentiated world – with a heterogeneity of interests, constraints and capacities, increased contestations over shares of the carbon and development space, as well as diffused leadership – that the Paris Agreement was negotiated.

Although its legal form was heavily disputed, especially in the initial part of its four-year negotiating process (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2015">Rajamani 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maljean-Dubois--2016">Maljean-Dubois and Wemaëre 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2017b">Bodansky et al. 2017b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2017">Klein et al. 2017</a>), the Paris Agreement is a treaty containing provisions of differing levels of ‘bindingness’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2016">Bodansky 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oberth%C3%BCr--2016">Oberthür and Bodle 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2016b">Rajamani 2016b</a>). The legal character of provisions within a treaty, and the extent to which particular provisions lend themselves to assessments of compliance or non-compliance, depends on factors such as the normative content of the provision, the precision of its terms, the language used, and the oversight mechanisms in place (<a class="reference-link" href="#Werksman--2010">Werksman 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2015">Bodansky 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oberth%C3%BCr--2016">Oberthür and Bodle 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2016b">Rajamani 2016b</a>). Assessed on these criteria, the Paris Agreement contains the full spectrum of provisions, from hard to soft law (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2016b">Rajamani 2016b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pickering--2019">Pickering et al. 2019</a>) and even ‘non-law’, provisions that do not have standard-setting or normative content but which play a narrative-building and context-setting role (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2016b">Rajamani 2016b</a>). The Paris Agreement, along with the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, can be interpreted in light of the customary international law principle of harm prevention according to which states must exercise due diligence in seeking to prevent activities within their jurisdiction from causing extraterritorial environmental harm (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mayer--2016a">Mayer 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maljean-Dubois--2019">Maljean-Dubois 2019</a>). The key features of the Paris Agreement are set out in Box 14.1.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Figure 14.1 illustrates graphically the key features of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is based on a set of binding procedural obligations requiring Parties to ‘prepare, communicate, and maintain’ ‘Nationally Determined Contributions’ (NDCs) (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2015a">UNFCCC 2015a</a>, Art. 4.2) every five years (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2015a">UNFCCC 2015a</a>, Art. 4.9). These obligations are complemented by: (1) an ‘ambition cycle’ that expects Parties, informed by five-yearly global stocktakes (Art. 14), to submit successive NDCs representing a progression on their previous NDCs (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2015a">UNFCCC 2015a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2017b">Bodansky et al. 2017b</a>), and (2) an ‘enhanced transparency framework’ that places extensive informational demands on Parties, tailored to capacities, and establishes review processes to enable tracking of progress towards achievement of NDCs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oberth%C3%BCr--2016">Oberthür and Bodle 2016</a>). In contrast to the Kyoto Protocol with its internationally inscribed targets and timetable for emissions reduction for developed countries, the Paris Agreement contains Nationally Determined Contributions embedded in an international system of transparency and accountability for all countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Doelle--2016">Doelle 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maljean-Dubois--2016">Maljean-Dubois and Wemaëre 2016</a>) accompanied by a shared global goal, in particular in relation to a temperature limit.</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="figure-14-1"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_14_1.png"></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 14.1 | Key features of the Paris Agreement. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>Arrows illustrate the interrelationship between the different features of the Paris Agreement, in particular between the Agreement’s goals, required actions through NDCs, support (finance, technology and capacity building), transparency framework and global stocktake process.

The human rights implications of climate impacts garnered particular attention in the lead up to Paris (<a class="reference-link" href="#Duyck--2015">Duyck 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mayer--2016b">Mayer 2016b</a>). In particular, the Human Rights Council, its special procedures mechanisms, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, through a series of resolutions, reports, and activities, advocated a rights-based approach to climate impacts, and sought to integrate this approach in the climate change regime. The Paris Agreement’s preambular recital on human rights recommends that Parties, ‘when taking action to address human rights’, take into account ‘their respective obligations on human rights’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2015a">UNFCCC 2015a</a>, preambular recital 14), a first for an environmental treaty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Knox--2016">Knox 2016</a>).

National net-zero targets could be reflected in the long-term strategies that states are urged to submit under Article 4.19, but only a few states have submitted such strategies thus far. The Paris Rulebook, agreed at the Agreement’s first meeting of the Parties in 2018, further strengthens the operational relevance of the temperature goal by requiring Parties to provide information when submitting their NDCs on how these contribute towards achieving the objective identified in UNFCCC Article 2, and Paris Agreement Articles 2.1 (a) and 4.1 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2019b">UNFCCC 2019b</a>, Annex I, para. 7).

This suggests that not all countries are expected to reach net zero GHG emissions at the same time, or in the same manner. If global cost-effective 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios from integrated assessment models are taken, without applying an equity principle, the results suggest that domestic net zero GHG and CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions would be reached a decade earlier than the global average in Brazil and the USA and later in India and Indonesia (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Soest--2021">van Soest et al. 2021</a>).

International coordination and cooperation are crucial in enhancing the ambition of current pledges, as countries will be more willing to increase their ambition if matched by other countries (coordination) and if cost-minimising agreements between developed and developing countries, through Article 6 and other means, are fully developed (cooperation) (<a class="reference-link" href="#S%C3%A6len--2020">Sælen 2020</a>).</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="figure-14-2"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_14_2.png"></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 14.2 | The role of international cooperationin the reductions in annual emissions by 2030 needed to follow a 1. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">5°C (respectively &lt;2°C) </span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">cost-effective</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">path from 2020 onwards. </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>The figure represents the additional contribution of pledges included in the NDCs over current policies at the global level, and the remaining gap in emissions reductions needed to move from current policies to pathways that limit warning to 1.5°C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot, and those to limit warming to 2°C (&gt;67%).

Since AR5, a number of studies have done so. <a class="section-link" data-title="Emissions trends and drivers" href="/chapters/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> of this report lists at least 18 countries that have sustained absolute emissions reductions for at least a decade, nearly all of which are countries that had Kyoto targets for the first commitment period.

Once the EU tightened its rules and restricted the use of CDM credits in 2011, there was a sharp drop in the price of CDM credits in 2012. This price never recovered, as the demand for CDM was very weak after 2012, in part because of the difficulties encountered in securing the entry into force of the Doha Amendment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2019b">Michaelowa et al. 2019b</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Assessing the effectiveness of Kyoto’s market mechanisms is challenging, and the results have been mixed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aichele--2013">Aichele and Felbermayr 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Iwata--2014">Iwata and Okada 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuriyama--2018">Kuriyama and Abe 2018</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuriyama--2018">Kuriyama and Abe (2018)</a> assessed emissions reduction quantities taking into account heightened criteria for additionality.

Turning to the assessment criteria articulated in this chapter, the following preliminary assessments of the Paris Agreement can be made.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In relation to the criterion of <span class="•-Condensed-italic">environmental effectiveness</span>, the Paris Agreement exceeds the Kyoto Protocol in terms of coverage of GHGs and participation of states in mitigation actions. In terms of coverage of GHGs, the Kyoto Protocol limits its coverage to a defined basket of gases identified in its Annex A (carbon dioxide (CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>), methane (CH<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>), nitrous oxide (N<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>), as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>)). The Paris Agreement does not specify the coverage of gases, thus Parties may cover the full spectrum of GHGs in their NDCs as encouraged by the accounting provisions in Annex II to Decision 18/CMA.1 (or conversely they may choose to exclude important mitigation sectors) and there is also the possibility to include other pollutants such as short-lived climate forcers like black carbon. Article 4.4 calls on developed countries to undertake economy-wide emissions reduction targets with the expectation that developing country Parties will also move to introduce these over time. Moreover, the Paris Agreement makes express reference to Parties taking action to conserve and enhance ‘sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases’ (Article 5). As under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, this allows for coverage of land use, land-use change and forestry and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions, both CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> and other Kyoto Annex A gases, as well as methane (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pekkarinen--2020">Pekkarinen 2020</a>). A few countries, particularly LDCs, include quantified non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions reductions from the agricultural sector in their NDCs, and many others include agriculture in their economy-wide targets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Richards--2018">Richards et al. 2018</a>). Some studies find that agricultural development pathways with mitigation co-benefits can deliver 21–40% of needed mitigation for the ‘well below 2°C’ limit, thus necessitating ‘transformative technical and policy options’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wollenberg--2016">Wollenberg et al. 2016</a>). Other studies indicate that broader ‘natural climate solutions, including forests, can provide 37% of the cost-effective CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> mitigation needed through 2030 for a more than 66% chance of holding warming to below 2°C’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Griscom--2017">Griscom et al. 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As Figure 14.2 illustrates graphically, communicated unconditional NDCs, if achieved, lead to a reduction of about 7% of world emissions by 2030 in relation to the Kyoto GHGs, and NDCs with conditional elements increase this reduction to about 12% (<a class="reference-link" href="#den%20Elzen--2016">den Elzen et al. 2016</a>). Although there are uncertainties in the extent to which countries will meet the conditional elements of their NDCs, the experience with the Cancun pledges has been positive, as countries will collectively meet their pledges by 2020, and even individual pledges will be met in most cases, although arguably helped by the COVID-19 pandemic (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2020">UNEP 2020</a>). In any case, the main challenge that remains is to close the emissions gap, the difference between what has been pledged and what needs to be achieved by 2030 to reach a 1.5°C compatible path (respectively 2°C) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roelfsema--2020">Roelfsema et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2020">UNEP 2020</a>, see also Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4). In terms of participation of states in mitigation actions, the Paris Agreement performs better than the Kyoto Protocol. The latter contains mitigation targets only for developed countries listed in its Annex B, while the Paris Agreement extends binding procedural obligations in relation to mitigation contributions to all states. It is noted, however, that the Paris Agreement represented a weakening of commitments for those industrialised countries that were Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, although a strengthening for those that were not, and for developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oberth%C3%BCr--2020">Oberthür and Groen 2020</a>). Finally, some analysts have suggested that the recent proliferation of national mid-century net-zero targets – currently 127 countries have considered or adopted such targets – can be attributed, at least in part, to participation in the Paris Agreement and having agreed to its Article 4 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Climate%20Action%20Tracker--2020a">Climate Action Tracker 2020a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Day--2020">Day et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In relation to the criterion of <span class="•-Condensed-italic">transformative potential</span>, there is, as yet, limited empirical data or theoretical analysis on which to assess the Paris Agreement’s transformative potential.

There is limited evidence to suggest that this is underway, although there are arguments made that Paris has the right structure to achieve this. The linking of the UNFCCC financial apparatus, including the GCF, to the Paris Agreement, and the provisions on technology support and capacity building, provide potential avenues for promoting increased investment flows into low-carbon technologies and development pathways, as <a class="reference-link" href="#Labordena--2017">Labordena et al. (2017)</a> show in the case of solar energy development in Africa. Similarly, <a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2016">Kern and Rogge (2016)</a> argue that the Paris Agreement’s global commitment towards complete decarbonisation may play a critical role in accelerating underlying system transitions, by sending a strong signal as to the actions needed by national governments and other international support. <a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2019">Victor et al. (2019)</a> argue that international cooperation that enhances transformative potential needs to operate at the sectoral level, as the barriers to transformation are highly specific to each sector; the Paris Agreement’s broad consensus around a clear level of ambition sends a strong signal on what is needed in each sector, but on its own will do little unless bolstered with sector-specific action (Geels et al. 2019). On the less optimistic side, it is noted that the extent of the ‘investment signal’ sent by the Agreement to business is unclear (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kemp--2018">Kemp 2018</a>), and it is also unclear to what extent the Paris Agreement is fostering investment in break-through technologies. United States non-cooperation from 2017 to 2020 posed a significant threat to adequate investment flows through the GCF (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chai--2017">Chai et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Urpelainen--2018">Urpelainen and Van de Graaf 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In relation to the criterion of <span class="•-Condensed-italic">distributive outcomes, </span> the Paris Agreement performs well in some respects but less well in others, and its performance relative to the Kyoto Protocol is arguably lower in respect of some indicators such as industrialised country leadership, and differentiation in favour of developing countries. While the Kyoto Protocol implemented a multilaterally agreed burden-sharing arrangement set out in the UNFCCC and reflected in Annex-based differentiation in mitigation obligations, the Paris Agreement relies on NDCs, accompanied by self-assessments of the fairness of these contributions; some of these do not accord with equity principles of international environmental law, although it is worth noting that the Kyoto Protocol was also not fully consistent with such principles. At present, mechanisms in the Paris Agreement for promoting equitable burden sharing and evaluating the fairness of Parties’ contributions are undefined, although numerous proposals have been developed in the literature <a class="reference-link" href="#Herrala--2016">Herrala and Goel 2016</a>; (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ritchie--2017">Ritchie and Reay 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Robiou%20du%20Pont--2017">Robiou du Pont et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Alcaraz--2019">Alcaraz et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sheriff--2019">Sheriff 2019</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="NDCs, Fairness and Equity" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.2.3">Section 14.3.2.3</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Zimm--2020">Zimm and Nakicenovic (2020)</a> analysed the first set of NDCs and concluded that they would result in a decrease in the inequality of per capita emissions across countries. In relation to other indicators, such as the provision of support, the distributive outcomes of the Paris Agreement are dependent on the availability of support through mechanisms such as the GCF to meet the mitigation and adaptation financing needs of developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Antimiani--2017">Antimiani et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2018">Chan et al. 2018</a>). One study suggests that the implementation of the emissions reduction objectives stated in the NDCs implies trade-offs with poverty reduction efforts needed to achieve SDGs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Campagnolo--2019">Campagnolo and Davide 2019</a>), while other studies offer evidence that the immediate economic, environmental, and social benefits of mitigation in line with developing countries’ NDCs exceed those NDCs’ costs, and ultimately align with the SDGs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Antwi-Agyei--2018">Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vandyck--2018">Vandyck et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Caetano--2020">Caetano et al. 2020</a>) (Chapter 17). In relation to the promotion of co-benefits, the Paris Agreement has enhanced mechanisms for promoting co-benefits (e.g., in some cases for biodiversity conservation through the endorsement of REDD+ initiatives and activities) and linkages to sustainable development (e.g., through the Article 6.4 mechanism). Finally, in its preambular text the Paris Agreement endorses both a human rights perspective and the concept of just transitions, creating potential hooks for further elaboration and expansion of these principles in mitigation actions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">On the criterion of <span class="•-Condensed-italic">economic performance</span>, the Paris Agreement’s performance is potentially enhanced by the capacity for Parties to link mitigation policies, therefore improving aggregate cost-effectiveness. Voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement could facilitate such linkage of mitigation policies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2018">Chan et al. 2018</a>). A combination of common accounting rules and the absence of restrictive criteria and conditions on the use of ITMOs could accelerate linkage and increase the latitude of Parties to scale up the ambition of their NDCs. However, significant question marks remain over how the environmental integrity of traded emissions reductions can be ensured (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mehling--2019">Mehling 2019</a>). The ability of Article 6 to contribute to the goal of the Paris Agreement will depend on the extent to which the rules ensure environmental integrity and avoid double counting, while utilising the full potential of cooperative efforts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2019a">Michaelowa et al. 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schneider--2019">Schneider et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In relation to the criterion of <span class="•-Condensed-italic">institutional strength</span>, the Paris Agreement’s signalling and guidance function is, however, arguably high.

It may also be used by public-sector organisations – organised and mobilised in many countries and transnationally – as a point of leverage in domestic politics to encourage countries to take costly mitigation actions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keohane--2016">Keohane and Oppenheimer 2016</a>).

Such action could potentially ‘bridge’ the ambition gap created by insufficient NDCs from Parties (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hsu--2019b">Hsu et al. 2019b</a>). The 2018 UNEP Emissions Gap Report estimates that if ‘cooperative initiatives are scaled up to their fullest potential’, the impact of non-state and sub-national actors could be up to 1–23 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> by 2030 compared to current policy, which could bridge the gap (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lui--2021">Lui et al. 2021</a>).

Non-state actors are also playing a role in enhancing the ambition of individual NDCs by challenging their adequacy in national courts (<a class="section-link" data-title="National and sub-national policies and institutions" href="/chapters/chapter-13">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="section-link" data-title="Civil Society and Social Movements" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.3">Section 14.5.3</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The Paris Agreement’s institutional strength in terms of ‘rules and standards to facilitate collective action’ is disputed given the current lack of comparable information in NDCs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Peters--2017">Peters et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pauw--2018">Pauw et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mayer--2019">Mayer 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zihua--2019">Zihua et al. 2019</a>), and the extent to which its language, as well as that of the Rulebook, strikes a balance in favour of discretion over prescriptiveness (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2019">Rajamani and Bodansky 2019</a>). Similarly, in terms of ‘mechanisms to enhance transparency and accountability’, although detailed rules relating to transparency have been developed under the Paris Rulebook, these rules permit Parties considerable self-determination in the extent and manner of application (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rajamani--2019">Rajamani and Bodansky 2019</a>), and may not lead to further ambition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weikmans--2020">Weikmans et al. 2020</a>). Further the Paris Agreement’s compliance committee is facilitative and designed to ensure compliance with the procedural obligations in the Agreement rather than with the NDCs themselves, which are not subject to obligations of result. The Paris Agreement does, however, seek to support the building of transparency-related capacity of developing countries, potentially triggering institutional capacity-building at the national, sub-national and sectoral levels (<a class="section-link" data-title=" Cooperative Approaches" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.2.7">Section 14.3.2.7</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Ultimately, the overall effectiveness of the Paris Agreement depends on its ability to lead to ratcheting up of collective climate action to meet the long-term global temperature goal (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bang--2016">Bang et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Christoff--2016">Christoff 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Young--2016">Young 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dimitrov--2019">Dimitrov et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gupta--2019">Gupta and van Asselt 2019</a>). As noted above, there is some evidence that this is already occurring. The design of the Paris Agreement, with ‘nationally determined’ contributions at its centre, countenances an initial shortfall in collective ambition in relation to the long-term global temperature goal on the understanding and expectation that Parties will enhance the ambition of their NDCs over time (Article 4). This is essential given the current shortfall in ambition. The pathways reflecting current NDCs, according to various estimates, imply global warming in the range of 3°C by 2100 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016b">UNFCCC 2016b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2018a">UNEP 2018a</a>) (Box 4.3). NDCs will need to be substantially scaled up if the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement is to be met (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2016">Rogelj et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018">Rogelj et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6hne--2017">Höhne et al. 2017</a>, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2020">UNEP 2020</a>). The Paris Agreement’s ‘ambition cycle’ is designed to trigger such enhanced ambition over time. Some studies find that like-minded climate mitigation clubs can deliver substantial emissions reductions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hovi--2017">Hovi et al. 2017</a>) and are reasonably stable despite the departure of a major emitter such as the United States (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sprinz--2018">Sprinz et al. 2018</a>); other studies find that conditional commitments in the context of a pledge and review mechanism are unlikely to substantially increase countries’ contributions to emissions reductions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Helland--2017">Helland et al. 2017</a>), and hence need to be complemented by the adoption of instruments designed differently from the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--2016">Barrett and Dannenberg 2016</a>). In any case, high (but not perfect) levels of mean compliance rates with the Paris Agreement have to be assumed for reaching the ‘well below 2°C’ temperature goal (<a class="reference-link" href="#S%C3%A6len--2020">Sælen 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#S%C3%A6len--2020">Sælen et al. 2020</a>). This is by no means assured.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">In conclusion, it remains to be seen whether the Paris Agreement will deliver the collective ambition necessary to meet the temperature goal. While the Paris Agreement does not contain strong and stringent obligations of result for major emitters, backed by a demanding compliance system, it establishes binding procedural obligations, lays out a range of normative expectations, and creates mechanisms for regular review, stock taking, and revision of NDCs. In combination with complementary approaches to climate governance, engagement of a wide range of non-state and sub-national actors, and domestic enforcement mechanisms, these have the potential to deliver the necessary collective ambition and implementation. Whether it will do so, remains to be seen.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="Cross-Chapter Box 10 | Policy Attribution – Methodologies for Estimating the Macro-level Impact of Mitigation Policies on Indices of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation"><h2 class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"> Cross-Chapter Box 10 | Policy Attribution – Methodologies for Estimating the Macro-level Impact of Mitigation Policies on Indices of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-10-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Authors: </span>Mustafa Babiker (Sudan/Saudi Arabia), Paolo Bertoldi (Italy), Christopher Bataille (Canada), Felix Creutzig (Germany), Navroz K.

Such policies include regulatory instruments such as energy efficiency programmes or technical standards and codes, carbon pricing, financial support for low-carbon energy technologies and efficiency, voluntary agreements, and regulation of land-use practices.

Likewise, technological progress can result from both exogenous causes, such as ‘spillover’ from other sectors, and policy pressure. Further, other policies, such as fossil fuel subsidies as well as trade-related policies, can partially counteract the effect of mitigation policies by increasing the demand for energy or carbon-intensive goods and services.

As Chapters 2 and 6 of this report note that modern renewable energy sources currently satisfy over 9% of global electricity demand, and this is largely attributable to policy. There are no global-level studies estimating the avoided emissions due to renewable energy support policies, but there are methods that have been developed to link renewable energy penetration to avoided emissions, such as that of <a class="reference-link" href="#IRENA--2021">IRENA (2021)</a>.

The UNFCCC, in Article 4.1(c), calls on ‘all Parties’ to ‘promote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including transfer, of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases’ and places responsibility on developed country Parties to ‘take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--1992">UNFCCC 1992</a>, Art. 4.5). The issue of technology development and transfer has continued to receive much attention in the international climate policy domain since its initial inclusion in the UNFCCC in 1992 – albeit often overshadowed by dominant discourses around market-based mechanisms – and its role in reducing GHG emissions and adapting to the consequences of climate change ‘is seen as becoming ever more critical’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2015a">de Coninck and Sagar 2015a</a>). Milestones in the development of international cooperation on climate technologies under the UNFCCC have included: (i) the development of a technology transfer framework and establishment of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) under the SBSTA in 2001; (ii) recommendations for enhancing the technology transfer framework put forward at the Bali COP in 2007 and creation of the Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer under the GEF; and (iii) the establishment of the Technology Mechanism by the COP in 2010 as part of the Cancun Agreements (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2010b">UNFCCC 2010b</a>).

The TEC focuses on identifying and recommending policies that can support countries in enhancing and accelerating the development and transfer of climate technologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2020b">UNFCCC 2020b</a>).

Although not strictly a form of SRM, cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) has been proposed to cool the planet by increasing the escape of longwave thermal radiation to space and is included here for consistency with previous assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al. 2018</a>).

Recent modelling studies suggest it is conceptually possible to meet multiple climate objectives through optimally designed SRM strategies (WGI, Chapter 4). Nevertheless, large uncertainties still exist for climate processes associated with SRM options (e.g., aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction) (AR6 WGI, Chapter 4) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kravitz--2020">Kravitz and MacMartin 2020</a>).</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Compared with climate hazards, many fewer studies have examined SRM risks – the potential adverse consequences to people and ecosystems from the combination of climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability – or the potential for SRM to reduce risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Curry--2014">Curry et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Irvine--2017">Irvine et al. 2017</a>). Risk analyses have often used inputs from climate models forced with stylised representations of SRM, such as dimming the sun.

SAI will increase the fraction of diffuse sunlight, which is projected to increase photosynthesis in forested canopy, but will reduce the direct and total available sunlight, which tends to reduce photosynthesis. As total sunlight is reduced, there is a net reduction in crop photosynthesis with the result that any benefits to crops from avoided heat stress may be offset by reduced photosynthesis, as indicated by a single statistical modelling study (<a class="reference-link" href="#Proctor--2018">Proctor et al. 2018</a>).

To take one example, during the 1980s and 1990s a combination of bilateral development support and lending practices from multilateral development banks pushed developing countries to adopt power market reforms consistent with the Washington Consensus: towards liberalised power markets and away from state-owned monopolies. The goals of these reforms did not include an environmental component, and among the results was new investment in fossil-fired thermal power generation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Foster--2020">Foster and Rana 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As <a class="reference-link" href="#Goldthau--2010">Goldthau and Witte (2010)</a> document, the majority of governance efforts, outside of oil and gas producing states, was oriented towards ensuring reliable and affordable access for oil and gas imports. For example, the original rationale for the creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA), during the oil crisis of 1973–74, was to manage a mechanism to ensure importing countries’ access to oil (van de Graaf and Lesage 2009). On the other side of the aisle, oil exporting countries created the international institution OPEC to enable them to influence oil output, thereby stabilising prices and revenues for exporting countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fattouh--2013">Fattouh and Mahadeva 2013</a>). For years, energy governance was seen as a zero-sum game between these poles (<a class="reference-link" href="#Goldthau--2010">Goldthau and Witte 2010</a>).

Collectively, these developments may support the emergence of a nascent field of global sustainable energy governance, in which a broad range of global, regional, national, sub-national and non-state actors, in aggregate, shape, direct and implement the low carbon transition through climate change mitigation activities, which produce concomitant societal benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bruce--2018">Bruce 2018</a>). Beginning in the 1990s, for example, the IEA began to broaden its mission from one concerned primarily with security of oil supplies, which encompassed conservation of energy resources, to one also concerned with the sustainability of energy use, including work programmes on energy efficiency and clean energy technologies and scenarios (van de Graaf and Lesage 2009). Scholars have suggested that it was the widespread perception that the IEA was primarily interested in promoting the continued use of fossil fuels, and underplaying the potential role of renewable technologies, that led a number of IEA member states to successfully push for the creation of a parallel organisation, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which was then established in 2009 (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20de%20Graaf--2013">van de Graaf 2013</a>). An assessment of IRENA’s activities in 2015 suggested that the agency has a positive effect related to three core activities: offering advisory services to member states regarding renewable energy technologies and systems; serving as a focal point for data and analysis for renewable energy; and, mobilising other international institutions, such as multilateral development banks, promoting renewable energy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Urpelainen--2015">Urpelainen and Van de Graaf 2015</a>). The United Nations, including its various agencies such as the Committee on Sustainable Energy within the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, has also played a role in the realignment of global energy governance towards mitigation efforts. As a precursor to SDG 7, the United Nations initiated in 2011 the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, which in addition to aiming for universal access to modern energy services, included the goals of doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and doubling by 2030 the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bruce--2018">Bruce 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Sub-global agreements have also started to emerge, examples of issue-specific climate clubs.

For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Frisari--2015">Frisari and Stadelmann (2015)</a> find concessional lending by multilateral development banks to solar energy projects in Morocco and India to have reduced overall project costs, due to more attractive financing conditions from additional lenders, as well as reducing the costs to local governments. <a class="reference-link" href="#Labordena--2017">Labordena et al.

One aspect of this is the development of international legal norms. A large number of bilateral and multilateral agreements, including the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, include provisions for using a system of investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) designed to protect the interests of investors in energy projects from national policies that could lead their assets to be stranded. Numerous scholars have pointed to ISDS being able to be used by fossil-fuel companies to block national legislation aimed at phasing out the use of their assets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tienhaara--2018">Tienhaara 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bos--2019">Bos and Gupta 2019</a>).

Three statements, do however, appear to be robust. First, prior to the emergence of climate change on the global political agenda, international cooperation in the area of energy was primarily aimed at expanding and protecting the use of fossil energy, and these goals were entrenched in a number of multilateral organisations. Second, since the 1990s, international cooperation has gradually taken climate mitigation on board as one of its goals, seeing a realignment of many pre-existing organisations priorities, and the formation of a number of new international arrangements oriented towards the development of renewable energy resources. Third, the realignment is far from complete, and there are still examples of international cooperation having a chilling effect on climate mitigation, particularly through financing and investment practices, including legal norms designed to protect the interests of owners of fossil assets.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="14.5.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.5.2.3</span>Transportation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-30-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The transportation sector has been a particular focus of cooperative efforts on climate mitigation that extend beyond the sphere of the UNFCCC climate regime.

From 1 January 2019, the CORSIA SARPs require states and their operators to undertake an annual process of monitoring, verification, and reporting of emissions from all international flights, including to establish CORSIA’s emissions baseline (<a class="reference-link" href="#ICAO--2019">ICAO 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Based on this emissions data, CORSIA’s carbon offsetting obligations commenced in 2021, with three-year compliance cycles, including a pilot phase in 2021–2023.

However, it is unclear whether the goal of carbon neutral growth and further CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions reduction in the sector will be sufficiently incentivised solely through the use of such offsets in combination with ICAO’s manufacturing standards, programmes, and state action plans, without additional measures being taken, for example, constraints on demand (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lyle--2018">Lyle 2018</a>). If countries such as China, Brazil, India and Russia do not participate in CORSIA’s voluntary offsetting requirements this could significantly undermine its capacity to deliver fully on the sectoral goal by limiting coverage of the scheme to less than 50% of international aviation CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions in the period 2021–2026 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoch--2019">Hoch et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Climate%20Action%20Tracker--2020b">Climate Action Tracker 2020b</a>).

This includes a goal for declining carbon intensity of the sector by reducing CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, and pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#IMO--2018">IMO 2018</a>, Para. 3.1). The strategy also aims for peaking of total annual GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and a reduction by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels, while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out ‘as soon as possible in this century’ as a point ‘on a pathway of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions reduction consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IMO--2018">IMO 2018</a>, Para. 2, 3.1).

Fridays for Future is a children’s and youth movement that began in August 2018, inspired by the actions of then 15-year old Greta Thunberg who pledged to strike in front of the Swedish parliament every Friday to protest against a lack of action on climate change in line with the Paris Agreement targets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fridays%20for%20Future--2019">Fridays for Future 2019</a>). Fridays for Future events worldwide encompass more than 200 countries and millions of strikers.

Fridays for Future is regarded as a progressive resistance movement that has quickly achieved global prominence (for example, Thunberg was invited to address governments at the UN Climate Summit in New York in September 2019) and is credited with helping to support the discourse about the responsibility of humanity as a whole for climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Holmberg--2019">Holmberg and Alvinius 2019</a>). Whereas Fridays for Future has focused on periodic protest action, Extinction Rebellion has pursued a campaign based on sustained non-violent direct citizen action that is focused on three key demands: declaration of a ‘climate emergency’, acting now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, and creation of a citizen’s assembly on climate and ecological justice (<a class="reference-link" href="#Booth--2019">Booth 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Extinction%20Rebellion--2019">Extinction Rebellion 2019</a>).

Specific initiatives have also been taken to facilitate participation of particular groups, such as the UNFCCC’s Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, which commenced work in Katowice in 2019. Climate movements based in the Global South, as well as in indigenous territories, are playing an increasingly important role in transnational negotiations through networks such as the Indigenous Peoples Platform. These groups highlight the voices and perspectives of communities and peoples particularly affected by climate change.

The Framework draws on several approaches currently in use or under development in major forest governance-related processes and initiatives, including the World Bank’s Framework for Forest Governance Reform. The Framework builds on the understanding that governance is both the context and the product of the interaction of a range of actors and stakeholders with diverse interests (<a class="reference-link" href="#FAO--2010">FAO 2010</a>). For example, UNFCCC and the UN-REDD programme focus on REDD+ and UNEP focuses on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), institutional mechanisms that have been conceptualised as a ‘win-win-win’ for mitigating climate, protecting biodiversity and conserving indigenous culture by institutionalising payments on carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation values of ecosystems services from global to local communities. These mechanisms include public-private partnership, and NGO participation. REDD+ and TEEB allocation policies will be interventions in a highly complex system, and will inevitably involve trade-offs; therefore, it is important to question the ‘win-win-win’ discourse (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zia--2018">Zia and Kauffman 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Goulder--2019">Goulder et al. 2019</a>).

However, with the exception of the telecommunications sector, PPP investments have generally bypassed low-income countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ivanova--2017">Ivanova 2017</a>).

Examples of this line of reasoning are: poverty limits consumer spending, political instability disrupts business activity, and climate change threatens the production and distribution of goods and services. Such situations endanger multinational enterprise investments, global asset management funds, and the core business of international insurance companies and pension funds (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Tulder--2021">van Tulder et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A leading example is the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a global, CEO-led organisation of over 200 leading businesses working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. Member companies come from all business sectors and all major economies, representing a combined revenue of more than USD8.5 trillion and with 19 million employees. The WBCSD aims to enhance ‘the business case for sustainability through tools, services, models and experiences’. It includes a Global Network of almost 70 national business councils across the globe. The overall vision is to create a world where more than 9 billion people are all living well and within the boundaries of our planet, by 2050. Vision 2050, released in 2010, explored what a sustainable world would look like in 2050, how such a world could be realised, and the role that business can play in making that vision a reality. A few years later, Action2020 took that Vision and translated it into a roadmap of necessary business actions and solutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#WBCSD--2019">WBCSD 2019</a>). WBCSD focuses on those areas where business operates and can make an impact. They identify six transformation systems that are critical in this regard: Circular Economy, Climate and Energy, Cities and Mobility, Food and Nature, People and Redefining Value. All have an impact on climate. An important initiative launched in September 2008 –Natural Climate Solutions – has the objective of leveraging business investment to capture carbon out of the atmosphere. This initiative has built strong cross-sectoral partnerships and is intended to tap into this immense emissions reduction solution potential through natural methods with the help of private investment.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The Global Methane Initiative (GMI) is a multilateral partnership launched in 2004 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency along with 36 other countries to generate a voluntary, non-binding agenda for global collaboration to decrease anthropogenic methane releases. The GMI builds on the Methane to Markets (M2M) Partnership, an international partnership launched in 2004. In addition to the GMI’s own financial assistance, the initiative receives financial backing from the Global Methane Fund (GMF) for methane reduction projects. The GMF is a fund created by governments and private donors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leonard--2014">Leonard 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Another potentially influential type of transnational business partnership is investor coalitions or alliances formed for the purpose of pushing investee companies to adopt stronger measures for stranded asset management and climate change mitigation. MacLeod &amp; Park (2011, p. 55) argue that these transnational groups ‘attempt to re-orient and “regulate” the behaviour of business by holding corporations accountable via mechanisms of information sharing, monitoring of environmental impacts, and disclosure of activities related to the corporate climate footprint’. This favours a theory of active ownership (investor engagement with corporate boards) over capital divestment as the optimal pathway to shape the behaviour of corporate actors on climate risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kruitwagen--2017">Kruitwagen et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Krueger--2020">Krueger et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Transnational cooperative action by investors on climate mitigation has been facilitated by international standard-setting on issues of climate risk and disclosure. For example, in 2017 the Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) adopted international recommendations for climate risk disclosure (<a class="reference-link" href="#TCFD--2017">TCFD 2017</a>). These recommendations, which apply to all financial-sector organisations, including banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and asset owners, have received strong support from investor coalitions globally, including Climate Action 100+ (with 300 investors with more than USD33 trillion in assets under management), the Global Investor Coalition on Climate Change (a coalition of regional investor groups across Asia, Australia, Europe and North America) and the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC). One of the key recommendations of the TCFD calls for stress-testing of investment portfolios taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. Broad adoption of the TCFD recommendations could provide a basis for decisions by investors to shift assets away from climate-risk exposed assets such as fossil fuel extraction projects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Osofsky--2019">Osofsky et al. 2019</a>). There is strong evidence showing the urgent need for scaling-up climate finance to mitigate greenhouse gases in line with pursuit of limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and to support adaptation to safeguard the international community from the consequences of a changing climate. While public actors have a responsibility to deploy climate finance, it is clear that the contribution from the private sector needs to be significant (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gardiner--2016">Gardiner et al. 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As most of these partnerships are of recent vintage an assessment of their effectiveness is premature. Instead, partnerships can be assessed on the basis of the three main functions introduced earlier. Starting with policy development, that is, establishing new agreements on norms, rules, or standards among a broader set of governmental and non-governmental actors, this is not the most prominent aspect of partnerships so far, although both the cities’ networks and risk disclosure recommendations include some elements of this. The second element, enabling implementation and delivery of services, by combining resources from governmental and non-governmental actors, seems to be a more prominent part of the partnerships (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ivanova--2020">Ivanova et al. 2020</a>). Both UNEP financing, the WBCSD, the REDD+ and TEEB mechanisms, and PPP funding for cities are examples here. Finally, the third element, knowledge production and dissemination, for example, contributing to the evolution of relevant public policies, is the most prominent part of these partnerships, with the majority including such activities.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There is a relatively large volume of literature that assesses PPPs in general. Much of this applies to partnerships which, either by design or not, advance climate goals. This literature provides a good starting point for assessing these partnerships as they become operational. These can help assess whether such partnerships are worth the effort in terms of their performance and effectiveness (<a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2017b">Liu et al. 2017b</a>), their economic and social value added (<a class="reference-link" href="#Qu%C3%A9lin--2017">Quélin et al. 2017</a>), their efficiency (<a class="reference-link" href="#Estache--2014">Estache and Saussier 2014</a>) and the possible risks associated with them (Grimsey and Mervyn 2002).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">What is less common, but gradually growing, is an important and more relevant literature on criteria to assess sustainability and impact on climate and development goals. <a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2017">Michaelowa and Michaelowa (2017)</a> assess 109 transnational partnerships and alliances based on four design criteria: existence of mitigation targets; incentives for mitigation; definition of a baseline; and existence of a monitoring, reporting, and verification procedure . About half of the initiatives do not meet any of these criteria, and not even 15% satisfy three or more. A recent study using a systematic review of business and public administration literature on PPPs concludes that research in the past rarely incorporated sustainability concepts. The authors propose a research agenda and a series of success factors that, if appropriately managed, can contribute to sustainable development, and in so doing contribute to a more solid scientific evaluation of PPPs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pinz--2018">Pinz et al. 2018</a>). There is evidence that with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, many of which are directly linked to climate goals, PPPs will become even more prominent as they will be called upon to provide resources, knowledge, expertise, and implementation support in a very ambitious agenda. PPPs in the developing world need to take into account different cultural and social decision-making processes, language differences, and unfamiliar bureaucracy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gardiner--2016">Gardiner et al. 2016</a>). Having more evidence on what norms and standards in relation to sustainability are used and their governance is essential (<a class="reference-link" href="#Axel--2019">Axel 2019</a>). The issue of double counting should be revised. GHGs are accounted both at the national and sub-national level or company level (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schneider--2014">Schneider et al. 2014</a>). Some recent studies aim to provide systems to assess the impact of PPPs beyond the much-used notion of value for money. One of these recent studies proposes a conceptual model that addresses six dimensions relevant to economic, social and environmental progress. These include resilience and environment, access of services to the population, scalability and replicability, economic impact, inclusiveness, and finally, degree of engagement of stakeholders (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrone--2019">Berrone et al. 2019</a>).

There are several ways they can be useful. First, sub-national governments can contribute insights and experience that provide valuable lessons to national governments, as well as offering needed implementation capacity (<a class="reference-link" href="#GIZ--2017">GIZ 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Leffel--2018">Leffel 2018</a>). A great deal of policymaking has occurred at the level of city governments in particular. Cities have been responsible for more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions and generate over 80% of global income (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2010">World Bank 2010</a>), and many of them have started to take their own initiative in enacting and developing mitigation policies (CDP 2015). Most of these activities aim at the reduction of GHG emissions in the sectors of energy, transportation, urban land use and waste (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bulkeley--2010">Bulkeley 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xuemei--2007">Xuemei 2007</a>), and are motivated by concerns not only over climate, but also a consideration of local co-benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rashidi--2017">Rashidi et al. 2017</a>, 2019). Second, sub-national governments can fill the void in policy leadership in cases where national governments are ineffectual, even to the point of claiming leadership and authority with respect to foreign affairs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leffel--2018">Leffel 2018</a>). International cooperation plays a role in such action. Several international networks, such as C40, ICLEI, Mayors for Climate Protection, and the Covenant of Mayors have played an important role in defining and developing climate-policy initiatives at the city level (<a class="reference-link" href="#F%C3%BCnfgeld--2015">Fünfgeld 2015</a>). While the networks differ from each other, they generally are voluntary and non-hierarchical, intended to support the horizontal diffusion of innovative climate policies through information-sharing platforms linked to specific goals that member cities make (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2009">Kern and Bulkeley 2009</a>). The literature has addressed the questions of why cities join the networks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Betsill--2004">Betsill and Bulkeley 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pitt--2010">Pitt 2010</a>), what recognition benefits cities can expect (<a class="reference-link" href="#Buis--2009">Buis 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2009">Kern and Bulkeley 2009</a>), and how memberships can provide visibility to leverage international funding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Betsill--2004">Betsill and Bulkeley 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Heinrichs--2013">Heinrichs et al. 2013</a>). Membership in the networks has been found to be a significant predictor of cities’ adoption of mitigation policies, even when controlling for national-level policies that may be in place (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rashidi--2018">Rashidi and Patt 2018</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Kona--2018">Kona et al.

(2021)</a> document this trend continuing.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">With respect to their role in formal international cooperation, however, it is unclear what authority, as a non-state actor, they actually have. Cities, for example, are members of transnational initiatives aimed at non-state actors, such as Global Climate Action, originally the Non-state Actor Zone for Climate Action, under the UNFCCC. While there is reason to believe that such membership can add value to mitigation efforts, one study suggests that the environmental effects have yet to be reliably quantified (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hsu--2019a">Hsu et al. 2019a</a>). By contrast, <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuramochi--2020">Kuramochi et al.

In terms of institutional strength, <a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2017">Michaelowa and Michaelowa (2017)</a> suggest that few such networks fulfil governance criteria, and hence challenge their effectiveness. Several researchers suggest that their role is important in informal ways, given issues about the legitimacy of non-state actors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2016">Chan et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nasiritousi--2016">Nasiritousi et al. 2016</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#B%C3%A4ckstrand--2017">Bäckstrand et al. (2017)</a> advance the concept of ‘hybrid multilateralism’ as a heuristic to capture this intensified interplay between state and non-state actors in the new landscape of international climate cooperation. The effectiveness of such non-state government actors should be measured not only by their contribution to mitigation, but also by their success to enhance the accountability, transparency and deliberative quality of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2015">Chan et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Busby--2016">Busby 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hale--2016">Hale et al. 2016</a>).

Most <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ex-post </span> assessments of the Kyoto Protocol suggest that it did lead to emissions reductions in countries with binding targets, in addition to changing investment patterns in low-carbon technologies. As noted earlier, the Paris Agreement is tailored to the evolving understanding of the climate mitigation challenge as well as shifting political imperatives and constraints. Whether the Paris Agreement will in fact be effective in supporting global action sufficient to achieve its objectives is contested, with competing arguments in the scientific literature supporting different views. To some extent these views align with the different analytic frameworks (<a class="section-link" data-title="Framing Concepts for Assessment " href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.2.1">Section 14.2.1</a>): the Paris Agreement does not address the free-riding issue seen as important within the global commons framing, but may provide the necessary incentives and support mechanisms viewed as important under the political and transitions framings, respectively. The strongest critique of the Paris Agreement is that current NDCs themselves fail by a wide margin to add up to the level of aggregate emissions reductions necessary to achieve the objectives of holding global average warming well below 2°C, much less 1.5°C (<a class="section-link" data-title="Effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol " href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.3">Section 14.3.3</a> Figure 14.2), and that there is no legally binding obligation to achieve the NDCs. Arguments in support of Paris are that it puts in place the processes, and generates normative expectations, that nudge NDCs to become progressively more ambitious over time, including in developing countries. The growing number of countries with mid-century net-zero GHG or CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> targets, consistent with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, lends support to this proposition, although there is as yet no empirical literature drawing an unambiguous connection. The collective quantified goal from a floor of USD100 billion a year in transfers to developing countries, the Green Climate Fund and other provisions on finance in the Paris Agreement have also been recognised as key to cooperation (Sections 14.3.2.8 and 14.4.1). But then these arguments are met with counter arguments, that even with Paris processes in place, given the logic of iterative, rising levels of ambition over time, this is unlikely to happen within the narrow window of opportunity that exists to avert dangerous levels of global warming (<a class="section-link" data-title="Effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol " href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.3.3">Section 14.3.3</a>). The degree to which countries are willing to increase the ambition and secure the achievement of their NDCs over time will be an important indicator of the success of the Paris Agreement; evidence of this was expected by the end of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the process of updating NDCs.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">An increasing role is also played by other cooperative agreements, in particular (potentially) under Article 6 (Sections 14.3.2.10 and 14.4.4), transnational partnerships, and the institutions that support them. This fits both a transitions narrative that cooperation at the sub-global and sectoral levels is necessary to enable specific system transformations, and a recent emphasis in the public goods literature on club goods and a gradual approach to cooperation, also referred to as building blocks or incremental approach (Sections 14.2 and 14.5.1.4). There has been little analysis of whether these other agreements are of sufficient scale and scope to ensure that transformations happen quickly enough. This chapter, appraising them together, concludes that they are not. First, many agreements, such as those related to trade, may stand in the way of bottom-up mitigation efforts (<a class="section-link" data-title="Trade Agreements" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.1.3">Section 14.5.1.3</a>). Second, many sectoral agreements aimed at decarbonisation – such as within the air travel sector – have not yet adopted targets comparable in scale, scope or legal character to those adopted under the Paris Agreement (<a class="section-link" data-title="Transportation" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.2.3">Section 14.5.2.3</a>). Third, there are many sectors for which there are no agreements in place. At the same time, there are some important bright spots, many in the area of transnational partnerships. A growing number of cities have committed themselves to adopting urban policies that will place them on a path to rapid decarbonisation, while learning from each other how to implement successful policies to realise climate goals (<a class="section-link" data-title="International Cooperation at the Sub-national and City Levels" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.5">Section 14.5.5</a>). An increasing number of large corporations have committed to decarbonising their industrial processes and supply chains (<a class="section-link" data-title="Transnational Business and Public-Private Partnerships and Initiatives" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.4">Section 14.5.4</a>). And an ever-increasing number of non-state actors are adopting goals and initiating mitigation actions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Civil Society and Social Movements" href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.5.3">Section 14.5.3</a>). These goals and actions, some argue, could bridge the mitigation gap created by inadequate NDCs, although the empirical literature to date challenges this, suggesting that there is less transparency and limited accountability for such actions, and mitigation targets and incentives are also not clear (Sections 14.3.3 and 14.5).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="14.6.2"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">14.6.2</span>Overall Assessment of International Cooperation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section provides an overall assessment of international cooperation, taking into account the combined effects of cooperation within the UNFCCC process, other global agreements, as well as regional, sectoral, and transnational processes. Recent literature consistent with the transitions framing highlights that cooperation can be particularly effective when it addresses issues on a sector-by-sector basis (Geels et al. 2019). Table 14.4 below summarises the effects of international cooperation on mitigation efforts in each of the sectoral areas covered in Chapters 5 to 12 of this report. As it indicates, there are some strong areas of sector-specific cooperation, but also some important weaknesses. Formal agreements and programmes, both multilateral and bilateral, are advancing mitigation efforts in energy, AFOLU, and transportation, while transnational networks and partnerships are addressing issues in urban systems, industry, and buildings. Although many of the concerns relevant for buildings may be embedded in the energy sector with respect to their operation, and the industrial sector with respect to their materials, reinforcing the networks with more formal agreements could be vital to putting these sectors on a pathway to net zero GHG or CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions. Several of the sectors have very little formal cooperation at the international level, and a common theme across many of them is a need for increased financial flows to achieve particular objectives.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Table 14.5 provides examples of mechanisms addressing each of the assessment criteria identified in <a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment Criteria " href="/chapters/chapter-14#14.2.3">Section 14.2.3</a>. The effects of different forms of international cooperation are separated out, including not only UNFCCC and other multilateral processes, but also sub-global and sectoral agreements. Several points stand out. First, the Paris Agreement has the potential to significantly advance the UN climate regime’s transformative potential. Second, the international market mechanisms under Article 6 – should an agreement on implementation deals be reached – allow a shift from projects and programmes to policy-based and sectoral generation of emissions credits. Moreover, the sectoral agreement CORSIA also makes use of such credits. Third, there is a lack of attention to both distributive outcomes and institutional support within sectoral agreements, representing a serious gap in efforts to harmonise mitigation with equity and sustainable development. Fourth, there are transnational partnerships and initiatives, representing the actions of non-state actors, addressing each of the assessment criteria, with the exception of economic effectiveness.</p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table 14.4 | Effects of international cooperation on sectoral mitigation efforts. </span></span></p><table class="IPCC-Table" id="table006"><colgroup><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-33"><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-34"><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-35"></colgroup><thead><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-11"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue-" lang="en-US">Sector</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue-" lang="en-US">Key strengths</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue-" lang="en-US">Key gaps and weaknesses</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Subhead-row--white- CellOverride-2"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Demand, services, social aspects</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Body-row CellOverride-2"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Adoption of SDGs addressing social inequities and sustainable development in the context of mitigation</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Body-row CellOverride-2"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Little international attention to demand-side mitigation issues</p></td></tr><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-19"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Subhead-row--white- CellOverride-3"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Energy</p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Body-row CellOverride-2"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US">Greater incorporation of climate goals into sectoral agreements and institutions;

There is little in the way of cross-sectional variance, given that most of the governance mechanisms assessed here are global in their geographical coverage. One exception is with respect to the effects of the Kyoto Protocol, which we have reported. Time series analysis is also challenging, given that other determinants of climate mitigation, including technology costs and the effects of national and sub-national level policies, are rapidly evolving. Thus, this chapter primarily reviews scholarship that compares observations with theory-based counterfactual scenarios.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Many of the international agreements and institutions discussed in this chapter, in particular the Paris Agreement, are new. The logic and architecture of the Paris Agreement, in particular, breaks new ground, and there is limited evaluation of prior experience in the form of analogous treaties to draw on. Such instruments have evolved in response to geopolitical and other drivers that are changing rapidly, and will continue to shape the nature of international cooperation under it and triggered by it. The Paris Agreement is also, in common with other multilateral agreements, a ‘living instrument’ evolving through interpretative and operationalising rules, and forms of implementation, that Parties continue to negotiate at conferences year on year. It is a constant ‘work in progress’ and thus challenging to assess at any given point in time. The Paris Agreement also engages a larger set of variables – given its privileging of national autonomy and politics, integration with the sustainable development agenda, and its engagement with actions and actors at multiple levels – than earlier international agreements, which further complicates the task of tracing causality between observed effects and international cooperation through the Paris Agreement.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Understanding of the effectiveness of international agreements and institutions is driven entirely by theory-driven prediction of how the world will evolve, both with these agreements in place and without them. The predictions in particular are problematic, because governance regimes are complex adaptive systems, making it impossible to predict how they will evolve over time, and hence what their effects will be. Time will cure this in part, as it will generate observations of the world with the new regime in place, which we can compare to the counterfactual situation of the new regime’s being absent, which may be a simpler situation to model. But even here our modelling capacity is limited: it may simply never be possible to know with a high degree of confidence whether international cooperation, such as that embodied in the Paris Agreement, is having a significant effect, no matter how much data are accumulated.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Given the importance of theory for guiding assessments of the past and likely future impacts of policies, it is important to note that among the alternative theoretical frameworks for analysis, some have been much more extensively developed in the literature than others. This chapter has noted in particular the partial dichotomy between a global commons framing of climate change and a transitions framing, which include different indicators to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of policies. The latter framing is particularly under-developed. Greater development of theories resting in social science disciplines such as economic geography, sociology, and psychology could potentially provide a more complete picture of the nature and effectiveness of international cooperation.</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-heading" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 14.1 | 	Is international cooperation working?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 14.1 | Is international cooperation working?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-25-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Yes, to an extent. Countries’ emissions were in line with their internationally agreed targets: the collective greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation target for Annex I countries in the UNFCCC to return to their 1990 emissions levels by 2000, and their individual targets in the Kyoto Protocol for 2008–12. Numerous studies suggest that participation in the Kyoto Protocol led to substantial reductions in national GHG emissions, as well increased levels of innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies. In this latter respect, the Kyoto Protocol set in motion some of the transformational changes that will be required to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. It is too soon to tell whether the processes and commitments embodied in the Paris Agreement will be effective in achieving its stated goals with respect to limiting temperature rise, adaptation, and financial flows. There is, however, evidence that its entry into force has been a contributing factor to many countries’ adopting mid-century targets of net-zero GHG or CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span> emissions.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 14.2 |	What is the future role of international cooperation in the context "><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 14.2 | What is the future role of international cooperation in the context of the Paris Agreement?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-26-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Continued international cooperation remains critically important both to stimulate countries’ enhanced levels of mitigation ambition, and through various means of support to increase the likelihood that they achieve these objectives. The latter is particularly the case in developing countries, where mitigation efforts often rely on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on low-carbon finance, technology support, capacity building, and enhanced South-South cooperation. The Paris Agreement is structured around Nationally Determined Contributions that are subject to an international oversight system, and bolstered through international support. The international oversight system is designed to generate transparency and accountability for individual emissions reduction contributions, and regular moments for stock-taking of these efforts towards global goals. Such enhanced transparency may instil confidence and trust, and foster solidarity among nations, with theory-based arguments that this will lead to greater levels of ambition. Together with other cooperative agreements at the sub-global and sectoral levels, as well as a growing number of transnational networks and initiatives, the implementation of all of these mechanisms is likely to play an important role in making political, economic, and social conditions more favourable to ambitious mitigation efforts in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 14.3 | 	Are there any important gaps in international cooperation, which will need to be filled in order for countries to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, such as holding temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 14.3 | Are there any important gaps in international cooperation, which will need to be filled in order for countries to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, such as holding temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-27-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">While international cooperation is contributing to global mitigation efforts, its effects are far from uniform. Cooperation has contributed to setting a global direction of travel, and to falling greenhouse gas emissions in many countries and avoided emissions in others. It remains to be seen whether it can achieve the kind of transformational changes needed to achieve the Paris Agreement’s long-term global goals. There appears to be a large potential role for international cooperation to better address sector-specific technical and infrastructure challenges that are associated with such transformational changes. Finalising the rules to pursue voluntary cooperation, such as through international carbon market mechanisms and public climate finance in the implementation of NDCs, without compromising environmental integrity, may play an important role in accelerating mitigation efforts in developing countries. Finally, there is room for international cooperation to more explicitly address transboundary issues associated with carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">References</span></h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-10-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Aakre--2018" lang="en-GB">Aakre, S., S.
