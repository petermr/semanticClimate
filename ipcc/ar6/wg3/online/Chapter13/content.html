Given the scale and scope of the climate challenge, an immediate challenge for this assessment is defining its scope. Because a very wide range of institutions and policies at multiple scales carry implications for climate change, the approach followed here is to embrace a broad approach. Consequently, institutions and policies discussed include dedicated climate laws and organisations (<a class="section-link" data-title="National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2">Section 13.2</a>) and direct mitigation policies such as carbon taxes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Policy Instruments and Evaluation " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.6">Section 13.6</a>), but also those, such as sectoral ministries and their policies (Sections 13.6 and 13.7) and sub-national entities such as regional bodies, cities, and their policies (<a class="section-link" data-title="Sub-national Actors, Networks, and Partnerships" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.5">Section 13.5</a>), the implications of which are salient to mitigation outcomes. This approach recognises that there are important linkages with international climate governance (Chapter 14), notably the role of internationally mandated Nationally Determined Contributions’ in stimulating domestic policy development (<a class="section-link" data-title="National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2">Section 13.2</a>), transnational networks in spurring sub-national action (<a class="section-link" data-title="Sub-national Actors, Networks, and Partnerships" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.5">Section 13.5</a>), and international effects of domestic policies (<a class="section-link" data-title="Policy Instruments and Evaluation " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.6">Section 13.6</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This encompassing approach to climate governance is also built on a recognition that climate policymaking is routinely formulated in the context of multiple policy objectives such as energy security, energy access, urban development, and mitigation-adaptation linkages. This informs policymaking based on an understanding that to fully maximise direct and indirect climate mitigation potential, maximising co-benefits and minimising trade-offs should be explicitly sought rather than accidentally discovered and policies designed accordingly. This understanding also informs the design of institutions (<a class="section-link" data-title="National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2">Section 13.2</a>) and policies (Sections 13.6 and 13.7) as well as the linkage between mitigation and adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Integrating Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.8">Section 13.8</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The chapter also engages with several new developments and an expansion of the literature since AR5.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A growing literature assesses how national policymaking on climate mitigation is dependent on national politics around, and building consensus on, climate action. This, in turn, is shaped by both nationally specific structural features (<a class="section-link" data-title="Structural Factors that Shape Climate Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.3">Section 13.3</a>) and the role of different actors in the policymaking process (<a class="section-link" data-title="Actors Shaping Climate Governance " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.4">Section 13.4</a>). Important new avenues through which climate policy making is shaped, such as climate litigation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Shaping Climate Governance Through Litigation" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.4.2">Section 13.4.2</a>), and channels for public opinion formation, such as the media (<a class="section-link" data-title="Media as Communicative Platforms for Shaping Climate Governance " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.4.3">Section 13.4.3</a>) are also assessed. The chapter weaves discussions of the role of justice, understood through a discussion of procedural justice (<a class="section-link" data-title="National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2">Section 13.2</a>), distributional justice (<a class="section-link" data-title="Policy Instruments and Evaluation " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.6">Section 13.6</a>) and vulnerability (<a class="section-link" data-title="Integrating Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.8">Section 13.8</a>), and its role in creating public support for climate action (<a class="section-link" data-title="Accelerating Mitigation Through " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.9">Section 13.9</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A significant new theme is the focus on the dynamic elements of policy making, that is, how policy can be designed to accelerate mitigation. This includes through technological transitions, socio-technical transitions, shifts in development pathways and economy-wide measures. This literature emphasises the importance of examining not just individual policies, but packages of policies (<a class="section-link" data-title="Integrated Policy Packages for Mitigation and Multiple Objectives " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.7">Section 13.7</a>) and how these are enabled by the alignment of policy, institutions, finance, behaviour and innovation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Accelerating Mitigation Through " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.9">Section 13.9</a>). Also new is attention to the opportunities for economy-wide system change presented by consideration of post-COVID recovery packages, and wider efforts at sustainable economic restructuring (<a class="section-link" data-title="Accelerating Mitigation Through " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.9">Section 13.9</a>). Consistent with the discussion in Chapter 4, these larger approaches offer opportunities to undertake systemic restructuring and shift development pathways.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Finally, the chapter addresses core themes from earlier assessment reports, but seeks to do so in an enhanced manner. The discussion of climate institutions assesses a growing literature on climate law, as well as both purpose-built climate organisations and the layering of climate responsibilities on existing organisations at national and sub-national scales (<a class="section-link" data-title="National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2">Section 13.2</a>). The discussion of policies focuses on an <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ex post </span> assessment of policies, as well as the interaction among them, and learnings on how they can be combined in packages (Sections 13.6 and 13.7). It also lays out a framework for their assessment that encompasses environmental effectiveness, economic effectiveness, distributional outcomes, co-benefits, institutional requirements, as well as a new criterion of transformational potential (<a class="section-link" data-title="Policy Instruments and Evaluation " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.6">Section 13.6</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The aim of this chapter is to assess the full range of the multi-stranded and diverse literature on climate institutions and policy, reflecting the richness of real-world climate governance.</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="13.2"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">13.2</span>National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-3-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Institutions and governance arrangements can help address ‘policy gaps’ and ‘implementation gaps’ (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4) that hinder climate mitigation. While the need for institutions and governance is universal, individual country approaches vary, based on national approaches and circumstances, as discussed in this section.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, the understanding of climate governance has become more encompassing and complex, involving multiple actors, decision-making arenas, levels of decision-making and a variety of political goals. Climate governance sometime directly targets GHG emissions; at other times mitigation results from measures that primarily aim to solve other issues, for instance relating to food production, forest management, energy markets, air pollution, transport systems or technology development, but with mitigation or adaptation effects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karlsson--2020">Karlsson et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Consistent with usage in this assessment, institutions are rules, norms and conventions that guide, constrain or enable behaviours and practices, including the organisations through which they operate, while governance is the structure, processes and actions that public and private actors use to address societal goals (See Glossary for complete definitions). Multiple terms are used in the literature to discuss climate governance, often varying across countries. Climate laws, or legislation, is passed by legislatures, and often sets the overarching governance context, but the term is also used to refer to legislation that is salient to climate outcomes even if not centrally focused on climate change. National strategies, often referred to as plans, most often operate through executive action by government, set guidance for action and often are not legally binding, although strategies may also be enshrined in law. Both laws and strategies may elaborate targets, or goals, for emissions outcomes, although these are not necessary components of laws and strategies. While laws typically operate at the national level (states may also make laws in federal nations), strategies, plans and targets may also operate at the sub-national level.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section begins with a discussion of national laws for climate action (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Laws" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2.1">Section 13.2.1</a>), followed by a discussion of national strategies (<a class="section-link" data-title="National Strategies and Nationally Determined Contributions" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2.2">Section 13.2.2</a>). The third section examines institutions (Section13.2.3), including organisations that are established to govern climate actions, and the final section explores sub-national institutions and their challenges in influencing climate mitigation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Institution Building at the Sub-national Level" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2.4">Section 13.2.4</a>).</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="13.2.1"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">13.2.1</span>Climate Laws <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-1-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">National laws that govern climate action often set the legal basis for climate action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Averchenkova--2021">Averchenkova et al. 2021</a>). This legal basis can serve several functions: establish a platform for transparent target setting and implementation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bennett--2018">Bennett 2018</a>); provide a signal to actors by indicating intent to harness state authority behind climate action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scotford--2019">Scotford and Minas 2019</a>); promise enhanced regulatory certainty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scotford--2017">Scotford et al. 2017</a>); create law-backed agencies for coordination, compliance and accountability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scotford--2019">Scotford and Minas 2019</a>); provide a basis for mainstreaming mitigation into sector action, and create focal points for social mobilisation (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement </span>)<span class="•-Condensed-italic"></span> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2013">Dubash et al. 2013</a>). For lower/middle income countries, in particular, the existence of a law may also attract international finance by serving as a signal of credibility (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fisher--2017">Fisher et al. 2017</a>). The realisation of these potential governance gains depends on local context, legal design, successful implementation, and complementary action at different scales.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There are both narrow and broad definitions of what counts as ‘climate laws’. The literature distinguishes direct climate laws that explicitly considers climate change causes or impacts – for example through mention of greenhouse gas reductions in its objectives or title (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2013">Dubash et al. 2013</a>) – from indirect laws that have ‘the capacity to affect mitigation or adaptation’ through the subjects they regulate, for example, through promotion of co-benefits, or creation of reporting protocols (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scotford--2019">Scotford and Minas 2019</a>). Closely related is a ‘sectoral approach’ based on the layering of climate considerations into existing laws in the absence of an overarching framework law (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rumble--2019">Rumble 2019</a>). Many countries also adopt executive climate strategies (discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="National and Sub-national Institutions and Governance" href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.2">Section 13.2</a>), which may either coexist with or substitute for climate laws, and that may also be related to a country’s NDC process under the Paris Agreement.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The prevalence of both direct and indirect climate laws has increased considerably since 2007, although definitional differences across studies complicate a clear assessment of their relative importance (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Iacobuta--2018">Iacobuta et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nachmany--2018">Nachmany and Setzer 2018</a>). Direct climate laws – with greenhouse gas limitation as a direct objective – had been passed in 56 countries (of 194 studied) covering 53% of emissions in 2020, with most of that rise happening between 2010 and 2015 (Figure 13.1). Both direct and indirect laws – those that have an effect on mitigation even if this is not the primary outcome – is most closely captured by the ‘Climate Change Laws of the World’ database, which illustrates the same trend of growing prevalence, documenting 694 mitigation-related laws by 2020 versus 558 in 2015 and 342 in 2010 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nachmany--2018">Nachmany and Setzer 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#LSE%20Grantham%20Research%20Institute%20on%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Environment--2021">LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment 2021</a>). <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch13.html#footnote-004">1</a> </span></span>Among these, the majority are accounted for by sectoral indirect laws. For example, a study of Commonwealth countries finds that a majority of these countries have not taken the route of a single overarching law, but rather have an array of laws across different areas, for example, Indian laws on energy efficiency and Ghana’s laws on renewable energy promotion (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scotford--2017">Scotford et al. 2017</a>).</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer005"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="figure-13-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_13_1.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 13.1 | Prevalence of legislation by emissions and number of countries across regions. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Top: </span> Shares of global GHG emissions under national climate change legislations – in 2010, 2015 and 2020.

Framework laws are intended to provide a coherent legal basis for action, to integrate past legislation in related areas, set clear directions for future policy, and create necessary processes and institutions (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Townshend--2013">Townshend et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Averchenkova--2017">Averchenkova et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2018">Fankhauser et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rumble--2019">Rumble 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Averchenkova--2021">Averchenkova et al. 2021</a>). There are a variety of approaches to framework laws. Reviews of climate legislation, many of which draw particularly from the long-standing UK Climate Change Act, suggest the need for statutory targets with a long-term direction, shorter term instruments such as carbon budgets to induce action toward targets, a clear assignment of duties and responsibilities including identification of policies and responsibility for their implementation, annual reporting to Parliament; an independent body to support evidence-based decision-making and rules to govern information collection and provision (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barton--2018">Barton and Campion 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2018">Fankhauser et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Abraham-Dukuma--2020">Abraham-Dukuma et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Averchenkova--2021">Averchenkova et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, country examples also suggest other, different approaches to framework laws. Korea’s Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth seeks to shift business and society toward green growth through a process of strategy setting and action plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jang--2010">Jang et al. 2010</a>). Kenya’s framework Climate Change Act creates an institutional structure to mainstream climate considerations into sectoral decisions, one of several examples across Africa of efforts to create framework legislation to promote mainstreaming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rumble--2019">Rumble 2019</a>). Mexico’s General Law on Climate Change includes sectoral emission targets, along with the creation of coordinating institutions across ministries and sub-national authorities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Averchenkova--2018">Averchenkova and Guzman Luna 2018</a>). Consequently, different countries have placed emphasis on different aspects of framework laws, although the most widely prevalent approach is that exemplified by the UK.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Climate laws spread through multiple mechanisms, including the impetus provided by international negotiation events, diffusion by example across countries, and domestic factors such as business cycles (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium agreement </span>). Major landmark events under the UNFCCC have been associated with increases in national legislation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Iacobuta--2018">Iacobuta et al. 2018</a>), with a stronger effect in countries where international commitments are binding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2016">Fankhauser et al. 2016</a>).

The presence of a framework law is positively associated with creation of additional supportive legislation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2015">Fankhauser et al. 2015</a>). Domestic contextual factors can also affect the likelihood of legislation such as a weak business cycle that can impact the political willingness to pass legislation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2015">Fankhauser et al. 2015</a>). In some cases, civil society groups play a role as advocates for legislation, as occurred in the UK (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lockwood--2013">Lockwood 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lorenzoni--2014">Lorenzoni and Benson 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2018">Carter and Childs 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Devaney--2020">Devaney et al. 2020</a>) and in Germany in the build up to passage of their respective Climate Change Act (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flachsland--2021">Flachsland and Levi 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The performance of framework laws suggests a mixed picture.

National climate institutions take diverse forms because they emerge out of country-specific interactions between national climate politics and existing institutional structures. Certain institutional forms tend to be common across countries, such as expert climate change commissions; a review finds eleven such institutions in existence as of mid-2020. Although this institutional form may be common, these commissions vary in terms of expertise, independence and focus (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abraham-Dukuma--2020">Abraham-Dukuma et al. 2020</a>), reinforcing the important shaping role of national context.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A review of institutions in eight countries suggests three broad processes through which institutions emerge: ‘purpose-built’ dedicated institutions focused explicitly on mitigation; ‘layering’ of mitigation objectives on existing institutions; and ‘latent’ institutions created for other purposes that nonetheless have implications for mitigation outcomes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2021">Dubash 2021</a>). In relatively few countries do new, purpose-built, legally-mandated bodies created specifically for climate mitigation exist although this number is growing; examples include the UK (<a class="reference-link" href="#Averchenkova--2018">Averchenkova et al. 2018</a>), China (<a class="reference-link" href="#Teng--2021">Teng and Wang 2021</a>), Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keenan--2012">Keenan et al. 2012</a>) and New Zealand (<a class="reference-link" href="#Timperley--2020">Timperley 2020</a>). These cases indicate that dedicated and lasting institutions with a strategic long-term focus on mitigation emerge only under conditions of broad national political agreement around climate mitigation as a national priority (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2021">Dubash 2021</a>). However, the specific forms of those institutions differ, as illustrated by the case of the UK’s Climate Change Committee established as an independent agency (Box 13.2) and China, which is built around a top-down planning structure (Box 13.3).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Where economy-wide institutions do not exist, new institutions may still address sub-sets of the challenge. In Australia, while political conditions resulted in the repeal of an overarching Clean Energy Act in 2014, although a Climate Change Authority continued, other institutions primarily focused on the energy sector such as the Clean Energy Regulator, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the Australia Renewable Agency continued to shape energy outcomes (<a class="reference-link" href="#MacNeil--2021">MacNeil 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Where new dedicated organisations have not emerged, countries may layer climate responsibilities on existing institutions; the addition of mitigation to the responsibilities of the US Environmental Protection Agency is an example (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mildenberger--2021">Mildenberger 2021</a>). Layering is also a common approach when climate change is embedded within consideration of multiple objectives of policy. In these cases, climate institutions tend to be layered on sectoral institutions for the pursuit of co-benefits or broader development concerns. Examples include India, where energy security was an important objective of renewable energy promotion policy (Pillai and <a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2021">Dubash 2021</a>), Brazil’s mitigation approach focused on sectoral forest policy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hochstetler--2021">Hochstetler 2021</a>) and South Africa’s emphasis on job creation as a necessary factor in mitigation policy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chandrashekeran--2017">Chandrashekeran et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rennkamp--2019">Rennkamp 2019</a>).

The value of these resources depends on demand for the fuel and competing supplies in the relevant international markets.

A single policy in one country is unlikely to have a noticeable effect on the international price, but similar policies in multiple countries could adversely affect the value of the resources.

First, there is growing recognition that mitigation policy occurs in the context of multiple climate and development objectives (Chapter 4). Different aspects of these linkages are discussed across the AR6 WGIII report, including concepts and framings (<a class="section-link" data-title="Concepts and Frameworks for Integrating Climate Mitigation and Development" href="/chapters/chapter-1#1.6.2">Section 1.6.2</a>), shifting sustainable development pathways (<a class="section-link" data-title="Shifting Development Pathways" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3">Section 4.3</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4), cross-sectoral interactions (Sections 12.6.1 and 12.6.2), evidence of co-impacts (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of the Results of Studies Where Decarbonisation Transitions are Framed Within the Context of Sustainable Development" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.3">Section 17.3</a>), links with adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation, Development Pathways " href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.2">Section 4.4.2</a>) and accelerating the transition (Sections 13.9, 17.1.1, 17.4.5 and 17.4.6). While the concept of development pathways is salient in all countries, it may particularly resonate with policymakers in developing countries focused on providing basic needs and addressing poverty and inequality, including energy poverty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmad--2009">Ahmad 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fuso%20Nerini--2019">Fuso Nerini et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bel--2020">Bel and Teixidó 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Caetano--2020">Caetano et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#R%C3%B6ser--2020">Röser et al. 2020</a>). Consequently, some countries may frame policies predominantly in terms of accelerating mitigation, while in others a multiple objectives approach linked to development pathways may dominate, depending on their specific socio-economic contexts and priorities, governance capacities (<a class="reference-link" href="#McMeekin--2019">McMeekin et al. 2019</a>) and perceptions of historical responsibility (<a class="reference-link" href="#Winkler--2014">Winkler and Rajamani 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Friman--2015">Friman and Hjerpe 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Winkler--2015">Winkler et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pan--2017">Pan et al. 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Second, since AR5 there is growing attention to enabling transitions over time. Literature on socio-technical transitions, rooted in innovation studies, highlights the need for different policy focus at different stages of a transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2017b">Geels et al. 2017b</a>,a; <a class="reference-link" href="#K%C3%B6hler--2019">Köhler et al. 2019</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Transition and Transformation Processes" href="/chapters/chapter-1#1.7.3">Section 1.7.3</a>). Other literature examines how broad patterns of development drive both social and mitigation outcomes through shifts in policies and a re-alignment of enabling conditions (Chapter 4). Explicit efforts to shift development pathways, for example by shifting patterns of energy demand and urbanisation, therefore offer broader mitigation opportunities (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4). Common to both approaches is an emphasis beyond the short term, and attention to enabling longer-term structural shifts in economies and societies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Taking these trends into account, Figure 13.6 outlines the climate policy landscape, and how it maps to different parts of this Working Group III report. One axis of variation captures alternative framings of desired outcomes in national policymaking – mitigation versus multiple objectives, while the second captures the shift in policymaking from an initial focus on shifting incentives through largely individual policy instruments, to explicit consideration of how policies and economy-wide measures, including those that shift incentives, can combine to enable transitions. As a result, Figure 13.6 represents interconnected policy ideas, but backed by distinct strands of literature.

First, structural system changes are needed for low-carbon transitions, including building low-carbon infrastructure (or example aligning electricity grids and storage with the requirements of new low-carbon technology), and adjusting existing institutions to low-carbon solutions (for example by reforming electricity market design) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bak--2017">Bak et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Patt--2018">Patt and Lilliestam 2018</a>). Second, explicit transformational system changes are necessary, including efforts at directing transformations, such as clear direction setting through the elaboration of shared visions, and coordination across diverse actors across different policy fields, such as climate and industrial policy, and across governance levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Uyarra--2016">Uyarra et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nemet--2017">Nemet et al. 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There are some specific suggestions for policy packages: Van den Bergh et al.

Others question the viability of universally applicable policy packages, and suggest packages need to be tailored to local objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#del%20R%C3%ADo--2014">del Río 2014</a>) Consequently, much of the literature focuses on broad principles for design of policy packages and mixes, as discussed below.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Comprehensiveness, balance and consistency are important criteria for policy packages or mixes (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">robust evidence</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2016">Rogge and Reichardt 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Scobie--2016">Scobie 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2018">Carter et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Santos-lacueva--2018">Santos-lacueva and González 2018</a>). Comprehensiveness assesses the extensiveness of policy packages, including the breadth of system and market failures it addresses (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2016">Rogge and Reichardt 2016</a>). For example, instrument mixes that include only moderate carbon pricing, but are complemented by policies supporting new low-carbon technologies and a moratorium on coal-fired power plants may not only be politically more feasible than stringent carbon pricing alone, but may also limit efficiency losses and lower distributional impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bertram--2015b">Bertram et al. 2015b</a>). Balance captures whether policy instruments are deployed in complementary ways given their different purposes, combining for example technology-push approaches such as public R&amp;D with demand-pull approaches such as an energy tax. A combination of technology-push and demand-pull approaches has been shown to support innovation in energy efficient technologies in OECD countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Costantini--2017">Costantini et al. 2017</a>). Consistency addresses the alignment of policy instruments among each other and with the policy strategy, which may have multiple and not always consistent objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2019">Rogge 2019</a>).

Such policies include stringent carbon pricing; changes in regime rules such as design of electricity markets; reduced support for dominant regime technologies such as removing tax deductions for private motor transport based on internal combustion engines; and changes in the balance of representation of incumbents versus new entrants in deliberation and advisory bodies. For example, CGE modelling for China’s fossil fuel subsidy reform found that integrating both creation and destabilisation policies is able to reduce rebound effects and make the policy mix more effective (<a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2017">Li et al. 2017</a>).

To do so, policies can be sequenced so as to address political obstacles, for example, by initially starting with policies to facilitate the entry of new firms engaged in low-carbon technologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pahle--2018">Pahle et al. 2018</a>). Such policies can generate positive feedbacks by creating constituencies for continuation of those policies, but need to be designed to do so from the outset (<a class="reference-link" href="#Edmondson--2019">Edmondson et al. 2019</a>, 2020). For example, supporting renewable energies through feed-in tariffs can buttress coalitions for more ambitious climate policy, such as through carbon pricing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meckling--2015">Meckling et al. 2015</a>). However, negative policy feedback may also arise from ineffective policy instruments that lose public support, or create concentrated losses that arouse oppositional coalitions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Edmondson--2019">Edmondson et al. 2019</a>).

Other studies have shown the existence of strong complementarities between the SDGs and realisation of NDC pledges by countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2018">McCollum et al. 2018</a>). An explicit attention to development pathways can enhance the scope for mitigation, by paying explicit attention to development choices that lock-in or lock-out opportunities for mitigation, such as around land use and infrastructure choices (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4). While the pay-offs are considerable to an approach to mitigation that takes into account linkages to multiple objectives and the opportunity to shift development pathways, there are also associated challenges with implementing this approach to policymaking.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">First, spanning policy arenas and addressing multiple objectives places considerable requirements of coordination on the policymaking process (Howlett and del Rio 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Obersteiner--2016">Obersteiner et al. 2016</a>). Climate policy integration suggests several steps should precede actual policy formulation, beginning with a clear articulation of the policy frame or problem statement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adelle--2013">Adelle and Russel 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Candel--2016">Candel and Biesbroek 2016</a>). For example, a greenhouse gas limitation framework versus a co-benefits framing would likely yield different policy approaches. It is then useful to identify the range of actors and institutions involved in climate governance – the policy subsystem, the goals articulated, the level at which goals are articulated and the links with other related policy goals such as energy security or energy access (<a class="reference-link" href="#Candel--2016">Candel and Biesbroek 2016</a>). The adoption of specific packages of policy instruments should ideally follow these prior steps that define the scope of the problem, actors and goals.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In practice, integration has to occur in the context of an already existing policy structure, which suggests the need for finding windows of opportunity to bring about integration, which can be created by international events, alignments with domestic institutional procedures, and openings created by policy entrepreneurs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garcia%20Hernandez--2020">Garcia Hernandez and Bolwig 2020</a>). Integration also has to occur in the context of existing organisational routines and cultures, which can pose a barrier to integration (<a class="reference-link" href="#Uittenbroek--2016">Uittenbroek 2016</a>). Experience from the EU suggests that disagreements at the level of policy instruments are amenable to resolution by deliberation, while normative disagreements at the level of objectives require a hierarchical decision structure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Skovgaard--2018">Skovgaard 2018</a>). As this discussion suggests, the challenge of integration operates in two dimensions: horizontal – between sectoral authorities such as ministries or policy domains such as forestry – or vertical – either between constitutional levels of power or within the internal mandates and interactions of a sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Howlett--2015">Howlett and del Rio 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Gregorio--2017">Di Gregorio et al. 2017</a>). There are also important temporal dimensions to policy goals, as policy and benchmarks have to address not just immediate success but also indications of future transformation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dupont--2012">Dupont and Oberthür 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dupont--2015">Dupont 2015</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Second policymaking for shifting development pathways has to account for inherent uncertainties in future development paths (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moallemi--2018">Moallemi and Malekpour 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Castrejon-Campos--2020">Castrejon-Campos et al. 2020</a>). These uncertainties may be greater in developing countries that are growing rapidly and where structural features of the economy including infrastructure and urbanisation patterns are fluid. For example, reviews of modelling studies of Chinese (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grubb--2015">Grubb et al. 2015</a>) and Indian emissions futures (Spencer and <a class="reference-link" href="#Dubash--2021">Dubash 2021</a>) find that differences in projections can substantially be accounted for by alternative assumptions about future economic structural shifts. Consequently, an important design consideration is that policy packages should be robust, that is, perform satisfactorily for all key objectives under a broad range of plausible futures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kwakkel--2016">Kwakkel et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maier--2016">Maier et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Castrejon-Campos--2020">Castrejon-Campos et al. 2020</a>). Such an approach to decision-making can be contrasted with one that tries to design an optimal policy package for the ‘best guess’ future scenario (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maier--2016">Maier et al. 2016</a>). Moreover, policy packages can usefully be adapted dynamically to changing circumstances as part of the policy process (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haasnoot--2013">Haasnoot et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hamarat--2014">Hamarat et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maier--2016">Maier et al. 2016</a>) including by using exploratory modelling techniques that allow comparison of trade-offs across alternative future scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hamarat--2014">Hamarat et al. 2014</a>). Another approach is to link quantitative models with a participatory process that enables decision-makers to test the implications of alternative interventions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moallemi--2018">Moallemi and Malekpour 2018</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Rosenbloom--2019">Rosenbloom et al. (2019)</a> suggest that because policy mixes should adapt to changing circumstances, instead of stability of a particular mix, transitions require embedding policies within a long-term orientation toward a low-carbon economy, including a transition agenda, social legitimacy for this agenda, and an appropriate ecosystem of institutions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Third, achieving changes in development pathways requires engaging with place-specific context. It requires attention to existing policies, political interests that may gain or lose from a transition, and locally specific governance enablers and disablers. As a result, while there may be approaches that carry over from one context to another, implementation requires careful tailoring of transition approaches to specific policy and governance contexts. Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this chapter summarises case studies of sectoral transitions from other chapters in this report (Chapters 5 to 12) to illustrate this complexity. Broader macroeconomic transformative shifts are discussed in more detail in <a class="section-link" data-title="Accelerating Mitigation Through " href="/chapters/chapter-13#13.9">Section 13.9</a>.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Common to all the sectoral cases in Cross-Chapter Box 9 is a future-oriented vision of sectoral transition often focused on multiple objectives, such as designing tram-based public transport systems in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe to simultaneously stimulate urban centers, create jobs and enable low-carbon transportation. Sectoral transitions are enabled by policy mixes that bring together different combinations of instruments – including regulations, financial incentives, convening, education and outreach, voluntary agreements, procurement and creation of new institutions – to work together in a complementary manner. The effectiveness of a policy mix depends on conditions beyond design considerations and also rests on the larger governance context within which sector transitions occur, which can include enabling and disabling elements. Enabling factors illustrated in Cross-Chapter Box 9 include strong high level political support, for example to address deforestation in Brazil despite powerful logging and farmer interests, or policy design to win over existing private interests, for example, by harnessing distribution networks of kerosene providers to new LPG technology in Indonesia. Disabling conditions include local institutional contexts, such as the lack of tree and land tenure in Ghana, which, along with the monopoly of the state marketing board, posed obstacles to Ghana’s low-carbon cocoa transition.

For example, some argue for social tipping interventions (STI) alongside other technical and political interventions so that they can ‘activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviours, social norms, and structural reorganisation’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2020">Otto et al. 2020</a>). They argue that these STIs are <span class="•-Condensed-italic">inter alia</span>: removing fossil fuel subsidies and incentivising decentralised energy generation; building carbon neutral cities; divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels; revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels; strengthening climate education and engagement; and disclosing information of GHG emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2020">Otto et al. 2020</a>). Others illuminate the importance of narratives and framings in the take-up (or not) of acceleration actions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2020">Sovacool et al. 2020</a>).

Broadly, this literature agrees on a dual approach of non-incremental systemic change and a targeting of specific acceleration challenges, with tailored actions drawing on enabling conditions. The underlying argument of this is that there is a strategic logic to focusing on actions which undermine high carbon systems at the same time as encouraging low-carbon systems. If high carbon systems are weakened then this may reduce the opposition to policies and actions aimed at accelerating climate mitigation, enabling more support for low-carbon systems. In addition, targeting of actions which may create ‘tipping point cascades’ which increase the rate of decarbonisation may also be beneficial. Finally, new modes of governance may be better suited to this approach in the context of transformative change.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="13.10"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">13.10</span>Further Research </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-11-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Research has expanded in a number of areas relevant to climate mitigation, yet there is considerable scope to add to knowledge.
