## Executive Summary
**Finance to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts 
 represents a critical enabling factor for the low carbon transition. Fundamental inequities in 
 access to finance as well as its terms and conditions, and countries exposure to physical impacts 
 of climate change overall result in a worsening outlook for a global just transition (high 
 confidence)**. Decarbonising the economy requires global action to address fundamental economic 
 inequities and overcome the climate investment trap that exists for many developing countries. For 
 these countries the costs and risks of financing often represent a significant challenge for stakeholders 
 at all levels. This challenge is exacerbated by these countries’ general economic vulnerability and 
 indebtedness. The rising public fiscal costs of mitigation, and of adapting to climate shocks, is affecting 
 many countries and worsening public indebtedness and country credit ratings at a time when there were 
 already significant stresses on public finances. The COVID-19 pandemic has made these stresses worse 
 and tightened public finances still further. Other major challenges for commercial climate finance 
include: the mismatch between capital and investment needs, home bias1 14 considerations, differences in 
 risk perceptions for regions, as well as limited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards represent.15.2, 15.6.3} 
 
 **Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk. 
 This increased awareness can support climate policy development and implementation (high 
 confidence)**. Climate-related financial risks arise from physical impacts of climate change (already 
 relevant in the short term), and from a disorderly transition to a low carbon economy. Awareness of 
these risks is increasing leading also to concerns about financial stability. Financial regulators and 
 institutions have responded with multiple regulatory and voluntary initiatives by to assess and address 
 these risks. Yet despite these initiatives, climate-related financial risks remain greatly underestimated 
 by financial institutions and markets limiting the capital reallocation needed for the low-carbon 
 transition. Moreover, risks relating to national and international inequity – which act as a barrier to the 
 transformation – are not yet reflected in decisions by the financial community. Stronger steering by 
 regulators and policy makers has the potential to close this gap. Despite the increasing attention of 
 investors to climate change, there is limited evidence that this attention has directly impacted emission 
 reductions. This leaves high uncertainty, both near-term (2021-30) and longer-term (2021-50), on the 
 feasibility of an alignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement (high confidence).  {15.2, 15.6}
 
**Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. 
 There is a climate financing gap which reflects a persistent misallocation of global capital (high 
confidence)**. Persistently high levels of both public and private fossil-fuel related financing continue to 
 be of major concern despite promising recent commitments. This reflects policy misalignment, the 
 current perceived risk-return profile of fossil fuel-related investments, and political economy constraints {15.3}
 
 Estimates of climate finance flows – which refers to local, national, or transnational financing from 
 public, private, multilateral, bilateral and alternative sources, to support mitigation and adaptation 
 actions addressing climate change – exhibit highly divergent patterns across regions and sectors and a 
 slowing growth. {15.3}
 When the perceived risks are too high the misallocation of abundant savings persists. Investors refrain 
 from investing in infrastructure and industry in search of safer financial assets, even earning low or 
 negative real returns. {15.2, 15.3}

 
Global climate finance is heavily focused on mitigation (more than 90% on average between 2017-
2020). This is despite the significant economic effects of climate change’s expected physical impacts, 
 and the increasing awareness of these effects on financial stability. To meet the needs for rapid 
 deployment of mitigation options, global mitigation investments are expected to need to increase by the 
factor of 3 to 6 (high confidence). The gaps represent a major challenge for developing countries, 
especially Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where flows have to increase by factor 4 to 8, for specific 
 sectors like AFOLU, and for specific groups with limited access to-, and high costs of-, climate finance 
(high confidence). {15.4, 15.5}


 The actual size of sectoral and regional climate financing gaps is only one component driving the 
magnitude of the challenge, with financial and economic viability, access to capital markets, appropriate 
 regulatory frameworks and institutional capacity to attract and facilitate investments and ensure 
safeguards being decisive to scale-up financing. Financing needs for the creation and strengthening of 
 regulatory environment and institutional capacity, upstream financing needs as well as R&D and 
 venture capital for development of new technologies and business models are often overlooked despite 
 their critical role to facilitate the deployment of scaled-up climate finance (high confidence).15.4.1, 
 15.5.2} 
 
 **The relatively slow implementation of commitments by countries and stakeholders in the financial 
 system to scale up climate finance reflects neither the urgent need for ambitious climate action, 
 nor the economic rationale for ambitious climate action**. (high confidence). Delayed climate 
 investments and financing – and limited alignment of investment activity with the Paris Agreement –
 will result in significant carbon lock-ins, stranded assets, and other additional costs. This will 
 particularly impact urban infrastructure and the energy and transport sectors (high confidence). A 
 common understanding of debt sustainability and debt transparency, including negative implications of 
 deferred climate investments on future GDP, and how stranded assets and resources may be 
 compensated, has not yet been developed (medium confidence). {15.6}
 
 The greater the urgency of action to remain on a 1.5°C pathway the greater need for parallel investment 
 decisions in upstream and downstream parts of the value chain. Greater urgency also reduces the lead 
 times to build trust in regulatory frameworks. Consequently, many investment decisions will need to be 
 made based on the long-term global goals. This highlights the importance of trust in political leadership 
 which, in turn, affects risk perception and ultimately financing costs (high confidence). {15.6.1, 15.6.2}
 
 
There is a mismatch between capital availability in the developed world and the future emissions 
 expected in developing countries. This emphasizes the need to recognize the explicit and positive social 
 value of global cross-border mitigation financing. A significant push for international climate finance 
 access for vulnerable and poor countries is particularly important given these countries’ high costs of 
financing, debt stress and the impacts of ongoing climate change (high confidence).{15.2, 15.3.2.3,15.5.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.7}

**Ambitious global climate policy coordination and stepped-up (public) climate financing over the 
next decade (2021–2030) can help address macroeconomic uncertainty and alleviate developing 
countries’ debt burden post-COVID-19. It can also help redirect capital markets and overcome 
 challenges relating to the need for parallel investments in mitigation and the up-front risks that 
 deter economically sound low carbon projects**. (high confidence) Providing strong climate policy 
signals helps guide investment decisions. Credible signalling by governments and the international 
 community can reduce uncertainty for financial decision-makers and help reduce transition risk. In 
 addition to indirect and direct subsidies, the public sector’s role in addressing market failures, barriers, 
provision of information, and risk sharing (equity, various forms of public guarantees) can encourage 
 the efficient mobilisation of private sector finance (high confidence).{15.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.2}
 
 
The mutual benefits of coordinated support for climate mitigation and adaptation in the next decade for 
 both developed and developing regions could potentially be very high in the post-Covid era. Climate 
 compatible stimulus packages could significantly reduce the macro-financial uncertainty generated by
the pandemic and increase the sustainability of the world economic recovery. 15.2, 15.3.2.3, 15.5.2, 
2 15.6.1, 15.6.7}

 Political leadership and intervention remains central to addressing uncertainty as a fundamental barrier 
 for a redirection of financial flows. Existing policy misalignments – for example in fossil fuel subsidies 
 – undermine the credibility of public commitments, reduce perceived transition risks and limit financial 
sector action (high confidence). {15.2, 15.3.3, 15.6.1, 15.6.2, 15.6.3}


 **Innovative financing approaches could help reduce the systemic underpricing of climate risk in 
 markets and foster demand for Paris-aligned investment opportunities. Approaches include derisking investments, robust ‘green’ labelling and disclosure schemes, in addition to a regulatory 
 focus on transparency and reforming international monetary system financial sector regulations
(medium confidence)**. Green bond markets and markets for sustainable finance products have grown 
 significantly since AR5 and the landscape continues to evolve. Underpinning this evolution is investors’ 
 preference for scalable and identifiable low-carbon investment opportunities. These relatively new 
 labelled financial products will help by allowing a smooth integration into existing asset allocation 
models. (high confidence) Green bond markets and markets for sustainable finance products have also 
 increased significantly since AR5, but challenges nevertheless remain, in particular there are concerns 
 about ‘greenwashing’ and the limited application of these markets to developing countries. New 
 business models (e.g. pay-as-you-go) can facilitate the aggregation of small-scale financing needs and 
 provide scalable investment opportunities with more attractive risk-return profiles. Support and 
 guidance for enhancing transparency can promote capital markets’ climate financing by providing 
 quality information to price climate risks and opportunities. Examples include sustainable development 
goals (SDG) and environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure, scenario analysis and climate 
 risk assessments, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The 
 outcome of these market-correcting approaches on capital flows cannot be taken for granted, however, 
 without appropriate fiscal, monetary and financial policies. Mitigation policies will be required to 
 enhance the risk-weighted return of low emission and climate resilient options, and - supported by 
 progress in transparent and scientifically based projects’ assessment methods - to accelerate the 
 emergence and support for financial products based on real projects, such as green bonds, and phase 
out fossil fuel subsidies. Greater public-private cooperation can also encourage the private sector to 
 increase and broaden investments, within a context of safeguards and standards, and this can be 
 integrated into national climate change policies and plans{15.1, 15.2.4, 15.3.1, 15.3.2, 15.3.3, 15.5.2, 
32 15.6.1, 15.6.2, 15.6.6, 15.6.7, 15.6.8}. 
 
**The following policy options can have important long-term catalytic benefits** (high confidence). 
 (i) Stepped-up both the quantum and composition of financial, technical support and partnership in low income and vulnerable countries alongside low-carbon energy access in low-income countries, such as 
Sub-Saharan Africa, which currently receives less than 5% of global climate financing flows; (ii) 
continued strong role of international and national financial institutions, including multilateral, 
especially location-based regional, and national development banks; (iii) de-risking cross-border 
 investments in low-carbon infrastructure, development of local green bond markets, and the alignment 
 of climate and non-climate policies, including direct and in-direct supports on fossil fuels, consistent 
 with the climate goals; (iv) lowering financing costs including transaction costs and addressing risks 
 through funds and risk-sharing mechanisms for under-served groups; (v) accelerated finance for nature based solutions, including mitigation in the forest sector (REDD+), and climate-responsive social 
 protection; (vi) improved financing instruments for loss and damage events, including risk-pooling transfer-sharing for climate risk insurance; (vii) phasing-in carbon pricing and phasing out fossil fuel 
 subsidies in a way that addresses equity and access; and (viii) gender-responsive and women 
 empowered programs {15.2.3, 15.2.4, 15.3.1, 15.3.2.2, 15.3.3, 15.4.1, 15.4.2, 15.4.3, 15.5.2, 15.6,
