<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A globally warm period lasting thousands of years between <em>glacial</em> periods within an <em>ice age</em>.</p>
<p>Generally coincides with odd-numbered <em>marine isotope stages (MIS)</em> when mean sea level was close to present. The Last Interglacial (LIG) occurred between about 129 and 116 ka (thousand years) before present (defined as 1950) although the warm period started in some areas a few thousand years earlier. In terms of MIS, <em>interglaciations</em> are defined as the interval between the midpoint of the preceding termination and the onset of the next glaciation. The LIG coincides with MIS 5e. The present interglaciation, the <em>Holocene</em>, started at 11,700 years before 2000 CE, although global mean sea level did not approach its present position until roughly 7000 years ago.</p>
