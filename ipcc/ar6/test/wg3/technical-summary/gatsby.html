However, climate change mitigation also has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs. There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per-capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation. However, recent evidence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions. Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and capabilities. Given the differences in GHG emissions contributions, degree of vulnerability and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep decarbonisation. Achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale. Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability. International cooperation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development. Pathways that illustrate movement towards fulfilling the SDGs are shown in Figure TS.1. <!-- -->{1.4, 1.6, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17}</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer011"><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" id="figure-ts-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_TS_1.png"/></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_&#8226;-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="&#8226;-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure TS.1 | </span></span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Sustainable development pathways towards fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals. </span>The graph shows global average per-capita GHG emissions (vertical axis) and relative &#8216;Historic Index of Human Development&#8217; (HIHD) levels (horizonal) have increased globally since the industrial revolution (grey line).

In addition to being deeply intertwined, all the factors matter to varying degrees, depending on the prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context. They often both drive and inhibit transitions at the same time, within and across different scales. The development <span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"/> and deployment of innovative technologies and systems at scale are important for achieving deep decarbonisation, and in recent years, the cost of several low-carbon technologies has declined sharply as deployment has risen rapidly.

The interaction between politics, economics and power relationships is central to explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action. At the same time, attention to, and support for, climate policies and low-carbon societal transitions has generally increased, as the impacts have become more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and balance of high- and low-carbon investments. Societal and behavioural norms, regulations and institutions are essential conditions to accelerate low-carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major transition. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had far-reaching impacts on the global economic and social system, and recovery will present both challenges and opportunities for climate mitigation.

The effective governance of climate change entails strong action across multiple jurisdictions and decision-making levels, including regular evaluation and learning. Choices that cause climate change as well as the processes for making and implementing relevant decisions involve a range of non-nation state actors such as cities, businesses, and civil society organisations. At global, national and sub-national levels, climate change actions are interwoven with, and embedded in, the context of much broader social, economic and political goals. Therefore, the governance required to address climate change has to navigate power, political, economic, and social dynamics at all levels of decision-making. Effective climate-governing institutions, and openness to experimentation on a variety of institutional arrangements, policies and programmes can play a vital role in engaging stakeholders and building momentum for effective climate action. <!-- -->{1.4, 1.9, Chapters 8, 13, 15, 17}</p><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_&#8226;-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns ParaOverride-1" lang="en-US"><span class="&#8226;-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table TS.1</span></span><span class="&#8226;-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> | </span></span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Signs of progress and continuing challenges. </span></p><table class="IPCC-Table TableOverride-1 noborder tstable" id="table001"><colgroup><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-1"/><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-2"/></colgroup><thead><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3"><td class="IPCC-Table &#8226;-Header-row--blue- &#8226;-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_&#8226;-Table-header-row--blue--left-align" lang="en-US"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Signs of progress</span></p></td><td class="IPCC-Table &#8226;-Header-row--blue- &#8226;-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_&#8226;-Table-header-row--blue--left-align" lang="en-US"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Continuing challenges</span></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4"><td class="IPCC-Table &#8226;-Subhead-row--white- &#8226;-Body-row CellOverride-1 _idGenCellOverride-1 bluerow" colspan="2"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_&#8226;-Table-header-row--black--left-align-&#8211;-7pt" lang="en-US">Emissions trends</p></td></tr><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5"><td class="IPCC-Table &#8226;-Body-row &#8226;-Body-row CellOverride-2"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_&#8226;-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">The rate of global GHG emissions growth has slowed in recent years, </span> from 2.1% yr <span class="&#8226;-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">&#8211;1</span> between 2000 and 2009, to 1.3% yr <span class="&#8226;-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">&#8211;1</span> in between 2010 and 2019.

A wide range of GHG emission metrics has been published in the scientific literature, which differ in terms of: (i) the key measure of climate change they consider, (ii) whether they consider climate outcomes for a specified point in time or integrated over a specified time horizon, (iii) the time horizon over which the metric is applied, (iv) whether they apply to a single emission pulse, to emissions sustained over a period of time, or to a combination of both, and (v) whether they consider the climate effect from an emission compared to the absence of that emission, or compared to a reference emissions level or climate state. <!-- -->{Annex II}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Parties to the Paris Agreement decided to report aggregated emissions and removals (expressed as CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4">2</span>-eq) based on the Global Warming Potential (GWP) with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) using values from IPCC AR5 or from a subsequent IPCC report as agreed upon by the CMA, <span class="CharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ts.html#footnote-023">10</a> </span></span> and to account for future Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in accordance with this approach.

The choice of GWP100 was made <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">inter alia</span> for consistency with decisions under the Rulebook for the Paris Agreement and because it is the dominant metric used in the literature assessed by WGIII. Furthermore, for mitigation pathways that limit global warming to 2&#176;C (&gt;67%) or lower, using GWP100 to inform cost-effective abatement choices between gases would achieve such long-term temperature goals at close to least global cost within a few percent (<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">However, GWP100 is not well-suited to estimate the cumulative effect on climate from sustained SLCF emissions and the resulting warming at specific points in time. This is because the warming caused by an individual SLCF emission pulse is not permanent, and hence, unlike CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, the warming from successive SLCF emission pulses over multiple decades or centuries depends mostly on their ongoing rate of emissions rather than cumulative emissions. Recently developed step/pulse metrics such as the CGTP (combined global temperature change potential) and GWP* (referred to as GWP-star and indicated by an asterisk) recognise that a sustained increase/decrease in the rate of SLCF emissions has indeed a similar effect on global surface temperature as one-off emission/removal of CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>. These metrics use this relationship to calculate the CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions or removals that would result in roughly the same temperature change as a sustained change in the rate of SLCF emissions (CGTP) over a given time period, or as a varying time series of CH<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> emissions (GWP*).

In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the four renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, costs shown are for 1 kWh of battery storage capacity; for the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced. The literature uses LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made.

lang="en-GB">In this report, <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">development pathways</span> refer to the patterns of development resulting from multiple decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether in developing or developed regions follows its own pattern of growth (Figure TS.13). Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities) and for sectoral systems.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Development pathways are major drivers of GHG emissions <!-- -->{1, 2}<!-- -->. There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways will not achieve rapid and deep emission reductions. In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy instruments may not be able to limit global emissions to a degree sufficient to meet ambitious mitigation goals or they may only be able to do so at very high economic and social costs.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Policies to shift development pathways, on the other hand, make mitigation policies more effective. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between sustainable development objectives and mitigation. Development pathways also determine the enablers and levers available for adaptation <!-- -->{AR6 WGII TS.E.1.2}<!-- --> and for achieving other SDGs.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of other development objectives can go hand in hand <!-- -->{Chapter 3, Figure 3.33, Chapters 6&#8211;12, and 17}<!-- -->. Integrated policies can support the creation of synergies between <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">action to combat climate change and its impacts</span> (SDG 13 &#8211; climate action) and other SDGs. For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are combined with electrification and clean renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained. These include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air, and benefits from enhanced mobility <!-- -->{8.2, 8.4, 4.4.1}<!-- -->. Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also deliver significant health benefits. <!-- -->{9.8.1 and 9.8.2}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">However, decisions about mitigation actions, and their timing and scale, may entail trade-offs with the achievement of other national development objectives in the near, mid- and long term <!-- -->{Chapter 12}<!-- -->. In the near term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green spaces within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and push low-income residents outside the city <!-- -->{8.2.2}<!-- -->. In the mid- and long term, large-scale deployment of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation <!-- -->{3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2, 12.5.3}<!-- -->. Prioritising is one way to manage these trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability (SDPS) as they expand the range of tools available to simultaneously achieve multiple development objectives and accelerate mitigation.

Changes that involve &#8216;dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components&#8217; take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning, even when they promise large gains. Despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector, and social stakeholders. Shifts in development pathways result from both sustained political interventions and bottom-up changes in public opinion.

These proactive measures include eradication of poverty, regulating prosperity and creating jobs in &#8216;green&#8217; sectors. In addition, governments, polluting industries, corporations, and those more able to pay higher associated taxes, can pay for transition costs by providing a welfare safety net and adequate compensation to people, communities, and regions that have been impacted by pollution, or are marginalised, or are negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society.

given category as defined in Box SPM.1. For emissions-related columns these values relate to the distribution of all the pathways in that category. Harmonised emissions values are given for consistency with projected global warming outcomes using climate emulators. Based on the assessment of climate emulators in AR6 WGI (WG1 Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators are used for the probabilistic assessment of the resulting warming of the pathways. For the &#8216;Temperature change&#8217; and &#8216;Likelihood&#8217; columns, the single upper-row values represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges, the median warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators (MAGICC and FaIR). Subsequently, the 5th and 95th percentile values across all pathways for each emulator are calculated.

In the studies that perform a sensitivity analysis, this result is found to be robust to a wide range of assumptions on social preferences (in particular on inequality aversion and pure rate of time preference), and holds except if assumptions of economic damages from climate change are in the lower end of available estimates and the pure rate of time preference is in the higher range of values usually considered (typically above 1.5%). <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic"/>However, although such pathways bring overall net benefits over time (in terms of aggregate discounted present value), they involve distributional consequences between and within generations. <!-- -->{3.6.2}</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="TS.5"><h1 class="Headings_&#8226;-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">TS.5</span> <span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Mitigation Responses in Sectors and Systems</span><span class="share-block"><img class="share-icon" src="../../share.png"/></span><button class="btn-ipcc btn btn-primary chapter-expand">Expand section</button></h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-5-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Chapters 5 to 12 assess recent advances in knowledge in individual sectors and systems.

As a general rule, and across all sectors, it is more efficient to use electricity directly and avoid the progressively larger conversion losses from producing hydrogen, ammonia, or constructed low GHG hydrocarbons. What hydrogen does do, however, is add time and space option value to electricity produced using variable clean sources, for use as hydrogen, as stored future electricity via a fuel cell or turbine, or as an industrial feedstock. Furthermore, electrification and hydrogen involve a symbiotic range of general-purpose technologies, such as electric motors, power electronics, heat pumps, batteries, electrolysis, fuel cells, and so on, that have different applications across sectors but cumulative economies of innovation and production scale benefits. Finally, neither electrification nor hydrogen produce local air pollutants at point of end-use.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">For almost 140 years we have primarily produced electricity by burning coal, oil, and gas to drive steam turbines connected to electricity generators.

In future power systems with high shares of variable electricity from renewable sources, system planning and markets will focus more on demand flexibility, grid infrastructure and interconnections, storage on various timelines (on the minute, hourly, overnight and seasonal scale), and increased coupling between the energy sector and the building, transport and industrial sectors. This shifts the focus to energy systems that can handle variable supply rather than always follow demand. Hydrogen may prove valuable to improve the resilience of electricity systems with high penetration of variable renewable electricity.

Many of these options also provide benefits to climate adaptation.

Implementing sufficiency measures that limit growth in floor area per capita, particularly in developed regions, reduces the dependence of climate mitigation on technological solutions. <!-- -->{Figure 9.5, Box 9.2}</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"><a href="/report/ar6/wg3/figures/chapter-ts/figure-ts-15" target="_blank"><button class="btn-ipcc btn btn-primary ch-figure-button">Open figure</button></a> </div></div><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The potential associated with sufficiency measures, as well as the replacement of appliances, equipment and lights by efficient ones, is below zero cost (</span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>The construction of high-performance buildings is expected to become a business-as-usual technology by 2050 with costs below USD20 tCO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4">2</span><span class="&#8226;-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-4">&#8211;1</span><span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4"/> in developed countries and below USD100 tCO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4">2</span><span class="&#8226;-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-4">&#8211;1</span><span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4"/> in developing countries (<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>).

Both supply- and demand-side measures are important to reduce the GHG intensity of food systems. Integrated food policy packages based on a combination of market-based, administrative, informative, and behavioural policies can reduce cost compared to uncoordinated interventions, address multiple sustainability goals, and increase acceptance across stakeholders and civil society (<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">limited evidence</span>, <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">medium agreement </span>)<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">. </span>Food systems governance may be pioneered through local food policy initiatives complemented by national and international initiatives, but governance on the national level tends to be fragmented, and thus has limited capacity to address structural issues like inequities in access.

Some of these methods (like afforestation and soil carbon sequestration) have been practiced for decades to millennia, although not necessarily with the intention to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Conversely, for methods such as DACCS and BECCS, experience is growing but still limited in scale. A categorisation of CDR methods can be based on several criteria, depending on the highlighted characteristics. In this report, the categorisation is focused on the role of CDR methods in the carbon cycle, that is on the removal process (<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">land-based biological</span>; <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">ocean-based biological</span>; <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">geochemical</span>; <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">chemical</span>) and on the time scale of storage (<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">decades to centuries</span>; <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">centuries to millennia</span>; <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">10,000 years or longer</span>), the latter being closely linked to different carbon storage media. Within one category (e.g., ocean-based biological CDR) options often differ with respect to other dynamic or context-specific dimensions such as mitigation potential, cost, potential for co-benefits and adverse side effects, and technology readiness level. (Table TS.7, TS.5.6, TS. 5.7) <!-- -->{12.3}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body-last" lang="en-GB">It is useful to distinguish between CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> removal from the atmosphere as the outcome of deliberate activities implementing CDR options, and the net emissions outcome achieved with the help of CDR deployment (i.e., gross emissions minus gross removals). As part of ambitious mitigation strategies at global or national levels, gross CDR can fulfil three different roles in complementing emissions abatement: (i) lowering net CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions in the near term; (ii) counterbalancing &#8216;hard-to-abate&#8217; residual emissions such as CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> from industrial activities and long-distance transport, or CH<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and nitrous oxide from agriculture, in order to help reach net zero CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions in the mid-term; (iii) achieving net negative CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions in the long term if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions <!-- -->{2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5}<!-- -->. These roles of CDR are not mutually exclusive: for example, achieving net zero CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions globally might involve individual developed countries attaining net negative CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions at the time of global net zero, thereby

Potentials in 2050 are estimated using the International Energy Agency&#8217;s 2020 World Energy Outlook STEPS (Stated Policy Scenarios) as a baseline. This scenario is based on a sector-by-sector assessment of specific policies in place, as well as those that have been announced by countries by mid-2020. This scenario was selected due to the detailed representation of options across sectors and sub-sectors. The heights of the coloured columns represent the potentials on which there is a high level of agreement in the literature, based on a range of case studies. The range shown by the dots connected by dotted lines represents the highest and lowest potentials reported in the literature which have low to medium levels of agreement. The demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors in the food system has two parts. The economic potential of direct emissions (mostly non-CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) demand reduction through socio-cultural factors alone is 1.9 GtCO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq without considering land-use change by diversion of agricultural land from food production to carbon sequestration. If further changes in land use enabled by this change in demand are considered, the indicative potential could reach 7 GtCO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq. The electricity panel presents separately the mitigation potential from changes in electricity demand and changes associated with enhanced electrification in end-use sectors. Electrification increases electricity demand, while it is avoided though demand-side mitigation strategies. Load management refers to demand-side flexibility that can be achieved through incentive design such as time-of-use pricing/monitoring by artificial intelligence, diversification of storage facilities, and so on. NZE (IEA Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario) is used to compute the impact of end-use sector electrification, while the impact of demand-side response options is based on bottom-up assessments. Dark grey columns show the emissions that cannot be avoided through demand-side mitigation options. The table indicates which demand-side mitigation options are included. Options are categorised according to: socio-cultural factors, infrastructure use, and technology adoption. Figure SPM.7 covers potential of demand-side options for the year 2050. Figure SPM.8 covers both supply- and demand-side options and their potentials for the year 2030. <!-- -->{5.3, Figure 5.7, 5.SM.II}</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"><a href="/report/ar6/wg3/figures/chapter-ts/figure-ts-21" target="_blank"><button class="btn-ipcc btn btn-primary ch-figure-button">Open figure</button></a> </div></div><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Socio-cultural and lifestyle changes can accelerate climate change mitigation (</span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">medium confidence</span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>Among 60 identified actions that could change individual consumption, individual mobility choices have the largest potential to reduce carbon footprints. <span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"/>Prioritising <span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"/> car-free mobility by walking and cycling and adoption of electric mobility could save 2 tCO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4">2</span>-eq cap <span class="&#8226;-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-4">&#8211;1</span> yr <span class="&#8226;-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-4">&#8211;1</span>.

From AR1 to AR4, rational choice was the implicit assumption: agents with perfect information and unlimited processing capacity maximising self-focused expected utility and differing only in wealth, risk attitude, and time discount rate. The AR5 introduced a broader range of goals (material, social, and psychological) and decision processes (calculation-based, affect-based, and rule-based processes). However, its perspective was still individual- and agency-focused, neglecting structural, cultural, and institutional constraints and the influence of physical and social context.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB">A social science perspective is important in two ways. By adding new actors and perspectives, it (i) provides more options for climate mitigation; and (ii) helps to identify and address important social and cultural barriers and opportunities to socio-economic, technological, and institutional change. Demand-side mitigation involves five sets of social actors: individuals (e.g., consumption choices, habits), groups and collectives (e.g., social movements, values), corporate actors (e.g., investments, advertising), institutions (e.g., political agency, regulations), and infrastructure actors (e.g., very long-term investments and financing). Actors either contribute to the status-quo of global high-carbon consumption, and a GDP growth-oriented economy, or help generate the desired change to a low-carbon energy-services, well-being, and equity-oriented economy. Each set of actors has novel implications for the design and implementation of both demand- and supply-side mitigation policies. They show important synergies, making energy demand mitigation a dynamic problem where the packaging and/or sequencing of different policies play a role in their effectiveness <!-- -->{5.5, 5.6}<!-- -->. Incremental interventions change social practices, simultaneously affecting emissions and well-being. The transformative change requires coordinated action across all five sets of actors (Table 5.4), using social science insights about intersection of behaviour, culture, institutional and infrastructural changes for policy design and implementation. <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">Avoid</span>, <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">Shift </span>, and <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">Improve</span> choices by individuals, households and communities support mitigation <!-- -->{5.3.1.1, Table 5.1}<!-- -->.

To some extent, arguments on both sides are aligned with different analytic frameworks, including assumptions about the main barriers to mitigation that international cooperation can help overcome.

Moreover, risks relating to national and international inequity &#8211; which act as a barrier to the transformation &#8211; are not yet reflected in decisions by the financial community.

Data on mitigation investments do not include technical assistance (i.e., policy and national budget support or capacity building), other non-technology deployment financing. Adaptation only flows are also excluded. Data on mitigation investment requirements for electricity are based on emission pathways C1, C2 and C3 (Table SPM.1).

For instance, there can be many synergies in urban areas between mitigation policies and the SDGs but capturing these depends on the overall planning of urban structures and on local integrated policies such as combining affordable housing and spatial planning with walkable urban areas, green electrification and clean renewable energy (<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>)<span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">. </span>Integrated planning and cross-sectoral alignment of climate change policies are also particularly evident in developing countries&#8217; NDCs under the Paris Agreement, where key priority sectors such as agriculture and energy are closely aligned with the proposed mitigation and adaptation actions and the SDGs <span class="&#8226;-Condensed-italic">. </span>{12.6.2, Supplementary Material Table 17.SM.1, 17.3.3}</p><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The feasibility of deploying response options is shaped by barriers and enabling conditions across geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural, and institutional dimensions (</span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="&#8226;-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>Accelerating the deployment of response options depends on reducing or removing barriers across these dimensions, as well on establishing and strengthening enabling conditions.

For example: the institutional, legal and administrative capacity to support deployment varies across countries; the feasibility of options that involve large-scale land-use changes is highly context-dependent; spatial planning has a higher potential in early stages of urban development; the geophysical potential of geothermal is site-specific; and cultural and local conditions may either inhibit or enable demand-side responses.

Examples of indicators include impacts on land use, air pollution, economic costs, technology scalability, public acceptance and political acceptance (see Box TS.15, and Annex II.IV.11 for a detailed explanation). An indicator could refer to a barrier or an enabler to implementation, or could refer to both a barrier or an enabler, depending on the context, speed, and scale of implementation.

A dark grey dot indicates that one of the feasibility indicators within that dimension is not relevant for the deployment of the option.
