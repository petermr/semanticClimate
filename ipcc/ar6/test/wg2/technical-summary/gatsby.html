It provides technical understanding and is developed from the key findings of chapters and cross-chapter papers (CCPs) as presented in their executive summaries and integrates across them. The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC and three special reports of the AR6 cycle providing new knowledge and updates. The three special reports are the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (2018), an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty; the Special Report on Climate Change and Land, which is concerned with climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (2019); and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019). The WGII assessment integrates with the WGI (the physical science basis) and WGIII (mitigation of climate change) contributions and contributes to the Synthesis Report.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The contribution of Working Group II (WGII) to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC summarizes the current understanding of observed climate change impacts on ecosystems, human societies and their cities, settlements, infrastructures and industrial systems, as well as vulnerabilities and future risks tied to different socioeconomic development pathways. The report is set against a current backdrop of rapid urbanisation, biodiversity loss, a growing and dynamic global human population, significant inequality and demands for social justice, rapid technological change, continuing poverty, land degradation and food insecurity, and risks from shocks such as pandemics and increasingly intense extreme events from ongoing climate change. The report also assesses existing adaptations and their feasibility and limits. Any success of adaptation is dependent on the achieved level of mitigation and the transformation of global and regional sustainability outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, adaptation is essential for climate resilient development. Compared to earlier IPCC assessments, this report integrates more strongly across the natural, social and economic sciences, highlighting the role of social justice and diverse forms of knowledge, such as Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, and reflects the increasing importance of urgent and immediate action to address climate risk. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.1.1<!-- -->}</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, climate action has increased at all levels of governance, including among non-governmental organisations, small and large enterprises, and citizens. Two international agreements&#8212;the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&#8212;jointly provide overarching goals for climate action. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015 by UN member states, sets out 17 SDGs, frames policies for achieving a more sustainable future and aligns efforts globally to prioritise ending extreme poverty, protect the planet and promote more peaceful, prosperous and inclusive societies. Since AR5, several new international conventions have identified climate change adaptation and risk reduction as important global priorities for sustainable development, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the finance-oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the New Urban Agenda. The Convention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi targets recognise that biodiversity is affected by climate change, with negative consequences for human well-being, but biodiversity, through ecosystem services, contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.1.2<!-- -->}</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="TS.A.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">TS.A.2 TS Structure of the Report <span class="arrow-up"/><span class="arrow-down"/><span class="share-block"><img class="share-icon" src="../../share.png"/></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-2-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This technical summary is structured in five sections: Section A &#8216;Introduction&#8217;, Section B &#8216;Observed Impacts and Adaptation&#8217;, Section C &#8216;Projected Impacts and Risks&#8217;, Section D &#8216;Contribution of Adaptation to Solutions&#8217; and Section E &#8216;Climate Resilient Development&#8217;.

The risk framing can move beyond the limits of single best estimates or most likely outcomes and include high-consequence outcomes for which probabilities are low or in some cases unknown. In this report, the risk framing for the first time spans all three working groups, includes risks from the responses to climate change, considers dynamic and cascading consequences, describes with more geographic detail risks to people and ecosystems, and assesses such risks over a range of scenarios. The focus on solutions encompasses the interconnections among climate responses, sustainable development and transformation&#8212;and the implications for governance across scales within the public and private sectors. The assessment therefore includes climate-related decision-making and risk management, climate resilient development pathways, implementation and evaluation of adaptation, and also limits to adaptation and loss and damage. Specific focal areas reflect contexts increasingly important for the implementation of responses, such as cities. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.3.1, 1.4.4, 16, 17, 18<!-- -->}</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Second, emphases on social justice, equity and different forms of expertise have emerged.

In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system. In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not to achieve the intended objective(s) or from potential trade-offs or negative side-effects. <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Risk management </span> is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary<!-- -->}</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Vulnerability</span> is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus. Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (Annex II: Glossary). Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved. An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included&#8212;and often started with&#8212;exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability. From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual determinants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across contexts. Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time. In WGII AR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature, both critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence. In this context, <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">exposure</span> is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected. Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as more dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary<!-- -->}</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Adaptation</span> in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails a process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, autonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation. Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: (a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) monitoring and evaluation. Government, non-government, and private-sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, conform to these five general stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes <span class="condensed_italic" lang="">autonomous</span> adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also involves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation options can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of so-called green and grey infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees). The WGII AR6 emphasises the assessment of observed adaptation-related responses to climate change, governance and decision-making in adaptation and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-scale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.2.1, 17.4<!-- -->}</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Resilience</span> in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum of meanings. Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity and, thus, risk, and resilience as a strategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and transformation. Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance. <!-- -->{<!-- -->1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary<!-- -->}</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-ts.2"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box TS.2 | AR6 Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods</span> <span class="arrow-up"/><span class="arrow-down"/><span class="share-block"><img class="share-icon" src="../../share.png"/></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-9-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Assessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses.

Climate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding socioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as appropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are many emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome.

Where available, WGII also assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs.

RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods are described in SM16.6 and are identical to AR5, but are enhanced by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6.

Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness of the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); likelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. The full set of 127 assessed global and regional key risks is given in SMTS.4 and SM16.7. Diagrams are provided for some risks. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and South America were limited by the availability of adequately downscaled climate projections, with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socio-economic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting low number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels. Absence of risks diagrams does not imply absence of risks within a region.

The section begins with an explanation of overall progress on adaptation and the adaptation gaps and then discusses limits to adaptation. Maladaptation and the underlying evidence base are explained together with the strategies available to strengthen the biosphere that can help ecosystems function in a changing climate. Different adaptation options across water, food, nutrition and ecosystem-based adaptation and other nature-based solutions are also discussed and, in particular, the ways in which urban systems and infrastructure are coping with adaptation. Adaptation to sea level rise is specifically discussed given its global impact on coastal areas, while health, well-being, migration and conflict are also explained as these warrant additional important considerations. Justice and equity have a significant impact as well on how effective adaptation can be and are discussed as key issues that relate to decision-making processes on adaptation and the range of enablers that can support adaptation. Lastly, the focus shifts to system transitions and transformational adaptation that are needed to move climate change adaptation forward in a rapidly warming world.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="Adaptation"><h2 class="Headings_H3-unnumbered" lang="de-DE"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Adaptation progress and gaps</span><span class="arrow-up"/><span class="arrow-down"/><span class="share-block"><img class="share-icon" src="../../share.png"/></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h3-21-siblings"><p class="TS_Technical-Summary_TS-introduction_head ParaOverride-3" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">TS.D.1 Increasing adaptation is being observed in natural and human systems (</span><span class="bold_condensed_italic" lang="">very high confidence</span><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">), yet the majority of climate risk management and adaptation currently being planned and implemented are incremental (</span><span class="bold_condensed_italic" lang="">high confidence</span><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">).
