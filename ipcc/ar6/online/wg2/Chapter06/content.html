Integrated development planning that connects innovation and investment in social, ecological and grey/physical infrastructures can significantly increase the adaptive capacity of urban settlements and cities. Transitioning cities to low carbon development and equitable resilience may lead to trade-offs with dominant models of economic growth based on housing and infrastructure investment. Integrated planning approaches are important for climate resilient development to enable planning and monitoring of interactions between development, mitigation and adaptation. Urban adaptation measures can offer a considerable contribution to climate resilient development. This potential is realised by adaptations that extend predominant physical infrastructure approaches to also deploy nature-based solutions and social interventions. The most consistent limit for all infrastructure types is in risk transfer. Current adaptation approaches in cities, settlements and key infrastructure tend to move risk from one sector or place to others.

Many rural places are so deeply connected to urban systems that risks are observed to cascade from one to the other, for example, when drought in arable zones leads to food insecurity in cities, or where flood damage to urban transport infrastructure leads to prolonged isolation of small towns and rural settlements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Friend--2018">Friend and Thinphanga, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McIntyre-Mills--2018">McIntyre-Mills and Wirawan, 2018</a>). A focus of this chapter is the experience of a range of urban settlements, from small to large, and the connecting infrastructure and formal and informal networks and systems that join them to each other. There are close synergies with Chapters 7 (Health, Well-being and the Changing Structure of Communities) and 8 (Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development). There are further important synergies with Working Group III <a class="section-link" data-title="Poverty, livelihoods and sustainable development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> (Urban Systems and Other Settlements) and the Cross-Chapter Paper 2: Cities and Settlements by the Sea.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Well-planned climate adaptation can have far reaching co-benefits for sustainable development and community well-being (Nerini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Tonmoy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).

The agreements identify ‘sustainable cities and communities’ (SDG11) and ‘cities and subnational authorities’ (Paris Agreement) as important actors in integrating climate and development goals (Sanchez Rodriguez, Ürge-Vorsatz and Barau, 2018).

Voluntary, networked action led by cities was also illustrated by a November 2019 call to Mayors and youth climate activists to sign a voluntary pledge in a ‘Race to Zero’ ahead of the Conference of the Parties 26, which included endorsing principles of a New Green Deal (<a class="reference-link" href="#C40--2019">C40, 2019</a>).

In AR5, the section on ‘human settlements, industry, and infrastructure’ contained three chapters: urban areas; rural areas; and key economic sectors and services. This chapter covers the full range of human settlements: from small settlements in predominantly rural areas, to large metropolises in both high-income and low-income countries. It also assesses evidence of climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation on a range of urban infrastructures, including infrastructure that incorporates socio-economic and ecosystem dimensions (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Terminology and Definitions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.1.3">Section 6.1.3</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This assessment also considers new literature about how enabling environments can support adaptation in ways that are also sensitive to Indigenous knowledge and Local knowledge (see below <a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction and Points of Departure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.1">Section 6.1</a>), social justice (6.4.3.4)) and climate mitigation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Building Design and Construction" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.5.2">Section 6.3.5.2</a>). It builds on the findings of AR5 which highlighted the concentration of global climate risks in urban areas, the complex causal chains that mediate climate impacts for smaller settlements and rural areas, and the multiple issues shaping and influencing economic sectors and infrastructure. This integrated chapter enables a more detailed analysis of the inter-connected drivers of risk that affect urban people and settlements of different sizes. This discussion also highlights the inter-connections within and between urban areas, and between different types of infrastructure and how these complex relationships accentuate or limit the effects of climate change and the institutional structures that play a critical role in mediating and govern these relationships.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This chapter has five main sections.

Effective municipal governance systems and cooperative multi-level governance supported adaptation action. The AR5 report expressed <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> that governance interventions can help develop synergies across geographical and institutional scales. Urban areas face challenges of infrastructure investment and maintenance, land use management, livelihood creation and ecosystem services protection. AR5 also considered how urban localities can encourage incremental and transformative adaptation, build resilience and support sustainable development. The assessment identified the need for multi-level and multi-partner action in rapidly growing cities where institutions and infrastructure are still not established to meet the growing demands of the cities. However, there was only <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> that adaptation action was happening in the AR5 review period.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The framing of ‘key economic sectors and services’ in AR5 focused primarily on three infrastructural areas (energy, water services, transport) and on primary and secondary economic activities (including recreation and tourism, insurance and financial services). Cities, settlements and key infrastructure are also referred to in the IPCC special reports released since AR5. The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>) examines impacts of global warming on urban systems and infrastructure in the context of advancing sustainable development and eradicating poverty. It highlights the risks facing residents of unplanned and informal urban settlements, many of which are exposed to a range of climate-related hazards (Sections 3.4.8 and 4.4.1.3). The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C also identifies green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water management as key adaptation options that can reduce risks in urban areas (SPM C2.4; C2.5), and highlights ‘urban and infrastructure’ as one of four system transitions required to limit warming to 1.5°C to create an enabling environment for adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Impacts on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH)" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.3.3">Section 4.3.3</a>). Innovative governance arrangements that go beyond formal ‘government’ and political arrangements and that include non-state actors, networks and informal institutions were identified as important in addressing climate change and implementing responses to 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C [Sections 4.4.1 and 5.6.2]). In addition, the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C mentions, with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>, the climate-related health effects of urban heat islands, urban heatwaves and increasing risks from some vector-borne diseases (illnesses caused by pathogens and parasites in human populations) (SPM B5.2). The report also notes both trade-offs and important co-benefits of sustainable development in pursuit of climate resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (SPM D6).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere (SROCC) similarly emphasizes the role governance plays in reducing disaster risk, through planning, and zoning (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>). It identifies vulnerability factors such as poverty, which can undermine resilience and sustainable development in urban communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a> SPM C3.1,and <a class="section-link" data-title="Hazards and Exposure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.3">Section 2.3.2</a>) The SROCC report shows that the emerging climate-related challenges are impacting the accessibility and availability of vital resources and blurring the public and private boundaries of risk and responsibility (Cross-Chapter Box 3). According to the SROCC report, new governance arrangements are emerging to address these challenges, including participatory and networked structures, and institutions linking formal and informal networks involving state, private sector, Indigenous and civil society actors (Cross-Chapter Box 3). The SROCC report calls for place-specific action because there is no single climate governance panacea for the ocean, coasts and cryosphere (Cross-Chapter Box 3). The SROCC report highlights evidence of the importance of inclusivity, fairness, deliberation, reflexivity, responsiveness, social learning, the co-production of knowledge, and respect for ethical and cultural diversity in climate-related urban decision making (Cross-Chapter Box 3). In addition, the Special Report on Climate Change and Land notes that urbanisation can intensify extreme rainfall events over the city or downwind of urban areas and have can significant consequences for heat island effects on loss of food production, posing additional risks to the food system (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a> SPM A5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">An additional research bridge between AR5 and AR6 was the IPCC Cities and Climate Change Science conference held in Edmonton, Canada, in March 2018 (Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019). This generated a ‘Global Research and Action Agenda on Cities and Climate Change Science’ (Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019), which highlights six topical research areas where more evidence is needed to inform action: finance; informality; uncertainty; urban planning and design; built and green/blue infrastructure; and sustainable consumption and production.

This report presents two new global definitions of urbanisation reflecting the degree of urbanisation on a continuum of cities, towns and semi-dense areas, and rural areas. The OECD estimates almost half the world’s population (48%) live in cities, while just 24% live in rural areas and 28% live in towns and semi-dense areas (28%). In addition, the OECD report defines metropolitan areas as functional urban areas together with their surrounding commuting zones ‘to capture the full extent’ of a city’s working population. Metropolitan areas account for 54% of total world population, with the OECD estimating that commuting zones representing 17% of the overall metropolitan population, rising to 31% in high-income countries. In the context of these global definitions, this chapter identifies ‘cities and settlements’ as concentrated human habitation centres (along a dynamic continuum from rural to urban) (Murali <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ward--2016">Ward and Shackleton, 2016</a>) (Figure 6.1) that are fundamentally inter-connected to other urban centres and rural areas as nodes within broader networks.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer005"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="figure-6-001" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_6_001.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 6.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Defining ‘urban’ and ‘rural’ in relation to cities and settlements</span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Key infrastructure is used here to refer to ‘critical nodes and arteries’ that comprise urban energy, food, water, sewerage, health, transport and communication systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Steele--2017">Steele and Legacy, 2017</a>; Maxwell <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Bassolas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Key or critical infrastructure provides much of the material basis of cities and settlements, as well as the mechanisms for enabling flows of people, goods, data, waste, energy (through urban metabolism processes of consumption and production) and capital, between urban regions and rural areas (Blay-Palmer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Dijst <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). An overview of this process of ‘planetary’ urbanisation is provided in Box 6.1. The balance of accumulated scientific knowledge on climate risks, impact and adaptation has been generated from studies in large and medium-sized cities of 1 million or more. While these larger cities continue to grow rapidly (UNDESA 2018), settlements of more than 5 million people contain less than a quarter of the world’s urban population, and more than half of the world’s urban residents live in settlements of 1 million or less (Table 6.1).

class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This chapter takes a comprehensive approach to understanding ‘key infrastructure’ as expressed in social, nature-based and physical infrastructure. Social infrastructure includes the social, cultural, and financial activities and institutions, as well as associated property, buildings and artefacts and policy domains such as social protection, health and education that support well-being and public life (Frolova <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Latham--2019">Latham and Layton, 2019</a>). Nature-based infrastructure focuses on solutions to risk, applying natural assets such as trees or open water, physical infrastructure describes engineering approaches and grey/physical infrastructure refers to engineered assets that provide one or multiple services required by society, such as transportation or wastewater treatment ([IISD, N.D.]; see also Annex II: Glossary).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This approach is based on a framing of cities and settlements as complex systems where social, ecological and physical processes interact in planned and unplanned ways. This chapter therefore builds on the AR5 <a class="section-link" data-title="Asia" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arent--2014">Arent et al., 2014</a>) conception of key economic sectors and services (e.g., energy, water, transport, waste, sanitation and drainage) by positioning these within three major categories of infrastructure: social, nature based and physical (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>). Where adaptation challenges can be responded to by more than one approach, sometimes working together, this is noted (see also Sections 17.2 and 17.4). This approach allows an understanding of adaptation that is not constrained to the administrative boundaries of cities and settlements, but that includes the networks and flows that connect peri-urban communities, metropolitan regions, suburban settlements and more rural places (see Box 6.1). Both formal provision of infrastructure services by government and informal provision by communities and individuals are considered at risk from climate change, as are existing adaptation pathways and actions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Cities are complex entities where social, ecological and physical systems interact in planned and unplanned ways (Markolf <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). The complexity of cities, settlements and key infrastructure (Figure 6.2) where multiple functional systems continuously interact makes it difficult to distinguish risks (Box 6.1). The literature often resolves this by offering discrete assessments for specific sectors (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>). This fragmented approach to understanding climate change associated impacts and risks is then reflected also in siloed approaches to risk management and adaptation financing (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Recent literature notes that resilience planning has begun to overcome this tendency by presenting climate change impacts, losses and damages, and urban processes, as unfolding together in interacting and cascading pathways (Fraser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Eriksen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020) (Figure 6.2). The chapter reflects this change in the literature by presenting climate change impacts through a series of risk assessments, including by hazard type, through indirect impacts on health or food security, key infrastructure systems, land use and human mobility, water flows and on structural conditions, such as poverty and justice in the city (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). In a departure from AR5 we also consider the consequential interactions of climate risks, impacts, adaptation and climate mitigation (see also Cross-Working Group Box URBAN in Chapter 6).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer007"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" id="figure-6-002" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_6_002.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title ParaOverride-3" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 6.2 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>The interconnected nature of cities, settlements and infrastructure</span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The IPCC 1.5°C Special Report commented that ‘The extent of risk depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness of adaptation for regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal settlements, and infrastructure sectors (energy, water, and transport) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>)’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>).We take this statement as a starting point for assessing the risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure, with infrastructure extended as noted above. Risks from climate change are understood as the product of climate change associated hazards impacting on exposed and vulnerable people and assets (including biodiversity). Adaptation can, in some cases, reduce exposure and susceptibility and enable recovery and scope for transformation toward long-term equitable and sustainable development. Risks describe both present conditions and future prospects. Direct attribution of hazards to climate change remains limited to temperature extremes and sea level rise, though we consider all hydrometeorological hazards as systems associated with climate change processes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This chapter also assesses conditions supporting incremental and transformative adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Incremental and transformative adaptation are both important but serve distinct roles in the interaction of urban systems, climate risk and risk management, and in advancing social justice, just transitions and climate resilient development (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Climate resilient development pathways are an emerging concept in the literature since the AR5 (Schipper <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Climate resilient development is an iterative process of systemic change that integrates both mitigation and adaptation efforts (see Annex II: Glossary). Initial studies highlight the way rapid urbanisation and precarious urban housing and land tenure can undermine climate resilient development, while human settlements that are managed to protect housing tenancy and land tenure rights can advance land use planning and social learning while reducing inequalities and vulnerability and enhancing resilient development (Mitchell, Enemark and Van der Molen, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#%C3%9Crge-Vorsatz--2018">Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2018</a>).

How households engage with communities and neighbourhoods and larger units within cities, and how cities (both formal and informal) interact with sub-national and national actors is also discussed, as is the role of finance and community-based organisations (CBOs)/NGOs in the governance process.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.1.4"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.1.4 Global Urban Trends <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-4-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, many cities and other settlements, particularly unplanned and/or informal in Asia and Africa, have continued to grow at rapid rates (van den Berg , Otto and Fikresilassie 2021). Elsewhere, in Latin America in particular, while growth is less rapid, inequality persists. As a result, cities and settlements are crucial both as sites of potential action on climate change, and sites of increased exposure to risk (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence, high agreement </span>)<span class="condensed_italic" lang>. </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Patterns and trends for urban population growth were described in detail in AR5. Between 2015 and 2020, urban populations globally have grown by more than 397 million people, with more than 90% of this growth taking place in less developed regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). The latest population projections from <a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA (2018)</a> reinforce the trends identified previously, with even higher estimates for global urban populations. The 2012 data used in AR5 projected a global urban population of 4984 million in 2030 and 6252 million in 2050; the 2018 revisions project 5167 million and 6680 million respectively. Particularly noteworthy is the higher projection provided for sub-Saharan Africa’s urban population: increasing from 596 million to 666 million in 2030, and from 1069 million to 1258 million in 2050. These figures highlight the continued trend toward larger urban populations, and the particular significance of this in areas which currently have relatively small proportions of their populations living in towns and cities; this is also true in some Small Island States (e.g., the Solomon Islands) (McEvoy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). The proportion of the global urban population living in megacities (with populations of more than 10 million people) is expected to continue growing slowly (to 16% of the urban total, or 862 million people, living in 48 agglomerations) by 2035 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). The size and form of these megacities presents particular challenges with climate change impacts, in areas including air quality (Baklanov, Luisa and Molina, 2016), flooding (Januriyadi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), and temperature increase (Darmanto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Differentiated Human Vulnerability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.3">Section 6.2.3</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">While there are few analyses of urban trends at the global scale, an additional 2.5 billion people are projected to be living in urban areas by 2050, with up to 90% of this increase concentrated in the regions of Asia and Africa, particularly in India, China and Nigeria, where 35% of this urban growth is projected to occur (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). Growth rates are slowing down in North America, South America and Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). Much global growth continues to outstrip the ability of governments or the private sector to plan, fund and provide for sustainable urban infrastructure and this is most marked in low-income and informal settlements (Angel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Rural migration as a driver of urbanisation is discussed in 6.2.4.3, and literature has documented the way urban expansion and the conversion of agricultural land is also driven by investment incentives and weak planning policies (Colsaet, Laurans and Levrel, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Woodworth--2017">Woodworth and Wallace, 2017</a>). At the same time, early evidence suggests that, at least in some locations, out-migration from cities occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Rajan, Sivakumar and Srinivasan, 2020), but the evidence is not clear and in some cases may have increased migration to other megacities (Chow <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). There is also growing recognition that poor planning has exacerbated the concentrated of deprivation in specific locations, deepening a cycle of exclusion and marginalisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2020">UNDESA, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">One critical element of global urban trends which has received growing attention is informality (see also Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019). Informality is one of the key defining features of cities and settlements in the Global South (see Annex II: Glossary; Banks, Lombard and Mitlin, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Myers--2021">Myers, 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2016c">UN-Habitat, 2016c</a>). In almost all nations in the Global South, more than half the urban workforce work in informal employment; the proportions are particularly high in South Asia (82% in informal employment) and sub-Saharan Africa (66%) (Chen, Roever and Skinner, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2014">Chen, 2014</a>). The term ‘informal settlement’ refers to urban settlements or neighbourhoods that developed outside the formal system that is meant to record land ownership and tenure and without meeting a range of regulations relating to planning and land use, built structures and health and safety. Informality is a broader concept than ‘slums’, which are usually defined using measures of housing quality, provision of services and overcrowding. While most countries do not generate formal statistics on the number of people living in informal settlements, UN Habitat provides regional and global estimates of the number of urban households that are ‘slum’ households and therefore likely to include most residents of informal settlements. These estimates suggest that there were 1034 million slum dwellers in 2018, including some 56% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa and more than 30% of the urban population of South Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2020">UN-Habitat, 2020</a>). Informality is particularly important in understanding climate risks and responses in cities and settlements, and also in relation to key infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Trundle--2020">Trundle, 2020</a>; Taylor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Evidence since AR5 confirms that occupants of informal settlements are particularly exposed to climate events given low-quality housing, limited capacity to adapt, and limited or no risk-reducing infrastructure (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Melore--2020">Melore and Nel, 2020</a>; Twinomuhangi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Patel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a)(see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2">Section 6.2</a> and case study). The impacts of COVID-19 are also increasingly impacting high-density informal and slum settlements where social distancing and access to water for handwashing are limited (Bhide, 2020; Pinchoff <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Tagliacozzo, Pisacane and Kilkey, 2021; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wilkinson--2020">Wilkinson, 2020</a>). This compounds pre-existing vulnerability to climate change associated hazards. Box 6.1 expands on trends in informality as part of global urbanism, peri-urbanisation and suburbanisation, with implications for the global distribution of climate risks and adaptive capacity.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation and related concepts of urban climate resilience are also concerns for the broader agenda of sustainable development (Wachsmuth, Cohen and Angelo, 2016). Urban areas can play a positive role in advancing sustainability, but the pace and scale of urban development can also undermine progress in SDGs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barnett--2016">Barnett and Parnell, 2016</a>; Maes <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Anarfi, Hill and Shiel, 2020) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).

Cities can be effective change agents when supported by networked local and national institutions, including professional bodies (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Andonova, Hale and Roger, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brandtner--2021">Brandtner and Suárez, 2021</a>; Heidrich <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2019">Kern, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Farzaneh--2020">Farzaneh and Wang, 2020</a>).

New literature is emerging about how adaptive changes at the urban level could integrate both far reaching rapid emission reduction and community protection in transformative ways (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wamsler--2018">Wamsler and Raggers, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rosenzweig--2018">Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2020">UN-Habitat, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019a">Ziervogel, 2019a</a>). There is an increasing consensus about the need for integrated governance of urban areas within and across regions, so that urban risk management and adaptation happen hand in hand with more general processes of transition toward more sustainable urban regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Simon--2016">Simon, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2020">UN-Habitat, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, there has also been increasing recognition of the contribution of diverse knowledges including local and Indigenous knowledge in contributing to the development and interpretation of urban relevant climate change data and policy for effective action (Klenk <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Hosen, Nakamura and Hamzah, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Makondo--2018">Makondo and Thomas, 2018</a>). Indigenous and local knowledge inform coping strategies in urban adaptation planning and new directions for action (Nakashima, Krupnik and Rubis, 2018; Abudu Kasei, Dalitso Kalanda-Joshua and Tutu Benefor, 2019). Indigenous and local knowledge is also found to shape perceptions about urban climate risk awareness, its acceptable limits, causation and preferences for adaptation (see also Pyhälä<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016 for a review; see Jaakkola, Juntunen and Näkkäläjärvi, 2018 for impacts on Indigenous peoples in the EU; Saboohi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Local perceptions about climate change in turn influence adaptation behaviours in settlements and urban communities (Lee <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Larcom, She and van Gevelt, 2019). Engagement with Indigenous and local knowledge is an enabling condition for planning community-appropriate climate adaptation responses (Fernández-Llamazares <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Urban decision making that includes Indigenous and local knowledge has co-benefits for addressing indigenous dispossession, historical inequities and marginalisation of indigenous values that occurred (Parsons <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2019">Carter, 2019</a>; Maldonado <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Orlove <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Pearce <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Indigenous and local knowledge can help deliver culturally appropriate strategies and local choices for urban risk management through, for example community-based observation networks (Alessa <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), integrating ecosystem-based adaptation strategies in institutional structures (Nalau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), using multiple evidence-based approaches (Tengö<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014), and adopting forms of governance that centre Indigenous peoples in urban adaptation and decision making (<a class="reference-link" href="#Horn--2018">Horn, 2018</a>; Parsons, Fisher and Nalau, 2016).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-6.1"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 6.1 | Planetary Urbanisation and Climate Risk</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-32-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The scale, reach and complexity of contemporary urbanisation compounds climate risks and conditions adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Miller--2017">Miller and Hutchins, 2017</a>; Rosenzweig <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b).

While the concept of planetary urbanisation is contested, for example for a predominantly Eurocentric focus (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vegli%C3%B2--2021">Vegliò, 2021</a>), the concept has reflected human urbanisation as a mega-trend of urban expansion and landuse intensification (<a class="reference-link" href="#Capon--2017">Capon, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lauermann--2018">Lauermann, 2018</a>).

Massive urbanisation manifests in large agglomerations such as metropolitan areas and urban regions, conurbations with unique risk challenges, particularly when interacting with other drivers of vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adetokunbo--2015">Adetokunbo and Emeka, 2015</a>; Maragno, Pozzer and Musco, 2021).

For example, the coordination of planning policies in the Vienna–Bratislava metropolitan region, further divided by an international border, demonstrates that institutional coordination alone is not sufficient to deliver effective spatial governance: instead, meaningful spatial policies required the involvement of multiple actors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patti--2017">Patti, 2017</a>). In addition to institutional coordination, adaptation in rapidly urbanising areas requires understanding how these processes magnify risk and condition urban responses (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Urban expansion processes affect human settlements everywhere, regardless of their size.

For example, in 2010/2011, drought-exacerbated wildfires across Russia’s agricultural hinterland not only led to increased air pollution in Moscow and other large cities in the region, it also disrupted global supply chains of wheat and caused skyrocketing global food prices (Zscheischler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).

Most urban areas extend into dispersive peri-urban areas where urban and rural land uses co-exist (<a class="reference-link" href="#Simon--2016">Simon, 2016</a>) and/or suburban areas which are lower density and primarily residential in function. Moreover, the urban and rural differentiation creates normative expectations at the heart of planning conflicts and constraints of urban governance (Taylor, Butt and Amati, 2017). Expanding peri-urban areas pose specific structural constraints to addressing risks. In Bogotá, Colombia, a study found marked inequalities as more impoverished families had restricted access to peri-urban forests, trees and tree services (Escobedo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Factors such as limited land ownership and tenure insecurity in peri-urban areas hinder people’s ability to invest in permanent infrastructure to buffer themselves from flood events, as witnessed in the slums in Nairobi (Thorn, Thornton and Helfgott, 2015). Building resilience and adaptation via community mobilisation may not be effective in peri-urban areas shaped by migration, agricultural intensification and industrialisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wandl--2017">Wandl and Magoni, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">At the same time, actions to improve access to peri-urban services almost always improve resilience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Simon--2016">Simon, 2016</a>) Evidence from Kampala, Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Ibadan, Nairobi, Dakar and Accra shows that urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry can support adaptation (Lwasa <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). In the metropolitan area of Milan, multi-functional agriculture supports a local, more sustainable food chain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Magoni--2017">Magoni and Colucci, 2017</a>). Since communities in peri-urban areas are often transitory, efforts toward creating social capital by promoting civic engagement are crucial to facilitate collective action (Narain <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). For example, adaptation actions can help to build the capacity of the community to engage with service providers (Harris, Chu and Ziervogel, 2018; Ziervogel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), as demonstrated in parts of peri-urban Kolkata, India and Khulna, and Bangladesh (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gomes--2018">Gomes and Hermans, 2018</a>; Gomes, Hermans and Thissen, 2018).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Urbanisation on an immense scale blurs the boundaries that previously defined cities and settlements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arboleda--2016a">Arboleda, 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shaw--2015">Shaw, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brenner--2014a">Brenner, 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#OECD%20and%20European%20Commission--2020">OECD and European Commission, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schmid--2018">Schmid, 2018</a>; Davidson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wu--2020">Wu and Keil, 2020</a>).

In Medellín, Colombia, a 46-mile-long green belt is being built to stop urban expansion while also protecting urban forests, providing access to green spaces, and reducing urban heat island effects (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). However, large-scale infrastructure projects such as this one require coordination between regional transport authorities and the different municipalities in charge of housing and public services, in addition to consulting communities on their social impact (Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017). Local and regional authorities have competing mandates, such as a competition for taxpaying residents in peri-urban, commuting zones, and different infrastructure investment logics, political drivers and constituent needs. Smaller discrete infrastructure projects that actively engage local populations may provide better opportunities to build resilience across fragmented spaces (<a class="reference-link" href="#Santos--2017">Santos, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kamalipour--2020">Kamalipour and Dovey, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Suburbanisation follows a gradual movement of citizens from high-density urban centres to the suburbs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pieretti--2014">Pieretti, 2014</a>). The development of enclaves for higher-income people that appropriate resources and constrain access to those resources for disadvantaged populations has been recorded in places as distant as Santiago de Chile, People’s Republic of China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines (Calvet and Castán Broto, 2016; Phelps, Miao and Zhang, 2020; Bulkeley, Castán Broto and Edwards, 2014; Buchori <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kleibert--2018">Kleibert, 2018</a>). The appropriation of land and resources in enclaves defends exclusive, privileged communities at the expense of everyone else.

These findings are comprehensively evidenced and do not need to be revisited here. Our starting point then is to assess the science on how inclusive, sustainable development can be delivered through enhanced adaptation to climate change risks.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">As a blueprint for advancing human dignity, the SDGs emphasize the need to consider how to achieve a better and more sustainable future while ‘leaving no one behind.’ In doing so, they highlight an agenda focused on well-being, equality and justice. The objective for SDG11 is defined as: ‘Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ with 10 associated targets including ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services; participatory planning; safeguarding heritage features; reducing disasters, particularly water related disasters and economic impacts on the poor; and promoting resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement plans, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Similarly, SDG9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation, with associated targets. The IPCC 1.5 special report emphasized that there are often co-benefits in pursuit of SDGs and adaptation strategies where ‘well-designed mitigation and adaptation responses can support poverty alleviation, food security, healthy ecosystems, equality and other dimensions of sustainable development’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a> FAQ5.1).

Over two-thirds, 113 out of 164, of initial Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), prior to ratification, had referenced urban responses in the context of sustainable development, climate mitigation and adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2016a">UN-Habitat, 2016a</a>). Analysis of those INDCs revealed 58 focused on urban climate adaptation, 17 focused on both adaptation and mitigation, and 4 focused on mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2017">UN-Habitat, 2017</a>). Simultaneously, multiple efforts have emerged to align the actions of nation states with those of other actors, including the UNFCC 2014 Global Climate Action Portal (Hsu, Weinfurter and Xu, 2017). While significant optimism has been gathered around the possibility to intervene at sub-national level, the most difficult challenge has been to establish a coherent view of the overall contribution that cities and settlements are making (Hale, 2016; Chan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015b). Although meeting the Paris goals will require staying within a ‘carbon budget’, supporting rapidly developing urban areas in the Global South to the same infrastructure level as developed cities may consume significant proportions of that budget (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bai--2018">Bai et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is increasing international effort among non-Party stakeholders to the Paris Climate Agreement to collaborate to meet the Paris Climate goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Data%20Driven%20Yale%20New%20Climate%20Institute%20PBL--2018">Data Driven Yale New Climate Institute PBL, 2018</a>; Chan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015a).

Climate change already interacts with ongoing global trends in urbanisation to create regionally specific impacts and risk profiles. Through demographic change and encroachment into natural and agricultural lands and coastal zones, rapidly expanding urban settlements can place new physical assets and people in locations with high exposure (Tessler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arnell--2016">Arnell and Gosling, 2016</a>; Kundzewicz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Increasing rates of global urbanisation will pose additional challenges to areas that have high levels of poverty, unemployment, informality, and housing and service backlogs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jiang--2017">Jiang and O’Neill, 2017</a>; Williams <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). There is some evidence to suggest that climate change impacts themselves are increasing urbanisation rates, generating a challenging feedback loop. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, manufacturing towns have experienced growth because of population movement following droughts in agricultural hinterlands (Henderson, Storeygard and Deichmann, 2017). The rapid rate of urbanisation therefore presents a time-limited opportunity to work toward risk reduction and transformational adaptation in towns and cities. The following sections explore these dynamic interactions between urban systems and climate change, and how these shape risk for people and for key infrastructures.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Examining projected climate change impacts and resulting risks in cities, settlements and key infrastructures requires the prerequisite development of scenarios which are plausible descriptions of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces, (e.g., rate of technological change, prices and relationships) and pathways <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> or the temporal evolution of natural and/or human systems, such as demographic and urban land cover change, toward a future state or states (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gao--2020">Gao and O’Neill, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gao--2019">Gao and O’Neill, 2019</a>; see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Changes in the Global Enabling Environment" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.1.5">Section 6.1.5</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Climate change research creates scenarios integrating emissions and development pathways dimensions (Ebi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; van Vuuren <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017b; van Vuuren <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017a) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (Riahi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). For risk reduction at regional scales, scenarios require urban-relevant climate projections, for example, downscaling from global and regional climate models of variables such as temperature, precipitation, air pollutants and sea level rise that are analysed usually for mid- or end-21st Century timeframes (e.g., Mika <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Kusaka <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Masson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014b). These data are needed to ascertain likely ranges of climate change impacts within city and settlement boundaries, and to quantify physical exposure when developing pathways for risk reduction. Consideration of current and projected future growth pathways of multiple urban sectors and key infrastructure, for example, transport, energy and buildings, are also needed to estimate probabilities of risk outcomes and damages within and across urban systems (O’Neill <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015)(WGIII AR6 Section 8).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The challenges of managing these risks are amplified by the complex interactions between climate and urban scenarios, owing to the smaller spatial–temporal scales of urban areas in climate change modelling relative to global climate models (GCM) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP); geographical or geomorphological variations in city location; uncertainties arising from incomplete assumptions about socio-economic pathways at urban scales affecting urban demographics, for example, fertility rates and life expectancies or increased rural–urban migration; and challenges in modelling the urban climate and in developing urban climate observational networks in cities (WGI Box 10.3; Kamei, Hanaki and Kurisu, 2016; Yu, Jiang and Zhai, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jiang--2017">Jiang and O’Neill, 2017</a>; Baklanov <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Additionally, carbon-intensive economic growth, increasing inequalities, global pandemics, and uncontrolled or unmanaged urbanisation will exacerbate the exposure and vulnerability of urban systems modelled in existing climate scenarios and pathways (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Phillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jackson--2021">Jackson, 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Raworth--2017">Raworth, 2017</a>; Moraci <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Mitigating these outcomes requires new forms of urban governance for climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and building resilience (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Strong connections exist between climate change scenarios and urban climate-related risks.

Climate change can have direct impacts on the functioning of urban systems, while the nature of those systems plays a substantial role in modifying the effects of climate change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Frank, Delano and Caniglia, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Smid--2018">Smid and Costa, 2018</a>). An example of this urban system climate nexus is the urban heat island effect (discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Urban Poverty and Vulnerability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.3.1">Section 6.2.3.1</a>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Susca--2020">Susca and Pomponi, 2020</a>). Assessing the inter-relationships between multiple systems and a range of hazards is particularly important as many cities are presently exposed to multiple climate-related hazards: more than 100 cities analysed as part of a 571 city study in Europe were deemed vulnerable to two or more climate impacts (Guerreiro <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Rapid expansion of urban areas increases the exposure of urban populations to various hazards independent of global climate change. <a class="reference-link" href="#Huang--2019">Huang et al. (2019)</a> project that urban land areas will expand by 0.6–1.3 million km <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> between 2015 and 2050, an increase of 78–171% over the urban footprint in 2015. Specifically in relation to floods and droughts, Güneralp et al. (2015) calculate that even without accounting for climate change, the extent of urban areas exposed to flood hazards will increase 2.7 times between 2000 and 2030, the extent exposed to drought hazards will approximately double during this period, and urban land exposed to both floods and droughts will increase more than 2.5 times.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This section assesses observed and expected impacts from the main hazards identified for cities, settlements and infrastructure; temperature extremes (and the urban heat island), flooding (including sea level rise), water scarcity and security, as well as other hazards that are either less well-studied and/or likely to affect only a limited number of locations. The data assessed in this section are limited by uneven coverage. Despite improvements since AR5, data continue to be more complete for extreme events than for chronic hazards and everyday risks, which may have high aggregate impacts and disproportionately erode the well-being of urban poor households, especially for the most vulnerable, including women, children, the aged, disabled and homeless (van Wesenbeeck, Sonneveld and Voortman, 2016; Kinay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Connelly <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Data coverage is also less comprehensive for smaller settlements in poorer countries, the locations where urban growth is often high and adaptive capacities are often low (e.g., Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Thus, data gaps frequently coincide with highly vulnerable populations (Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Satterthwaite--2017">Satterthwaite and Bartlett, 2017</a>). Here, even small changes in livelihoods, health, or representation and voice can rapidly bring households into positions of risk, even when hazard conditions are relatively stable (Ziervogel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). These structural limits in available data are discussed also in Section 7 (Health, Well-being and the Changing Structure of Communities) and Section 8 (Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development), and in Doblas-Reyes et al. (2021) Box 10.3. There are implications also for adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>), where the greater availability of evidence on exposure-driven risk can limit resilience-building interventions that focus on the reduction of vulnerability.</p><div class="h3-container" id="6.2.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.2.2.1 Temperatures and the Urban Heat Island <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-1-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Higher temperatures associated with climate change, through warmer global average temperatures and regional heatwave episodes, will interact with urban systems in a variety of ways (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021 Box 10.3).

Within cities, exposure to heat island effects is uneven, with some populations disproportionately exposed to risk including low income communities, children, the elderly, disabled, and ethnic minorities (Quintana-Talvac <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Sabrin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chambers--2020">Chambers, 2020</a>; and see later in this section).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The risks to cities, settlements and infrastructure from heatwaves will worsen (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Leal Filho <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; see also Sections 6.2.5; 6.3.3.1, Arias et al. In Press Box TS14). Depending on the RCP, between half (RCP2.6) to three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the human population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Figure 6.3; Mora <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Zhao <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Cities in mid-latitudes are potentially subject to twice the levels of heat stress compared with their rural surroundings under all RCP scenarios by 2050, for example Belgian cities (Wouters <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). A disproportionate level of exposure exists in subtropical cities subject to year-round warm temperatures and higher humidity, requiring less warming to exceed ‘dangerous’ thresholds, for example Nairobi (Scott <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017) and São Paulo (Diniz, Gonçalves and Sheridan, 2020). It is expected that more than 90% of the 300 million people who will be exposed to super- and ultra-extreme heatwaves in the Middle East and North Africa will live in urban centres (Zittis <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021), while the major driver for increased heat exposure is the combination of global warming and population growth in already-warm cities in regions including Africa, India and the Middle East (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2021">Klein and Anderegg, 2021</a>).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer012"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" id="figure-6-003" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_6_003.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 6.3 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Global distribution of population exposed to hyperthermia from extreme heat for (a) the present, and projections from selected Representative Concentration Pathways in (b) the mid-21st century and (c) the end of the 21st century. </span> Shading indicates projected number of days in a year in which conditions of air temperature and humidity surpass a common threshold beyond which climate conditions turned deadly and pose a risk of death (Mora <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang></span> et al <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang>. </span>, 2017).

It is caused by physical changes to the surface energy balance of the pre-urban site from urbanisation, resulting from the thermal characteristics and spatial arrangement of the built environment, and anthropogenic heat release (Oke <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Chow <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Susca--2020">Susca and Pomponi, 2020</a>; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021 FAQ10.1). A considerable body of evidence exists on how the multi-scale impacts and consequent risks arise when local elevated temperatures within settlements are enhanced by climate change, with specific elements of this affecting megacities (Darmanto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). The urban heat island itself is amplified during heatwaves (<a class="reference-link" href="#Founda--2017">Founda and Santamouris, 2017</a>), but the extent to which varies regionally and by time of day (Ward <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016a; Zhao <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b; Eunice Lo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). When combined with warming induced by urban growth, extreme heat risks are expected to affect half of the future urban population, with a particular impact in the tropical Global South and in coastal cities and settlements (Huang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Section <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Risks to Cities and Settlements by the Sea" href="/chapter/6#CCP2.2">CCP2.2.2</a>; Table CCP2.A.1).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Heat risk is associated with a range of health issues for urban residents, with the consequences of higher urban temperatures being unevenly distributed across urban populations (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).

Heat stress and dehydration are also related to behavioural and learning concerns, with dehydration impairing concentration and cognition for both adults and children (<a class="reference-link" href="#Merhej--2019">Merhej, 2019</a>). Literature on paediatric heat exposure is associated with increases in emergency department visits for heat-related illnesses, electrolyte imbalances, fever, renal disease and respiratory disease in young children (Winquist <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), with less severe outcomes such as lethargy, headaches, rashes, cramps and exhaustion negatively affecting children in school and play environments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vanos--2015">Vanos, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hyndman--2017">Hyndman, 2017</a>).

Such vulnerability of young children to heat is compounded with projected urbanisation rates and poor infrastructure, particularly in South Asian and in African cities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2019">Smith, 2019</a>). There is evidence that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are more <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to live in hotter parts of cities associated with higher-density residential land use in dwellings with less effective insulation built with poorer or older construction materials (Inostroza, Palme and de la Barrera, 2016; Tomlinson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2011). Specific emerging risks for occupational and related heat illnesses are found in urban tropical or subtropical low- and middle-income countries (Andrews <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Green <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is an emerging risk of diminished indoor thermal comfort due to climate change, evidenced by research into negatively affected thermal comfort indices and/or increased number of overheating hours under future emissions scenarios (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2015">Liu and Coley, 2015</a>; van Hooff <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Vardoulakis <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dodoo--2016">Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Invidiata--2016">Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Makantasi--2016">Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mulville--2016">Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016</a>; Taylor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Hamdy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Pérez-Andreu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Salthammer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Osman--2019">Osman and Sevinc, 2019</a>; Roshan, Oji and Attia, 2019).

Most of these studies employed numerical simulations in which different climate scenarios were used to construct future climate data. In hot climates, energy-efficient buildings with high insulation values and high airtightness, which have insufficient protection from solar heat gains and/or limited ventilation capabilities, are generally more vulnerable to overheating than older buildings with lower insulation levels (e.g., van Hooff <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Vardoulakis <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Makantasi--2016">Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mulville--2016">Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016</a>; Salthammer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fisk--2015">Fisk, 2015</a>; Hamdy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Fosas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ozarisoy--2019">Ozarisoy and Elsharkawy, 2019</a>; see also Fox-Kemper et al., 2021 9.7 for building heat mitigation/adaptation links).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Higher urban temperatures result in lower labour productivity levels and economic outputs (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Graff%20Zivin--2014">Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yi--2017">Yi and Chan, 2017</a>; Houser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stevens--2017">Stevens, 2017</a>; see <a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Impacts of Climate Change with Implications for Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.2.1">Section 8.2.1</a>).

Coastal flooding associated with sea level rise is exacerbated due to the significant number of people living in subsiding areas. As a result of this, the average coastal resident is experiencing (over the last two decades) rates of relative sea level rise three to four times higher than typical estimates due to climate-induced changes (Nicholls <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). This process can also result in release of coastal waste into urban areas (Beaven <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Urban flooding risks are also increased by urban expansion and land use and land cover change which enlarges impermeable surface areas through soil sealing, impacting drainage of floodwaters with consequent sewer overflows (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Arnbjerg-Nielsen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Ziervogel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Aroua--2016">Aroua, 2016</a>; Kundzewicz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). These risks are also driven by increasing societal complexity, urban developmental policy on flood control and long-term economic growth (Berndtsson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), including in mega-cities (Januriyadi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). The increase in flood risk from urban development can be considerable; based on modelling of two RCP (4.5 and 8.5) scenarios, Kaspersen et al. (2017) noted flooding in four European cities could increase by up to 10% for every 1% increase in impervious surface area. Risks are also compounded by the location of settlements, with greater risks within cities located in low elevation coastal zones subject to sea level rise, potential land subsidence and exposure to tropical cyclones ((<a class="reference-link" href="#Koop--2017">Koop and van Leeuwen, 2017</a>; Hoegh-Guldberg <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; see also Section <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Risks to Cities and Settlements by the Sea" href="/chapter/6#CCP2.2">CCP2.2</a>) and within informal settlements, where generally little investment in drainage solutions exists and flooding regularly disrupts livelihoods and disproportionately undermines local food safety and security for the urban poor (Dodman, Colenbrander and Archer, 2017; Dodman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Kundzewicz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Sections 5.4 and 5.8).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Future risks of urban flooding is increasing in conjunction with continued increases in global surface temperature (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>; Winsemius <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kulp--2019">Kulp and Strauss, 2019</a>; Hoegh-Guldberg <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). In particular, Asian cities are highly exposed to future flood risks arising from urbanisation processes. Between 2000 and 2030, rapid urbanisation in Indonesia will elevate flood risks by 76–120% for river and coastal floods, while sea level rise will further increase the exposure by 19–37% (Muis <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). In Can Tho, Vietnam, current urban development patterns put new assets and infrastructure at risk due to sea level rise and river flooding in the Mekong Delta (Chinh <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Chinh <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Flooding in urban areas is exacerbated both by the encroachment of urban areas into areas that retain water and by the lack of infrastructure such as embankments and flood walls, as is the case for large areas of Dhaka East (Haque, Bithell and Richards, 2020). <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2019">Zhou et al. (2019)</a> have also shown that for the city of Hohhot, China, the increase in impervious surfaces contributes between 2–4 times more to modelled annual flood risk compared with risk induced by climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Global trends in surface water flooding are increasing, which poses risks to vulnerable urban systems depending on current adaptation measures to manage flooding impacts, for example, stormwater management, green infrastructure and sustainable urban drainage systems (Molenaar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). The economic risks associated with future surface water flooding in towns and cities are considerable. For example in the UK, expected annual damages from surface water flooding may increase by £60–200 million for projected 2–4°C warming scenarios; enhanced adaptation actions could manage flooding up to a 2°C scenario but will be insufficient beyond that (Sayers <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Analyses conducted in South Korea suggests that future flood levels could exceed current flood protection design standards by as much as 70% by 2100, considerably increasing urban flood risk (Kang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Modelling of urban flood damage in the Kelani River Basin in Sri Lanka showed increased frequency of flooding by 2030 could increase potential urban property damage by up to 10.2% (Komolafe Akinola, Herath and Avtar, 2018). Urban flood impacts may also exacerbate health burdens (including disease outbreaks of malaria, typhoid and cholera), which are compounded by damage to medical facilities (e.g., damage to hospitals and disruption of medicinal supply chains), as observed in urban areas of Ghana (Gough <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). In addition, emerging research shows the cascading consequences of hazard events, in this case urban flooding, on other risks to well-being in ways that are particularly severe for the urban poor, including mental ill-health, incidents of domestic violence impacting children and women, chronic diseases and salinity of drinking water ((Matsuyama, Khan and Khalequzzaman, 2020); <a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Changes in Floods" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.2.4">Section 4.2.4.5</a>; <a class="section-link" data-title="Transport" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.4.2">Section 6.2.4.2</a>; Box 7.2; <a class="section-link" data-title="Future risks, vulnerabilities, differentiated inequalities and livelihood shifts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.4.5.2">Section 8.4.5.2</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.2.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.2.2.3 Urban Water Scarcity and Security <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-3-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Urban water scarcity occurs when gaps exist between supply and demand of available freshwater resources (Zhang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

Flörke et al. (2018) estimates that nearly a third of all major cities worldwide may exhaust their current water resources by 2050. Globally, projections suggest that 350 million (± 158.8 million) more people living in urban areas will be exposed to water scarcity from severe droughts at 1.5°C warming and 410.7 million (± 213.5 million) at 2°C warming (Liu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Decreased regional precipitation and associated changes in runoff and storage from droughts is exacerbating urban scarcity by impairing the quality of water available for its resource management in cities (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).

Drought also changes the dynamics of groundwater pollution, leading to increased environmental health risks when those sources are used for urban water supplies (Kubicz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Moreira <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Pincetl <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

Water scarcity is felt more acutely among low-income compared with high-income populations (Nerkar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), and scarcity on top of inequities and political instability can lead to security issues, for example, conflict between different water users (Cosic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; von Uexkull <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Ahmadalipour <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%B6ring--2020"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%B6ring--2020">Döring, 2020</a> ; Ide <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021), particularly when road infrastructures and access to water are limited (<a class="reference-link" href="#Detges--2016">Detges, 2016</a>; Sena <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Scarcity risks may also be exacerbated by human and ecosystem needs in water-short years (Srinivasan, Konar and Sivapalan, 2017).

For cities in eastern Canada, the intra-annual distribution of freezing rain events may become more frequent from December to February, and less frequent in other months by 2100 (Cheng, Li and Auld, 2011). Freezing rain is also a risk to urban populations and infrastructure. In general, higher population mortality rates <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> occur during the winter season, while more temperature-attributable deaths are caused by cold than by heat in cities located in temperate climates (Gasparrini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Chen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Ryti, Guo and Jaakkola, 2016). Winter mortality is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>unlikely </span> to significantly decrease due to warming trends, partly because a range of other medical factors (e.g., influenza seasons and elevations in cardiac risk factors) also drive this winter-excess mortality (Kinney <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). However, the evidence is unclear whether mortality related to cold waves will decrease in coming decades in European (Smid <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) or US cities (Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). While projected global cold extremes are expected to decrease in frequency and intensity, the higher regional variability of future climates means that cold waves may remain locally important threats, including in milder regions where there are larger temperature differences between ‘normal’ winter days and extreme cold events, and where there is less capacity to adapt (Ma, Chen and Kan, 2014; Ho <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). This will be accentuated in many cities, particularly in Europe, by anticipated demographic changes that result in a more elderly population susceptible to cold wave health risks (Smid <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The effects of cold waves on the energy sector include breakdowns in power plants and reduced oil and gas production (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jendritzky--1999">Jendritzky, 1999</a>), as well as failures in overhead power lines and towers leading to outages in Moscow and Bucharest (<a class="reference-link" href="#Panteli--2015">Panteli and Mancarella, 2015</a>; Andrei <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Six major power outages associated with cold shocks and ice storms have been recorded since 2010, the majority recorded from large cities in the USA (Añel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Cold waves can also significantly increase energy demand. A cold wave that affected the Iberian Peninsula in January 2017 caused electricity prices to peak at a mean price of 112.8 €/MWh, the highest ever recorded in Spain (<a class="reference-link" href="#AEMET--2017">AEMET, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Landslides. </span>While geomorphological events (e.g., land subsidence from permafrost thaw at high latitudes or from groundwater extraction) and factors associated with the built environment (e.g., settlement location adjacent to steep slopes and zonation laws for building construction) are major factors determining urban landslide risk, these can also be influenced by a range of climatic variables, namely precipitation (frequency, intensity and duration), snow melt and temperature change. Some 48 million people are exposed to landslide risk in Europe alone, with the majority in smaller urban centres (Mateos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). <a class="reference-link" href="#Travassos--2020">Travassos et al.

In addition, human factors such as expansion of towns onto unstable land and land use changes within settlements (e.g., road building, deforestation) are increasing human exposure to landslides and the likelihood of landslides occurring (Kirschbaum, Stanley and Zhou, 2015). Rainfall triggered landslides kill at least 5000 people per year, and at least 11.7% of these landslides occurred on road networks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Froude--2018">Froude and Petley, 2018</a>). Although the spatial footprint of an individual landslide might be small (i.e., &lt; 1 km <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span>), the ‘vulnerability shadow’ cast over an area in terms of regional transport network disruptions can be a significant proportion of a region, and cascade to other infrastructures (Winter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Landslides tend to occur on moderate to steep slopes, and are thus particularly prevalent in mountainous regions which are also characterised by low infrastructure redundancy (i.e., few alternative routes) and increased impacts from climate change (Schlögl <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). More robust forecasts of landslides driven by climate risk requires (a) more complete long-term records of previous landslides and (b) baseline studies of the Global South which are currently missing from the literature (Gariano <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Wind</span>.

Microscale wind conditions within urban canyons also strongly affect ventilation of air pollution dispersion and thermal comfort at pedestrian level, especially in cities located in warm climates (Rajagopalan, Lim and Jamei, 2014; Middel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lin--2016">Lin and Ho, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In cities, wind risks from climate change hazards can arise from increased exposure from the expanding built environment.

The impacts of future climate change on air quality and consequent risks on human health have been studied at urban (Knowlton <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2004; Physick, Cope and Lee, 2014) and national scales (Fann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Orru <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Doherty, Heal and O’Connor, 2017); globally, these studies have found a <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> net increased risk of climate change on air pollution-related health (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>low confidence</span>).

The relationship between migration and vulnerability is complex (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>), and is the first of the three components discussed within this section. Climate change, as a push factor, is only one among multiple drivers (political, economic and social) related to environmental migration (Heslin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pl%C3%A4nitz--2019">Plänitz, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Luetz--2019">Luetz and Merson, 2019</a>). There is consensus that it is difficult to pin climate change as the sole driver of internal (within national boundaries) rural to urban migration decisions owing to, among other factors, the disconnect between national and international policies (Wilkinson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), the lack of unifying theoretical frameworks and the complex interactions between climatic and other drivers (social, demographic, economic and political) at multiple scales (Cattaneo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Borderon <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Environmental migration, including rural to urban migration, triggered by climate change may ensue from either slow- or rapid-onset climatic events and could be either temporary, cyclical or permanent movement that occurs within or beyond national boundaries (Heslin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Silja--2017">Silja, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A range of specific studies highlight certain elements of vulnerability and migration, including the ways in which slow-onset events affect precarious, resource-dependent livelihoods (such as farming and fisheries) (Cai <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). In small town Pakistan and Colombia, heat stress increases long-term migration of men, driven by a negative effect on farm income (Mueller, Gray and Kosec, 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tovar-Restrepo--2013">Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013</a>). A study from Mexico reveals that an increase in drought months led to increased rural to urban migration, while increased heat (temperature) led to a ‘nonlinear’ pattern of rural to urban migration that occurred only after extended periods of heat (nearly 34 months) (Nawrotzki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). This aligns with other findings that a consistent increase in temperature between 2°C and 4°C in some parts of the world renders involuntary, forced migration inevitable (Otto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The complexity of migration drivers (as push or pull factors) explains why there is little agreement around quantitative estimates on migration (especially international) triggered by climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Silja--2017">Silja, 2017</a>; Otto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), and why estimates of future displacement attributed to climate change and other environmental causes vary between 25 million and 1 billion in 2050 (Heslin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

There is also <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that slow-onset climatic events (such as droughts and sea level rise) lead to long-distance internal displacement, more so than local or international migration (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kaczan--2020">Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Silja--2017">Silja, 2017</a>), while sea level rise is expected to lead to the displacement of communities along coastal zones, such as in Florida in the USA (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hauer--2017">Hauer, 2017</a>; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Migration, including rural–urban migration, is also recognised as an adaptation strategy in some circumstances, whether this is voluntary or planned (Jamero <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Esteban <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bettini--2014">Bettini, 2014</a>). Voluntary migration can be an element of household strategies to diversify risk, depending on the nature of the climatic stress, and interacts with household composition, individual characteristics, social networks, and historical, political and economic contexts (Hunter, Luna and Norton, 2015; Carmin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Hayward <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).

Furthermore, risks evolve due to macro-scale drivers of change such as urbanisation, economic development, land use changes and other emergent factors (Adger, Brown and Surminski, 2018). Infrastructure networks are rapidly growing around the world (see Table 6.3). Since the quality and accessibility of infrastructure services are varied, it is important to understand how climate change poses different kinds of risk on them. Infrastructure can be broadly understood to include social infrastructure (housing, health, education, livelihoods and social safety nets, security, cultural heritage/institutions, disaster risk management and urban planning), ecological infrastructure (clean air, flood protection, urban agriculture, temperature, green corridors, watercourses and riverways) and physical infrastructure (energy, transport, communications [including digital], built form, water and sanitation and solid waste management) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thacker--2019">Thacker et al., 2019</a>). This section focuses especially on physical infrastructure where the literature provides discrete risk and impact assessments. Physical infrastructure systems are often immobile, indivisible, involve high fixed costs and have longer lifecycles.

Climate risks to transport infrastructure (from heat- and cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal floods, and windstorms) in Europe could rise from €0.5 billion to over €10 billion by the 2080s (Forzieri <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Across the Arctic, nearly four million people and 70% of all current infrastructure, including resource extraction and transportation routes, will be at risk by 2050 (Hjort <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), although the design of specific infrastructure may also affect the degree of infrastructure damage, depending on local geological and ecological conditions. Globally, <a class="reference-link" href="#Koks--2019">Koks et al.

The majority of this is caused by surface water and fluvial flooding (mean USD 10.7 billion). Although twice as much infrastructure is exposed to cyclone winds compared with flooding, a mean EAD of USD 0.5 billion is significantly less than for coastal flooding (USD 2.3 billion), as cyclone damages are largely limited to bridge damage and the cost of removing trees fallen on road carriageways and railway tracks. This is small relative to global gross domestic product (GDP; ~0.02%). However, in some countries EAD equates to 0.5–1% of GDP, which is the same order of magnitude as typical national transport infrastructure budgets, but especially significant for countries such as Fiji that already spend 30% of their government budget on transport (World Bank Group, 2017). <a class="reference-link" href="#Koks--2019">Koks et al.

Recent research particularly highlights future climate impacts on coastal natural infrastructure, including beaches, wetlands and mangroves, which cause significant economic losses from property damage and decreasing tourism income, as well as loss of natural capital and ecosystem services. Research on climate risks to urban trees and forests is comparatively limited. Instead, urban vegetation and green infrastructure are most often cast as adaptation strategies to reduce urban heat, mitigate drought and provide other ecosystem benefits (see <a class="section-link" data-title="The Adaptation Gap in Cities and Settlements" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.2">Section 6.3.2</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Coastal natural infrastructure is exposed to sea level rise, wave action and inundation from increasing storm events (See also Section CCP 2.2.1).

Research from settlements across coastal Southern California, USA, show that 67% of all beaches may completely erode by 2100 (Vitousek, Barnard and Limber, 2017). Coastal zones across Cancún, Mexico, are exposed to a combination of sea level rise and tropical hurricanes, further exacerbated by urban development patterns blocking natural sediment replenishment to beaches (Escudero-Castillo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). In another case, beach erosion along the heavily urbanised Valparaíso Bay, Chile, is heightened by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which in the past have caused an additional 15–20 cm in mean sea level rise (Martínez <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Wetlands, mangroves and estuaries, which tend to be heavily urbanised areas, are highly at risk from sea level rise and changing precipitation (Green <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Feller <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Alongi--2015">Alongi, 2015</a>; Osland <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chow--2018">Chow, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Godoy--2015">Godoy and Lacerda, 2015</a>).

For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Thacker--2017">Thacker et al. (2017)</a> analysed the criticality of the UK’s infrastructure networks by integrating data on infrastructure location, connectivity, interdependence and usage. The analysis showed that criticality hotspots are typically located around the periphery of urban areas where there are large facilities upon which many users depend or where several critical infrastructures are concentrated in one location. As infrastructure systems become increasingly interconnected, associated risks from climate change will increase and require a cross-sectoral approach to adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dawson--2018">Dawson et al., 2018</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.2.5"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.2.5 Compound and Cascading Risks in Urban Areas <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-10-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Compound events can be initiated via hazards such as single extreme events, or multiple coincident events overlapping and interacting with exposed urban systems or sectors as compound climate risks (Leonard <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>; Piontek <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Hydrometeorological hazards, such as extreme precipitation from tropical cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms, often combine with storm surges and freshwater discharge leading to high compound risks at exposed settlements (Zheng, Westra and Sisson, 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2014">Chen and Liu, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ourbak--2018">Ourbak and Magnan, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dowdy--2017">Dowdy and Catto, 2017</a>). The compounding effect between these hydrometeorological hazards suggest that the combined impact of these events are greater than each of these variables on its own, and can amplify risks in affected settlements (Kew <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Vitousek <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). These risks are concentrated in coastal cities exposed to sea level rise and severe storms (van den Hurk <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Wahl <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Paprotny <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b; Lagmay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015), or in settlements located in valleys prone to slope failure, such as the 2013 Uttarakhand floods and landslides arising from extreme precipitation and glacial lake outbursts along the Mandakini river in India (Ziegler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Barata <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Cascading climate events occur when an extreme event triggers a sequence of secondary events within natural and human systems that causes additional physical, natural, social or economic disruption. The resulting impact can be significantly larger than the initial hazard (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>). Each step in a risk cascade can generate direct (immediate impacts) and secondary (consequential impacts) losses. Risks from these cascading impacts are complex and multi-dimensional (Hao, Singh and Hao, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zscheischler--2017">Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017</a>). For instance, combined droughts and heatwaves increases risks of urban water scarcity (Miralles <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Gillner, Bräuning and Roloff, 2014; Gill <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013), as well as increasing wildfire extent and lowering snowpack conditions that affected peri-urban settlements adjacent to forested areas, as observed in California during the 2014 drought (AghaKouchak <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Similarly, heatwaves can increase the risk of mortality associated with air pollution (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Other Water Shortage and Drought-Associated Diseases and Health Outcomes" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7#7.2.2.5">Section 7.2.2.5</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Urban areas and their infrastructure are susceptible to both compounding and cascading risks arising from interactions between severe weather from climate change and increasing urbanisation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moretti--2018">Moretti and Loprencipe, 2018</a>; Markolf <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Risks are complex and multi-dimensional, and can significantly amplify the impact of single events across space, scale and time. Impacts are determined by the magnitude of urban vulnerability and/or the interdependence of urban critical infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pescaroli--2018">Pescaroli and Alexander, 2018</a>; Zuccaro, De Gregorio and Leone, 2018). Poorer and wealthier settlements and cities are then both at risk from compound and cascading risks though potentially through contrasting mechanisms. For richer and poorer cities, managing climate risk as part of compound and cascading risks that can also include technological, biological and political risks places renewed emphasis on investment in generic capabilities that reduce vulnerability and on risk monitoring capability to track and respond to impacts across infrastructures and places (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Considering climate risk and managing such risk as part of complex, compounding and/or cascading risks is in its infancy but rapidly being accepted as necessary, especially when considering the wider poverty and justice implications of climate change arising from differentiated vulnerability in cities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Compound risks to key infrastructure in cities have increased from extreme weather (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>), such as from urban flooding from extreme precipitation and storm surges disrupting transport infrastructure and networks, for example Mehrotra <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al.

For instance, infrastructure within expanding informal settlements is associated with deficiency in materials, structural safety and a lack of accessibility. These areas are often located in the most risk-prone urban areas in developing nations that are vulnerable to compound hazards (Dawson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Further, these risks can be exacerbated from complications arising from local versus national governance and/or regulations related to hazard management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garschagen--2016">Garschagen, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2017">Castán Broto, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Projected global compound risks will increase in the future, with significant risks across energy, food and water sectors that likely overlap spatially and temporally while affecting increasing numbers of people and regions particularly in Africa and Asia (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Hoegh-Guldberg <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).

Over time, relatively small perturbations can cascade outward from a primary failure, triggering further failures in other dependent parts of the network some distance away from the primary failure (Penny <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). In some cities, such as those prone to compound flood hazards, these dependent network parts can be dams, levees or other critical flood protection infrastructure that are essential for managing these cascading risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Serre--2018">Serre and Heinzlef, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fekete--2019">Fekete, 2019</a>).

There is emerging literature calling for analysis on interactions between individual and inter-related climate extremes with complex urban systems, so as to ascertain how urban and key infrastructural vulnerabilities can be identified and managed in a warming world (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; Gallina <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Moftakhari <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Zscheischler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Baldwin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pescaroli--2018">Pescaroli and Alexander, 2018</a>; Yin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; AghaKouchak <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020), as well as in managing adaptation for present and future pandemics, for example COVID-19 (Pelling <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Phillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In terms of policy, case studies from London’s resilience planning process stressed the need for intermodal coordination, hazard risk and infrastructure mapping, clarifying tipping points and acceptable levels of risk, training citizens, strengthening emergency preparedness, identifying relevant data sources, and developing scenarios and contingency plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pescaroli--2018">Pescaroli, 2018</a>).

Extending into urban areas within stable states, alienation and loss of trust between local populations and the state can be exacerbated by top-down adaptation planning and delivery; socially and spatially uneven adaptation investment; and in the economic and administrative limits of government that can lead to some places being excluded from formal planned investment (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). These pathways for exclusion can combine among already marginalised and low-income populations where trust in government agencies may already be low (Rodrigues, 2021).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Climate change can be a threat multiplier in cities and urban regions, exacerbating existing human security tension (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Froese--2019">Froese and Schilling, 2019</a>; Flörke, Schneider and McDonald, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rajsekhar--2017">Rajsekhar and Gorelick, 2017</a>). Where conflict or administrative tensions extend beyond cities, adapting regional infrastructure systems that underpin urban life is challenging, for example where elements of networked infrastructure are under the control of conflicting political interests. This has been noted for the water sector (Tänzler, Maas and Carius, 2010). Coordinating political processes is a major challenge even for industrialised countries with adequate administrative capacity. In post-conflict societies, the difficulties of coordination for urban planning are disproportionately greater (Sovacool, Tan-Mullins and Abrahamse, 2018).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In planning adaptation measures in cities, conflict-sensitive approaches to ensure participatory methods (Bobylev <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021) can avoid adaptation being a polarising activity (Tänzler, Maas and Carius, 2010; <a class="reference-link" href="#T%C3%A4nzler--2017">Tänzler, 2017</a>). Adaptation can provide a common goal reaching across political differences and be a part of building political trust and local cooperation between alienated communities (Tänzler, Maas and Carius, 2010). Peacebuilding programmes led by government or civil society are typically concerned with the short-term and framed by socioeconomic policy, integrating the longer-term view and engineering-technical expertise for adaptation is a challenge (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ishiwatari--2021">Ishiwatari, 2021</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.2.6"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.2.6 Impacts and Risks of Urban Adaptation Actions <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-11-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Planning and implementing climate adaptation in cities and settlements can be hampered by incomplete scientific knowledge, a lack of awareness of cascading impacts (and residual risks), mismanagement of actions, human capacity and financing deficits, as well as opportunities for eroding long-term sustainable development priorities (Juhola <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). These tensions can become acute in fragile and conflict affected states (see Box 6.3). It is important to differentiate between the climatic drivers of risk and social drivers that may compound risk exposures and experiences (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2014">Brown, 2014</a>; Nightingale <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020), especially since technically- and scientifically-informed adaptation actions can be redirected depending on socioeconomic, political or cultural conditions on the ground (Eriksen, Nightingale and Eakin, 2015). The implementation of adaptation, whether by government, private sector or civil society actors, can therefore lead to unanticipated and unintended amplification of political, economic and ecological risks (Swatuk <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Many cities are still in the phase of piloting or testing out appropriate adaptation actions, although there is emerging consensus that adaptation plans and projects should acknowledge trade-offs, intentionally avoid past development mistakes, not lock-in detrimental impacts or further risks arising from implementation and explicitly anticipate the risks of maladaptation in decision making (Magnan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Gajjar, Singh and Deshpande, 2019). Maladaptation describes actions that lead to increased vulnerability or risk to climate impacts or diminish welfare. Urban examples include green gentrification which offers nature-based solutions to the few, social safety nets that promote risk inducing subsidies. Whether an action is maladapted can depend on context, for example air conditioning can reduce risk for the individual but is maladaptive at a societal level (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Air Quality Regulation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.4.2">Section 6.3.4.2</a>). It is informed by process; corruption can distort processes and generate maladaptation (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Barriers to Adaptation Investments" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.5.2">Section 6.4.5.2</a>). Climate resilient development raises the ambition for adaptation actions so that it is also possible to describe actions that do not also enhance climate mitigation and sustainable development outcomes as maladaptive (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Delivers on the Needs of the Most Vulnerable" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.3.1">Section 6.4.3.1</a>). This section assesses three broad categories of risk arising from downstream adaptation actions, including interventions that transfer vulnerability across space and time, plans that yield socioeconomically exclusionary outcomes, and actions that undermine long-term sustainable and resilient development priorities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Downstream impacts occur because adaptive capacity is often unequally distributed across sectors and communities (Matin, Forrester and Ensor, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Makondo--2018">Makondo and Thomas, 2018</a>). In cities and settlements, adaptation interventions can displace ecological impacts to more vulnerable areas or directly lead to socioeconomically exclusionary outcomes (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), particularly when adaptation plans and actions are primarily assessed through the prism of economic and/or financial viability (Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Klein, Juhola and Landauer, 2017). As a result, adaptation actions make only minimal contributions to the reduction of vulnerability, as the increased vulnerability of excluded communities more than offsets the decreased vulnerability of more well-off communities. Numerous examples, ranging from the mega coastal planning in Jakarta, Indonesia (Salim, Bettinger and Fisher, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Goh--2019">Goh, 2019</a>), fragmentation of urban infrastructure intended to promote climate resilience in Manila, Philippines (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meerow--2017">Meerow, 2017</a>), exclusionary modes of flood control in São Paulo, Brazil (<a class="reference-link" href="#Henrique--2019">Henrique and Tschakert, 2019</a>), strategies to reduce risks in the event of mudslides in Sarno, Italy (<a class="reference-link" href="#D%E2%80%99Alisa--2016">D’Alisa and Kallis, 2016</a>), and involuntary community relocations in Vietnam (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lindegaard--2020">Lindegaard, 2020</a>) and Mozambique (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arnall--2019">Arnall, 2019</a>) all point to how an economic logic to adaptation can lead to exclusion of lower income, informal or minority communities in adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A specific form of maladaptation is so-called green gentrification, this privileges wealthy urban residents in urban greening projects (Rice <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Shokry, Connolly and Anguelovski, 2020; Anguelovski, Irazábal-Zurita and Connolly, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Blok--2020">Blok, 2020</a>). For example, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, researchers found that adaptation functionality had a positive effect on property values (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018). In New York City and Atlanta, Georgia, USA, research has shown that adaptation investments can increase property values and lead to neighbourhood change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Immergluck--2018">Immergluck and Balan, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gould--2018">Gould and Lewis, 2018</a>). In the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast, South East Queensland, Australia, where local communities have a strong preference for waterfront living, local governments are pressured by property developers to protect these coastal zones (Torabi, Dedekorkut-Howes and Howes, 2018). In Lagos, Nigeria, efforts to achieve climate resilience and sustainability through future city practices risk perpetuating the enclosure and commodification of land (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ajibade--2017">Ajibade, 2017</a>). The exclusionary outcomes of some adaptation interventions can therefore further heighten the risk to communities that are socioeconomically more vulnerable. See <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a> for further discussion of equity and justice considerations in local climate adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Human behaviour can exacerbate climate impacts, for example in the emergence of ‘last chance tourism’, Lemieux <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al. (2018) focused on built cultural heritage at risk from climate change associated events, including from decay or even total loss generated by increased flooding and sea level rise (Camuffo, Bertolin and Schenal, 2017) and water infiltration from post-flood standing water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Camuffo--2019">Camuffo, 2019</a>). Last chance tourism can lead to increased touristic interest over a short time horizon and to precarious economic conditions, which can lead to further accelerated degradation cultural heritage sites already at risk from climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Finally, some adaptation policies or actions can erode the preconditions for sustainable and resilient development by indirectly increasing society’s vulnerability (Neset <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Juhola <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Mandates to mainstream adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates development-as-usual, reinforcing technocratic forms of local governance and locking in structural causes of marginalisation and differential vulnerability (Scoville-Simonds, Jamali and Hufty, 2020). Adaptation policy examples include: Australia’s adaptation policy focus on financial strategies, preference for business-as-usual scenarios and incremental change will not contribute to transformative change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Granberg--2014">Granberg and Glover, 2014</a>); Surat, India, where a focus on adapting industries and economically important assets in the city can divert policy attention away from general social equity and urban sustainability priorities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2016">Chu, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Blok--2020">Blok, 2020</a>); Cambodia, where conflict between adaptation practitioners and local communities and non-compliance with regulatory safeguards led to conflict and potential for maladaptation (Work <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Finally, although insurance has the potential to incentivise practices to reduce risks, including through measures to reduce premiums (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Financing Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.5">Section 6.4.5</a> for additional details), researchers of insurance-led adaptation actions have argued that, since insurance regimes privilege normality, they tend to structurally embed risky behaviour and inhibit change (O’Hare, White and Connelly, 2016). All of these examples illustrate how incremental strategies that rely on business-as-usual actions can further entrench unequal and unsustainable development patterns in the long term. There are also significant limits to urban adaptation (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>) with consequential impacts on human well-being.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Table 6.4 lists a selection of key risks (broadly defined as have severe outcomes common to a majority of cities) identified in our assessment of urban impacts and risks in this section.

Individual adaptation actions co-evolve with risks (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2">Section 6.2</a>) and development processes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>) to compose more or less planned adaptation pathways that can include a range of unanticipated outcomes. This section engages with this complexity by approaching adaptation through the notion of infrastructure. The adaptation options for individual infrastructure systems are reviewed, and in <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a> brought together through assessment of cross-cutting enabling conditions. Interpreted broadly, infrastructure includes the social systems, ecological systems and grey/physical systems that underpin safe, satisfying and productive life in the city and beyond (Grimm <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Social infrastructure includes housing, health, education, livelihoods and social safety nets, cultural heritage/institutions, disaster risk management and security and urban planning. Ecological infrastructure includes nature-based services: temperature regulation, flood protection and urban agriculture. Grey, or physical infrastructure, includes energy, transport, water and sanitation, communications (digital), built form and solid waste management. Framing infrastructure in this way enables an assessment of adaptation that is not constrained to the administrative boundaries of urban settlements, but also includes the flows of material, people and money between urban, peri-urban and more rural places, and can include adaptation actions deployed by government, individuals and the private sector. Recognising the complexity of adaptation and the research literature that reaches beyond individual infrastructural domains, the section also reviews urban adaptation through the cross-cutting lenses of equity and mitigation. <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a> assesses the enabling environment (political will, governance, knowledge, finance and social context) that shapes specific adaptation contexts and futures.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.3.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.3.2 The Adaptation Gap in Cities and Settlements <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-13-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The adaptation gap is the difference between the ability to manage risk and loss and experienced risk and loss (Chen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2021">UNEP, 2021</a>). It describes both levels of capacity and residual risk. Figure 6.4 presents an analysis by IPCC World Region for urban populations and current levels for risk and loss. The analysis seeks to draw out equity considerations by comparing the poorest and wealthiest quintiles for each region and for adaptation to the direct impacts of flooding and heatwave, as well as impacts felt in cities that include climate change impacts on supply chains; water and food security.

Respondents were asked to make expert summary statements based on the data included within their chapters and across the AR6 report augmented by their expert knowledge. Multiple iterations allowed opportunity for individual and group judgement. Urban populations and risks are very diverse within regions making the presented results indicative only. Variability in data coverage leads to the overall analysis having <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>, <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>. Major trends identified in 6.3.1 at least meet this level of confidence. Analysis is presented for current observed climate change associated hazards and for three adaptation scenarios: (1) current adaptation (based on current levels of risk management and climate adaptation), (2) planned adaptation (assessing the level of adaptation that could be realised if all national, city and neighbourhood plans and policies were fully enacted), (3) transformative adaptation (if all possible adaptation measures were to be enacted). Assessments were made for the lowest and highest quintile by income. Residual risk levels achieved for each income class under each adaptation scenario are indicated by five adaptation levels: no risk, occasional discomfort, occasional impacts on well-being, frequent impacts on well-being, extreme events and/or chronic risk. The urban adaptation gap is revealed when levels of achieved adaptation fall short of delivering ‘no risk’. The graphic uses IPCC Regions, and has split Asia into two regions: North and East Asia, and Central and South Asia.

Even if <span class="condensed_italic" lang>all conceivabl</span> e adaptation was to be deployed, the majority of risks faced by the urban rich and poor today would not be fully resolved. This clearly emphasizes the fundamental importance of climate change mitigation to avoid urban risk and loss.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The urban adaptation gap is also found to be unequal. The poorest quintile has a larger adaptation gap than the richest quintile. Reported inequality in the application of urban adaptation is greatest in North, East and Southeast Asia, reflecting rapid urbanisation in this region. Reported inequality is lowest in Europe and Australasia. Observed inequalities indicate that the markets, government actions and civil society investments available to reduce vulnerability and risk among the poor have not been observed to offset inequalities based on individual and household capacities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is some catch-up as analysis moves through <span class="condensed_italic" lang>actually deployed</span> to <span class="condensed_italic" lang>planned</span> and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>all conceivable</span> deployment, particularly for water and food security, but even here, inequality in risk is not fully resolved. Africa and South and Central Asia in particular show considerable disparity in adaptation to urban food security even with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>all conceivable adaptation</span>. This means that even if all available adaptation was to be deployed, inequality in ability to adapt to climate change would remain. This highlights the significance of addressing underlying inequalities in development that shape differential vulnerability (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Urban Poverty and Vulnerability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.3.1">Section 6.2.3.1</a>, 6.2.3.3, 6.3.5.1 and 6.4) as part of vision and action on reducing risk to climate change so that no one is left behind.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Some hazard types and regions show strong capacity to close the adaptation gap if <span class="condensed_italic" lang>all planned</span> adaptation was to be deployed: for example, Europe for heatwave and Europe and Central and South America for riverine and coastal flooding (particularly for wealthier populations). This reveals capacity within the current approaches to climate risk management, but also highlights the importance of resolving challenges that prevent planned adaptation from being deployed and deployed equitably.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.3.3"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.3.3 Adaptation Through Social Infrastructure <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-14-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Social infrastructure refers to social, cultural and financial activities and institutions as well as associated property, buildings and artefacts that can be deployed to reduce risk and recover from loss.

In relation to climate change, it affects whether development takes place in locations that are exposed to hazards; similarly, it shapes the potential effects that the built environment can have on natural systems. Despite this, generally speaking, there is limited implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>), see for example Maputo (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2014">Castán Broto, 2014</a>), sub-Saharan cities (Dodman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017) and Amman, Moscow and Delhi (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jabareen--2015">Jabareen, 2015</a>). Certain countries, such as South Korea, have, however, recently begun to address disaster risk reduction within their land use planning systems (Han <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Conventional zoning regulations (in which only one kind of use is permitted in a given area) and land use planning range in scale from the regional to the local and can be deployed to minimise risks through protection, accommodation or retreat. Protection entails, in addition to allocating zones for protective urban infrastructure (such as seawalls, levees and dykes, and slope revetments), avoidance measures that restrict or prevent urban development (e.g., through growth containment and/or no-build zones). Accommodation involves land use modifications and/or conversions while retreat requires either compulsory or voluntary relocations and may entail buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Le%C3%B3n--2016">León and March, 2016</a>; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). Risk eliminating retreat measures are less widely adopted than other risk reducing zoning and land use measures (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). This is attributed to the controversies of relocation and to the complexities of buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; King <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Evidence from both richer countries and the Global South reveals that conventional zoning is more effective when governance systems facilitate the implementation of land use policies for climate adaptation that preclude negative human-nature interactions and that curb spatial inequity, both of which can trigger climate gentrification and increase the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged groups to climate-related risk (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marks--2015">Marks, 2015</a>; Liotta <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018). Cascading benefits of zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation are associated with the use of soft land cover, green infrastructure and improvement of livability through better conditions for walkability and cycling. This decreases auto-dependency and contributes to health and economic development (by attracting businesses and retail that stimulate economic prosperity and increase property values) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larsen--2015">Larsen, 2015</a>; Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Such increases in property values have also been observed in zones and areas protected from risks (such as flooding), where it may trigger spatial inequity leading to climate gentrification (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marks--2015">Marks, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Votsis--2017">Votsis, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Votsis--2016">Votsis and Perrels, 2016</a>; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation actions through zoning and land use are more effective when combined with other planning measures (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), for example with ecosystem-based adaptations (e.g., for flood management and curbing the urban heat island effect) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larsen--2015">Larsen, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2018">Nalau and Becken, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perera--2018">Perera and Emmanuel, 2018</a>; Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nolon--2016">Nolon, 2016</a>); with community-based adaptations (trade-offs and valuations, i.e., which land uses are valued more) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larsen--2015">Larsen, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2018">Nalau and Becken, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perera--2018">Perera and Emmanuel, 2018</a>; Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; McPhearson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nolon--2016">Nolon, 2016</a>); and with built form regulations and codes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Le%C3%B3n--2016">León and March, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yiannakou--2017">Yiannakou and Salata, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perera--2018">Perera and Emmanuel, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Straka--2019">Straka and Sodoudi, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Larsen--2015">Larsen, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nolon--2016">Nolon, 2016</a>). The imposition of planning-based tools such as scenario planning, flexible zoning and development incentivisation (among others) has the capacity to influence and encourage these adaptations (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017).

A range of evidence from multiple locations indicates the challenges of mainstreaming land use planning for climate adaptation, including in Bangkok, Thailand (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marks--2015">Marks, 2015</a>), Legazpi City and Camalig Municipality in the Philippines (Cuevas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cuevas--2016">Cuevas, 2016</a>), the USA (Cuevas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cuevas--2016">Cuevas, 2016</a>), British Columbia, Canada (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stevens--2017">Stevens and Senbel, 2017</a>), and Australia (Serrao-Neumann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Mainstreaming is hindered by a lack of clarity of implementation strategies for climate adaptation, insufficient funding, competing priorities (especially among professional planners and politicians), institutional challenges (see Jabareen’s [2015] study of 20 cities globally) and the need to fill data gaps and continuously update weather statistics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oberlack--2018">Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018</a>) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). At the same time, however, limited evidence from cities around the world such as the urban regions of Stuttgart and Berlin in Germany (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larsen--2015">Larsen, 2015</a>), Greater Manchester in the UK (Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015), and Colombo in Sri Lanka (<a class="reference-link" href="#Perera--2018">Perera and Emmanuel, 2018</a>) reveals that risk reduction through zoning and land use can effectively protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect. This evidence points that one of the primary roles of land use planning is to guide the development of the urban form. As such, it underpins and establishes the basis for other infrastructure systems such as physical infrastructure and nature-based solutions (Morrissey, Moloney and Moore, 2018).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.3.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.3.2 Livelihoods and Social Protection <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-16-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Understanding how livelihoods, particularly of the urban poor, are both impacted by climate risk and how they might be strengthened is central to understanding climate adaptation in cities and settlements (Dobson et al. 2015). Rapid urbanisation and expanding physical infrastructure do not have a clear relationship with improved outcomes for urban livelihoods of low-income residents (Soltesova <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Municipal and national efforts need to be closely aligned with building adaptive capacity of residents themselves, often through community-based adaptation (Soltesova <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Dobson, Nyamweru and Dodman, 2015). Social safety nets protect individuals or households from falling below a defined standard of living by providing cash, in kind and other social transfers to fight vulnerabilities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Islam--2019">Islam and Hasan, 2019</a>) including those associated with climate change impacts including food shocks. Strengthening the financial and social infrastructure of poor households is a critical component of adaptive and transformative capacity (Haque, Dodman and Hossain, 2014; Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016). Social safety nets are one mechanism for strengthening this capacity.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Social protection, or social security, is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent poverty and vulnerability throughout the lifecycle (<a class="reference-link" href="#ILO--2017">ILO, 2017</a>). Safety nets are intended to protect vulnerable households from impacts of economic shocks, natural hazards and disasters, and other crises. The UN policy frameworks for sustainable development, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, the new Strategic Framework 2018–2030 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UNFCCC, highlight the essential role of social protection in promoting comprehensive risk management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aleksandrova--2019">Aleksandrova, 2019</a>).

ASP has been justified as an effective instrument to build household and community resilience to climate extremes and slow-onset climate events such as sea level rise and environmental degradation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schwan--2018">Schwan and Yu, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Aleksandrova--2019">Aleksandrova, 2019</a>). In contexts of extreme poverty or climatic extremes, international development organisations, national provisions and market charities are complementary where family and kinship networks are weak and inadequate. To deal with short-term vulnerability to climate shocks, ASP can act as a crucial complement to risk management tools provided by communities and markets, tools which tend to be insufficient in the face of large or systemic shocks, by providing predictable transfers, developing human capital and diversifying livelihoods (Hallegatte <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). ASP can also facilitate long-term change and adaptation by improving education and health levels, as well as providing a proactive approach to managing climate-induced migration in both rural and urban areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schwan--2018">Schwan and Yu, 2018</a>; Adger <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Many national ASP programmes are established to cover both rural and urban areas, however, only a small number of researchers pay attention to urban cases (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aleksandrova--2019">Aleksandrova, 2019</a>).

They therefore need to enable the adoption of forward-looking strategies for long-lasting adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tenzing--2020">Tenzing, 2020</a>). Some examples from China show social protection can improve adaptive capacity of urban communities with social medical insurance, housing subsidies, weather-index insurance, post-disaster construction, relocation planning, livelihood shift strategies, and so on.

However, social protection may lead to maladaptation in urban policy when social security, or similar tools (for example insurance) to compensate for exposure deincentivise risk reduction (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grove--2021">Grove, 2021</a>). In many developing countries, high concentrations of poor and vulnerable groups living in disaster-prone zones of urban centres, new urban dwellers and informal residents are often excluded from community-based networks and social services (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aleksandrova--2019">Aleksandrova, 2019</a>). Risk transfer tools (such as insurance) and risk retention measures (such as social safety nets) can avoid and minimise the burden of loss and damage and limit secondary and indirect effects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aleksandrova--2019">Aleksandrova, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2018">Roberts and Pelling, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Inclusive, targeted, responsive and equitable social protection can support long-term transition toward more sustainable, adaptive and resilient societies (Hallegatte <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2018">Carter and Janzen, 2018</a>; Adger <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).

Climate forecasting is constantly evolving and becoming increasingly accurate. Global organisations such as the World Meteorological Organizations are increasingly focusing on new and emerging technologies such as crowdsourced data collection to support integrated city services and early warning systems (Baklanov <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). However, while climate forecasting is an increasingly central tool for risk management agencies, a focus on urban areas or key infrastructure is still considerably rare (Lourenço <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Nissan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Harvey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). The significant rise in urban risks poses significant challenges to humanitarian agencies. Humanitarian responses and local emergency management are vital for disaster risk reduction yet are compromised in urban contexts where it is difficult to confirm property ownership and where renters and informal dwellers are often excluded from decision-making and planning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2015">Parker and Maynard, 2015</a>; Maynard <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Disaster survivors and growing urban refugee populations are often displaced across the city thereby complicating efforts to track and provide support (Maynard <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Existing early warning systems remain insufficient and the complexity of urban landforms makes accurate and detailed early warning difficult (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>; <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Jones <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where urban centres are often characterised by rapid expansion of interlinked formal and informal human settlements and land use zones. In such contexts, early warning services vary in effectiveness within the same urban centre (Allen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020c; Rangwala <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Often, forecast-based action follows linear structures where forecast information is applied mainly for responding to negative impacts rather than anticipatory decision-making and preparation to avoid such impacts (Marchezini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Early warning systems are effective for warning of threshold breaching events including cyclonic activity and riverine flooding but less able to provide localised warning, though capability is rapidly increasing. Probabilistic risk forecasting and forecast based early action are only beginning to be applied to urban contexts and often those that are most vulnerable do not receive warnings regarding hazardous events (Nissan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). There is less capacity for early warning systems in LMICs with key challenges linked to a lack of well-established risk baseline information; accessibility, communication and understanding of forecast information, as well as political and institutional barriers and limited resources and capacities to act on such information (Jones <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Mustafa <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zia--2015">Zia and Wagner, 2015</a>; Marchezini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Gotgelf, Roggero and Eisenack, 2020). Political and institutional barriers to the incorporation of climate information to decision-making are not limited to LMICs (Harvey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). For example, comprehensive studies on sectoral use of climate information in Europe revealed that, despite climate services becoming increasingly accessible and well resourced, there is limited organisational uptake of seasonal climate forecasts across key sectors (e.g., energy, transport, water and infrastructure) in informing their decision making processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soares--2016">Soares and Dessai, 2016</a>; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018). This is due both to technical and non-technical barriers such as lack of awareness and knowledge of climate information and forecasting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soares--2016">Soares and Dessai, 2016</a>; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Globally, a considerable diversity of tools and frameworks for urban resilience assessments are being developed at multiple scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arup%20and%20Rockefeller--2015">Arup and Rockefeller, 2015</a>; Elias-Trostmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). These include hybrids such as ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) (Begum <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).While important advances have been made in assessing urban resilience, much debate remains around such tools and assessment approaches regarding issues such as validation, dynamics in exposure and vulnerability, and appropriateness of generic methods in high-density urban settlements (Leitner <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Cardoso <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Disaster impact and recovery time are strongly influenced by the behaviour and actions of individuals, communities, businesses, and government organisations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meril%C3%A4inen--2020">Meriläinen, 2020</a>; Räsänen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). For example, the review by Aaerts et al. (2018) shows how the limitations of existing flood risk assessment methods (which tend to account for human behaviour in limited terms) can be addressed through innovative flood-risk assessments that integrate behavioural adaptation dynamics. The study by <a class="reference-link" href="#Moghadas--2019">Moghadas et al. (2019)</a> highlights the importance of hybrid multi-criteria approaches for assessing urban flood resilience in Tehran, Iran. A growing literature shows how multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches that include Local knowledge can achieve greater accuracy in risk characterisation and support lasting impact of investments into more robust climate services (Aerts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Lourenço <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Sword-Daniels <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Singh <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Nissan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Harvey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Simon--2020">Simon and Palmer, 2020</a>).

Established non-state actors such as Shack and Slum Dwellers International are particularly effective at implementing inclusive approaches for local knowledge incorporation into urban decision-making. Climate change and disaster risk exacerbate existing problems of economic development, yet macro-economic planning seldom incorporates adaptation. Recent evidence also confirms the role of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in management practices to reduce climate risks through early warning preparedness and response (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="The Adaptation Gap in Cities and Settlements" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.2">Section 6.3.2.3</a>). These practices are particularly important where alternative early warning methods are absent. For instance, Abudu Kasei et al. (2019) show that Indigenous knowledge gathered through observations on changes in natural indicators (such as links between rainfall patterns, certain flora and fauna, and temperature changes) could be applied to develop early warning of climate hazards (floods and droughts) in informal urban settlements in African countries such as Ghana. Similarly, Hiwaski et al. (2015) show that observations of changes in the environment and celestial bodies are used to predict climate-related hazards in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste where communities in turn use local materials and methods, and customary practices to respond to the impacts of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism for middle- and high-income countries, yet is less widely available in LMICs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Surminski--2017">Surminski and Thieken, 2017</a>). Additionally, where insurance options do exist in LMICs, these are not usually available to large populations living or operating in the informal sector. Flood insurance is widely available in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries but the demand and uptake differ significantly across countries (Hanger <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). This financial tool is subject to increasing pressure under the changing climate, with growing concerns around affordability and availability. More integrative approaches are required, such as where changes in the insurance industry are closely linked to adaptation strategies, building standards and land use planning and their application (Cremades <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). This is particularly important in LMICs and of central concern for all insurance schemes is ensuring access, fairness and affordability for the most poor and vulnerable. However, there are some notable examples of low-income communities setting up their own disaster insurance mechanisms. For example, the Community Development Funds for the Baan Mankong upgrading programme in Thailand include disaster funds as insurance against housing damage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Archer--2012">Archer, 2012</a>). Such approaches also need to be more closely linked to existing urban risk management planning approaches where urban livelihoods are seldom integrated and informed by more dynamic risk reduction frameworks that consider adaptive cycles and how resilience changes over time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Beringer--2018">Beringer and Kaewsuk, 2018</a>; Cremades <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Disaster risk management systems face increasing challenges in adapting to evolving risk profiles, shaped by expanding urban areas and changing environmental conditions associated with climate change.

Cardiovascular fitness for example is a root cause of morbidity and mortality form heat stress (Schuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The World Health Organization has developed a framework of climate-resilient health systems that addresses both mitigation and adaptation goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO--2015">WHO, 2015</a>). Universal health coverage (UHC) is an essential component of climate-resilient health systems. In most countries, access to health services is better in urban than in rural areas. However, there remain large urban populations with insufficient coverage of health services (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO%20and%20WB--2015">WHO and WB, 2015</a>) and UHC tracking needs to take better account of inequalities in coverage, including differences in access within cities and further disaggregation of urban populations by income. Thus, health sector investment is an important tool in adaptive action and capacity. Analyses of health survey data shows that, globally, access to health care is increasing toward UHC targets (Lozano <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Financing for global health has increased steadily in the last two decades and modelling shows this trend is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to continue to 2050, but at a slower pace of growth and the current disparities in per-capita health spending persist between high and low/middle income countries, leading to insufficient health service coverage for the poorest populations (Chang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a). Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial in LMIC and will remain the only means to access health care for many poor urban populations.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The WHO Operational Framework highlights the components that can be strengthened to adapt to extreme weather (e.g., health care workforce, information systems, etc.). The evidence is greatest for impacts on larger health facilities (such as hospitals) and there is less evidence regarding impacts on health service delivery outside these settings (smaller health facilities, pharmacies, first responders, public health inspectors, etc.).

Access to knowledge is an important determinant of well-being, inclusivity and livelihood mobility and of driving human behaviour. Knowledge systems include formal educational provision (capital assets, syllabus and human capital), informal learning based in social interaction and customary institutions (including through social media) and public communication (news media, government and other information systems including commercial messaging). There is a growing body of literature addressing the role of information and communication technology in shaping behaviour in disaster response and recovery and climate action, with particular focus on social media use and serious gaming (Houston <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Carson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Stormwater Regulation and Sanitation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.4.3">Section 6.3.4.3</a>)</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Given the amount of time that children spend in school settings, adapting educational infrastructure and programmes to climate change is highly important. This includes not only making physical structures safe, but also providing students with the knowledge and confidence to support individual and family-based adaptation. Several UN agencies (e.g., UNICEF and UNDRR) and international non-governmental agencies (e.g., Plan International) have prioritised safer schools and child-centred risk management that often focus on schools as places that should be prioritised for retrofitting and safe construction, but also as focal points for knowledge dissemination and community organising where impacts can extend beyond the school to reduce risk among students’ families. Universities and think tanks, as well as the third and private sector are key support mechanisms, particularly at the local level and when working in collaboration with local government and communities. They can support the development of critical educational resources and innovative communication methods, as well as facilitate the design and implementation of climate policies and related action plans.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Youth, adult communities, social media and the commercial media can have a significant impact on advancing climate awareness and the legitimacy of adaptive action, particularly in large urban areas (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Climate change education in urban settlements has increasingly focused on enhancing children and young people’s political agency in schools, universities, and in formal and informal media settings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cutter-Mackenzie--2019">Cutter-Mackenzie and Rousell, 2019</a>). However, an ambiguous framing of climate impacts and adaptation, for example around the science of urban heat islands by the media, can also exacerbate local community confusion and uncertainty (Iping <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) and further training and capacity building opportunities such as for vocational qualifications is still required across diverse settings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Simmons--2021">Simmons, 2021</a>). Communication strategies deployed in formal education and social media can be highly influential in exchanging information and establishing narratives and viewpoints that frame what adaptive action is legitimate, especially in large cities (Simpson, Napawan and Snyder, 2019). However, the effectiveness of communication strategies for change, for example from Mayoral offices, can also be influenced by wider political and structural drivers including community literacy or political partisanship (Boussalis, Coan and Holman, 2019). Recent research (e.g., Macintyre <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018) highlights the need for new learning approaches to climate education from school age to adult education. Emphasis is on inclusivity in learning and recognising diverse perspectives across multiple levels and settings, from formal and informal education to wider social learning. Informal learning that takes place outside of school settings, such as in libraries and botanical gardens, in everyday life is increasingly recognised as a key arena for climate education, life-long learning and nurturing environmental citizenship and activism (Paraskeva-Hadjichambi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.3.6"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.3.6 Cultural heritage/institutions <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-20-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The integration of culture into urban policy and planning is increasingly recognised as critical to developing sustainable and resilient cities, and features in international agreements such as the SDGs (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>; <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sitas--2020">Sitas, 2020</a>).

Nature-based solutions (NBS) are actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits (Cohen-Shacham <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Widely recognised as low-regret measures for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, green and blue infrastructure investments and natural area conservation in cities can provide NBS across scales to reduce temperature shocks and provide natural flood defences among other adaptation and resilience benefits (McPhearson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Andersson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Frantzeskaki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Blue infrastructure, for example, provides ecological and hydrological functions (e.g., evaporation, transpiration, drainage, infiltration, detention) critical to sustainable urban water management (Iojă<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Public parks, urban forests, street trees and green roofs, as well as lakes, ponds and streams are widely documented for providing local cooling, grass and riparian buffers, forested watersheds can enhance flood and drought protection for cities and settlements, and mangrove stands and wetlands in coastal areas can reduce storm surges. Despite increasing knowledge about NBS (here encompassing literature on ecosystem services for climate change adaptation and resilience, ecosystem-based adaptation, and benefits of green and blue infrastructure for adaptation), recent studies indicate that nature-based approaches to adaptation and resilience are still under-recognised and under-invested in urban planning and development (Matthews, Lo and Byrne, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Geneletti--2016">Geneletti and Zardo, 2016</a>; Frantzeskaki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), despite the potential scale of benefits, for example, a recent study covering 70 cities in Latin America calculated that 96 million people would benefit from improving main watersheds with green infrastructure (Tellman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Grey infrastructure often damages or eliminates biophysical processes (e.g., through soil sealing, stream burial or altered hydrology) necessary to sustain ecosystems, habitats and livelihoods, where urban ecological infrastructure (Childers <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) can be more flexible and cost effective for providing flood risk reduction and other benefits (Palmer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).

At the same time, concerns about the unintended consequences of investing in green infrastructure for NBS, such as how it may contribute to gentrification (Turkelboom <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Haase <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), create more public use, increase water demand (Nouri, Borujeni and Hoekstra, 2019) or contribute to criminal activity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cilliers--2015">Cilliers and Cilliers, 2015</a>) underlines the challenges of investing in adaptation in complex urban systems (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks of Urban Adaptation Actions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.6">Section 6.2.6</a>).

Cooperation between scientists, decision-makers and Indigenous knowledge-holders can supplement current efforts and ensure that investments in NBS do not negatively impact indigenous communities (Ban <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Seddon <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Townsend, Moola and Craig, 2020).</p><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.4.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.4.1 Temperature Regulation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-21-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Nature-based strategies, including street trees, green roofs, green walls and other urban vegetation, can reduce heat and extreme heat by cooling private and public spaces (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Shading and evapotranspiration are the primary mechanisms for vegetation-induced urban cooling (Coutts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Shading reduces mean radiant temperature, which is the dominant influence on outdoor human thermal comfort under warm, sunny conditions (Thorsson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Viguié<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Outdoor green space and parks may also slightly reduce indoor heat hazard (Viguié<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Apart from lowering temperature, NBS may also contribute to lower energy costs by reducing extra demand for conventional sources of cooling (e.g., air conditioning) (Viguié<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Foustalieraki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), especially during peak demand periods. Homes with shade trees that are located in cities where air conditioning systems are common can save over 30% of residential peak cooling demand (Zardo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Green roofs have been shown to significantly lower surface temperatures on buildings (Bevilacqua <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017) and modelling suggests that green roofs, if employed widely throughout urban areas, have the potential to impact the regional heat profile of cities (Bevilacqua <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Rosenzweig, Gaffin and Parshall, 2006). Community or allotment gardens, backyard greening and other types of low vegetation, as well as lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, can also provide local cooling benefits to nearby residents (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017; Larondelle <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Santamouris--2020">Santamouris, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Urban climate models show that increased vegetation cover results in reducing both mean air temperatures and extreme temperatures during heatwaves (Heaviside, Cai and Vardoulakis, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ferreira--2019">Ferreira and Duarte, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schubert--2013">Schubert and Grossman-Clarke, 2013</a>). Greater density and more canopy coverage relative to other built and paved surfaces increases shade provision and evapotranspiration (Hamstead <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Grilo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Herath, Halwatura and Jayasinghe, 2018; Knight <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). However, local cooling by vegetation depends on regional climate context, geographic setting of the city, urban form, the density and placement of the trees, in addition to a variety of other ecological, technical, and social factors, such as local stewardship (Salmond <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Green spaces less than 0.5–2.0 ha may have negligible cooling effects at regional scales, but impacts of shading can have microscale cooling benefits (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017; Zardo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Vegetation impacts on day versus night-time cooling varies (Imran <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) as does cooling potential in temperate versus tropical climates. The supply of cooler air from surrounding peri-urban and rural areas can impact cooling in the urban core suggesting that regional adaptation planning for NBS is important to maintain or extend ventilation paths from the urban fringe into the city centre (Schau-Noppel, Kossmann and Buchholz, 2020).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">To maximize the adaptation benefits of NBS for regulating urban heat, it can be helpful to prioritise tree planting and other urban greening investments in areas where heat vulnerability and risk are the highest, especially communities that lack urban tree canopy or accessibility to parks to cool off during hot days or heatwaves (Ziter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Planting trees closely together or in partly permeable vegetated barriers along streets can improve local cooling benefits. Additionally, choosing tree species with leaves that have the greatest leaf area index or the largest leaves can improve cooling performance, as those trees have the greatest shading and evapotranspiration benefits that, in turn, provide the greatest cooling effects (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Drought-resistant trees, often native trees, are ideal to avoid high watering costs, though dry or water scarce areas may limit adoption of urban vegetation as an NBS strategy (Coutts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). Native trees and permaculture can provide additional benefits for local biodiversity as shown in study in Melbourne, Australia which found that increasing vegetation from 10% to 30% increased occupancy of bats, birds, bees, beetles and bugs by up to 130% (Threlfall <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), with particularly high impact on native species.. Additionally, planting fruit or nut trees can provide co-benefits for local food production, and yet choice of species and placement is important to consider with respect to local cultural needs and norms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adegun--2018">Adegun, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Adegun--2017">Adegun, 2017</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.4.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.4.2 Air Quality Regulation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-22-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">NBS in cities can help regulate air quality by absorbing air pollutants (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>).

However, findings show that trees can also positively affect ground-level ozone (Calfapietra <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Kroeger <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014), airborne pollen concentrations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Willis--2017">Willis and Petrokofsky, 2017</a>) and indirectly affect air quality through reduced emissions from energy production offset by shade provision (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Certain tree species however can also be detrimental to urban ozone formation by emitting significant amounts of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Decreasing urban emissions of VOCs is an increasingly important ozone mitigation strategy in urban areas (Fitzky <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Trees can also have negative effects by increasing pedestrian exposure to pollution if they are introduced in heavily travelled street canyons where air pollutants can be trapped (Vos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gromke--2015">Gromke and Blocken, 2015</a>). To maximise the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving air quality, planners and managers can target tree selection for species with low VOC emissions, low allergen emissions and high pollutant deposition potential (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), and combine with low pollution transportation policies. Studies suggest sensitive planting of roadside tree canopies can have positive effects on air pollutants (Beckett, Freer Smith and Taylor, 2000; Yang, Chang and Yan, 2015). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Xue--2021">Xue et al.

Engineered devices include bioswales, rain gardens, and detention and retention ponds, and are becoming common and standard approaches to mitigate the negative effects of impervious surfaces on stormwater quality and surface flooding in cities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2014">Zhou, 2014</a>; McPhillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Allotment gardens, street trees, green roofs and urban forests may also help reduce runoff and provide a stormwater retention service (Pennino, McDonald and Jaffe, 2016; Berland <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Gittleman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Modelling and empirical studies show that NBS at small spatial scales lead to improvements in water quality and reduction of peak flows (Moore <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Webber <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Peak flow reductions are greatest for small rain events. For example, D-Ville et al.

However, the magnitude of the runoff reduction service will depend on the total area of green infrastructure, vegetation type and its position on the landscape. There is less evidence of the effectiveness of NBS at larger temporal and spatial scales (Pregnolato <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Jefferson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The performance of NBS depends on the degree to which their extent and spatial configuration in the city are optimised to capture runoff (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fry--2017">Fry and Maxwell, 2017</a>). Investing in a diversity of NBS types may be important to maximise stormwater management and flood regulation, as different types of engineered NBS have different strengths and weaknesses.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Overall, NBS are attractive adaptation options for stormwater management and to reduce impacts of pluvial and fluvial flooding in cities (Rosenzweig <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018a) compared, and in combination, with grey infrastructure. Cities with combined sewer infrastructure are <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to see benefits from NBS due to reductions in stormwater quantity and reduced sewage overflows. Cities where a large proportion of residents lack access to piped infrastructure and drink surface water may see large benefits, especially to human health, from NBS investments (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Where future large-scale upgrades or installation of grey infrastructure will be necessary, new and growing cities may have more opportunity to realise large net benefits from investments in NBS. Older cities, and new, rapidly urbanising areas that lack large-scale water infrastructure may see the greatest benefits from enhanced NBS, relative to cities where heavy investments infrastructure upgrades have already been made. Cities facing climate changes that include more frequent or extreme precipitation may also see large water quality benefits from investment in NBS (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Overall, there is increasing evidence that NBS for addressing stormwater is cost effective (Bixler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Kozak <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Mguni, Herslund and Jensen, 2016), especially in cities facing a need to update current infrastructures.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.4.4"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.4.4 Coastal Flood Protection <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-24-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Coastal ecosystems including coral and oyster reefs, coastal forests including mangroves and other tree species, salt marshes and other types of wetland habitat, seagrass, dunes and barrier islands can reduce impacts of coastal flooding and storms (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Zhao, Roberts and Ludy, 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Boutwell--2016">Boutwell and Westra, 2016</a>; Narayan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Yang, Kerger and Nepf, 2015; Bridges <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2016">World Bank, 2016</a>) (see also Section CCP2 Cities and Settlements by the Sea). Recent literature highlights the value of nature-based approaches for coastal protection in terms of avoided damages and human well-being (Narayan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Silva <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016a). NBS can protect coasts from flooding through reducing the wave energy by drag friction, reducing wave overtopping by eliminating vertical barriers, and absorbing floodwaters in soil (Arkema, Scyphers and Shepard, 2017; Dasgupta <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Zhu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). For example, coastal and marine vegetation and reefs can dissipate wave energy, attenuate wave heights and nearshore currents, decrease the extent of wave run-up on beaches, and trap sediments (Ferrario <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Bridges <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). These effects result in lower water levels and reduce shoreline erosion, which in turn has potential to save lives and prevent expensive property damages (Narayan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Researchers, practitioners and policy-makers are increasingly calling for the use of nature-based approaches to protect urban shorelines from coastal hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cunniff--2015">Cunniff and Schwartz, 2015</a>; Bilkovic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The expectation is that coastal ecosystems can help stabilise shorelines, protect communities against storm surge and from tidal-influenced flooding, while providing other co-benefits for people and ecosystems. However, vegetation along protected coastlines with higher frequency, lower intensity coastal hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#National%20Research%20Council--2014">National Research Council, 2014</a>) may be more effective for stabilising shorelines and reducing risk to coastal communities and properties, and benefits will depend on local hydrology of the coastal region. <a class="reference-link" href="#Narayan--2017">Narayan et al.

Recently, Arkema et al.

Some studies suggest reduced effectiveness of vegetation and reefs for coastal protection from large storm waves and surge (Möller <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Guannel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016) and there is active debate in the literature about the ability of ecosystems to mitigate the impact of tsunamis (Gillis <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Further research is needed to understand and quantify coastal protection services provided by these hybrid green-grey solutions, especially in urban areas (Bilkovic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Additionally, in some coastlines, water may be too deep or waves too high for some species such as mangroves to grow, thrive and provided needed NBS.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Maximising the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving coastal flood protection research requires that cities seek to restore and conserve the vegetation and reef types that are appropriate for the exposure setting and in sufficient abundance to be effective. In particular, planners and managers can use vegetation in protected bays as alternatives to hard infrastructure for shoreline stabilisation. However, the influence of ecosystems on flooding and erosion is variable and depends on a suite of social, ecological and infrastructural factors that vary within and among urban areas (Narayan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Ruckelshaus <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Bridges <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).

NBS reduce the volume of runoff by increasing infiltration and water storage (Shuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2005; Salvadore, Bronders and Batelaan, 2015), and affect the production and impact of flood waters through reducing river energy and flow speed through physical blockage, stabilising riverbanks during flood events, creating space for floodwaters to expand and combating land subsidence (Palmer, Filoso and Fanelli, 2014; Ahilan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Installing NBS to increase infiltration on low slopes and high-permeability soils can reduce the impacts of potential increases in urban flooding driven by climate change, especially for small- to medium-scale flood events (lower than 20% mean annual flood) (Moftakhari <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Source reduction strategies include creating permeable areas such as parks and open spaces, as well as engineered devices such as raingardens, bioswales and retention ponds that help retain stormwater runoff from impervious areas. River restoration can reduce flood peak flow and provide space for floodwaters to expand. Planting and maintaining vegetation along riverbanks, often in the form of parks or river restoration, maintains structural integrity during flood events. Wetland construction and improved connectivity to floodplains also reduces flood peaks. Efforts to restore floodplains are important to create space for floodwaters and reduce exposure by moving people out of the hazard zone. Floodplain restoration also provides access to the river that has multiple benefits including recreation, access to water for domestic use and other cultural ecosystem services. A key adaptation strategy is to reduce streambank erosion (a result of high peak flow) using riparian vegetation to stabilise riverbanks during flood events.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Cities manage flood risk using different types of adaptation and regulatory mechanisms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Naturally%20Resilient%20Communities--2017">Naturally Resilient Communities, 2017</a>).

Cities facing flood risk that do not currently have extensive grey flood-mitigation infrastructure may find NBS to be an appealing, lower cost solution (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). In cities where flood-control grey infrastructure already exists, there is less demand for NBS of flood protection, but NBS may provide important back up, especially in a changing climate that may increase flood hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#City%20of%20Los%20Angeles--2017">City of Los Angeles, 2017</a>; Elmqvist <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

Additional sources of water may be available to replace the water supplied by NBS, such as rainwater harvesting, inter-basin transfers or desalination plants. Reliance on naturally sourced, locally available surface water and groundwater is more energy efficient and economical than desalination or water reuse for potable use (Boelee <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), while rainwater harvesting is even more economical. Increasing the amount of green space in urban areas can secure and regulate water supplies, improving water security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2018">Liu and Jensen, 2018</a>; Bichai and Cabrera Flamini, 2018).

This is particularly true in some lower-income countries where rapid urbanisation is occurring, which compounds existing food insecurity (Satterthwaite, McGranahan and Tacoli, 2010; Vermeiren <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). Land availability and suitability for gardens can be further constrained by land use history, including past industrial uses that can contaminate soils with pollutants such as lead.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">At the same time, investments in vertical agriculture continue to expand, such as in Singapore where private investment in food production is occurring in high rise buildings (Wong, Wood and Paturi, 2020). Not all cities can benefit similarly from vertical agriculture since higher heating costs to produce vegetables indoors during northern winters consumes considerable amounts of energy and may generate fossil fuel emissions depending on the energy source (Goldstein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016a; Mohareb <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Some regions can benefit from more traditional outdoor urban farming, such as in South and Southeast Asia, which can support multiple growing cycles per year for some crops, particularly in tropical areas where irrigation is available. Light availability, soil health and water availability will impact food production in urban areas.

While urban agriculture may provide benefits in terms of stability of food access in low-income households in some regions of the Global South where the climate is warmer, the shorter growing seasons in colder climates will reduce the role of outdoor urban agriculture in year-round food supply and diets. Though urban agriculture constitutes a small fraction of total food consumption in some urban areas, several studies have attempted to estimate the extent to which urban agriculture could theoretically meet urban total food or vegetable demand (<a class="reference-link" href="#Badami--2015">Badami and Ramankutty, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McClintock--2014">McClintock, 2014</a>; Hara <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).

For example, there is a need for further studies that connect solar radiation, urban morphology (e.g., aspect and plot ratio), and the urban heat island spatio-temporal variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Giridharan--2018">Giridharan and Emmanuel, 2018</a>; Li <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019c).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Several tools and models have emerged in response to recommendations from AR5, including models that assess the impacts of urban heat island (Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019), climatic uncertainty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2017">Dhar and Khirfan, 2017</a>), flood vulnerability (Abebe, Kabir and Tesfamariam, 2018) and inundation (Barau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). For example, findings from Kano, Nigeria, reveal that a lack of distribution of certain urban morphological features, including open spaces and streets (both pervious and impervious), roof and building materials (e.g., concrete and metallic) and urban ecological features (e.g., urban ponds and ecological basin), exacerbates inundations and their associated impacts (Barau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Also, findings about the urban forms of coastal settlements, particularly in small islands, reveal that they often experience severe beach erosion due to wave action, sea level rise and storm surge that leads to landward retreat of coastline which threatens their social and economic activities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2016">Dhar and Khirfan, 2016</a>; Lane <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Khirfan--2019">Khirfan and El-Shayeb, 2019</a>). Despite these examples, very limited research is available to offer assessments of different urban scale morphologies and urban scale adaptation planning, including planning adaptation across supply chains and networked relationships with distant urban and rural places connected through trade and resource (financial, human and material) or waste flows.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Interventions in the morphology and built form of cities can contribute to the reduction of the urban heat island effect and reduce the consequences of urban heatwaves. These can include installing air conditioning, establishing public cooling centres (i.e., for use during heatwaves), pavement watering (Parison <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a) and increasing surface albedo through ‘cool roofs’ (i.e., with high-reflectance materials) and walls. Air conditioning can significantly increase the local urban heat island (Salamanca <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a) and the choice of refrigerant has a significant impact on global warming potential (McLinden <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The relative efficiency of cool roofs compared with green roofs is variable, because while white roofs have similar potential to reduce the urban heat island (Li, Bou-Zeid and Oppenheimer, 2014), they can quickly turn grey due to dust and air pollution, losing their effectiveness (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017), although these effects are now well studied and newer performance standards should account for ageing and soiling effects on reflectivity (Paolini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Ageing of ‘cool pavements’ is more complex, which makes their long-term performance less reliable to predict (Lontorfos, Efthymiou and Santamouris, 2018). The cooling performance of green roofs is highly variable and depends on the actual water content of the green roof substrate, with dry vegetation performing poorly in terms of cooling (Parison <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020b). This holds true for regular vegetation and NBS in general (Daniel, Lemonsu and Viguie, 2018).

They include buildings that are adaptive to ensure user comfort during extremes of hot and cold as well as to floods (e.g., building on stilts and amphibian architecture).

However, it must be noted that the cooling potential of natural ventilation will decrease in the future because of increasing outdoor air temperatures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gilani--2020">Gilani and O’Brien, 2020</a>). Increased insulation (including through green solutions) without shading and ventilation can also lead to adverse impacts through the lowering of nighttime cooling (Reder <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Similarly, air conditioning performance also decreases with increasing outdoor temperatures, in addition to being maladaptive where use increases anthropogenic heat emissions into the urban area, and global greenhouse gas emissions if powered by carbon intensive energy systems (Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018c).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Passive cooling is a design-based, widely used strategy to create naturally ventilated buildings, making it an important alternative to address the urban heat island for residential and commercial buildings (Al-Obaidi, Ismail and Rahman, 2014). Generally, passive cooling is achieved by controlling the interactions between the building envelope and the natural elements. Façade fixes such as overhangs, louvres and insulated walls are effective at shading buildings from solar radiation, while complex ones such as texture walls, diode roofs and roof ponds are effective at minimising heat gains from solar radiation and ambient heat (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oropeza-Perez--2018">Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard, 2018</a>). Passive cooling is inspired also by traditional design forms, for example from Mediterranean, Islamic and Mughal architecture in the Indian sub-continent (<a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Turi--2017">Di Turi and Ruggiero, 2017</a>; Izadpanahi, Farahani and Nikpey, 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In addition, wind towers, solar chimneys and air vents are features that facilitate cool air circulation within buildings while dissipating heat (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019). These features may be arranged to address hotspots or highly frequented spaces within buildings. Similar to NBS, the effectiveness of passive cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island varies widely depending on the location of the sun, wind direction and the type of strategy used. For instance, natural ventilation strategies (e.g., wind towers, solar chimneys, etc.) have shown temperature reductions of up to 14°C (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Calautit--2016">Calautit and Hughes, 2016</a>; Rabani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Shading strategies alone can reduce indoor temperatures by 3°C, while heat sinks (in which heat is directed at a medium such as water) may result in indoor temperatures up to 6°C lower than the outdoor temperature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oropeza-Perez--2018">Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard, 2018</a>). More systemic interventions, such as altering urban form through urban planning, can mitigate the urban heat island across suburbs and cities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2019">Lee and Levermore, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Takkanon--2019">Takkanon and Chantarangul, 2019</a>; Yin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Liang--2015">Liang and Keener, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Emmanuel--2018">Emmanuel and Steemers, 2018</a>). Experience in Kano (Nigeria) has shown that incorporating Indigenous knowledge into building design and urban planning can increase resilience to heat and flood risks (Barau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). A review by <a class="reference-link" href="#Lemi--2019">Lemi (2019)</a> suggests that traditional ecological knowledge can provide wider climate change adaptation benefits.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Limits on housing and building adaptation include failure of regulatory systems so that formal design standards are not followed even when legally required (Arku <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Durst--2017">Durst and Wegmann, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pan--2012">Pan and Garmston, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Awuah--2014">Awuah and Hammond, 2014</a>). This can be a result of pressures from clients for cheaper structures, developers illegally cutting costs or regulators lacking capacity for enforcement. Technological innovation can also be slow to embed itself in building norms and standards. Innovation also lies outside the formal sector and can include artisanal building techniques that may have adaptive value. Examples from Latin America demonstrate how initiatives in informal settlement improvement associated with housing policy, guaranteeing access to land and decent housing, show the opportunity for overarching policies encompassing development, poverty reduction, disaster-risk reduction, climate-change adaptation and climate-change mitigation (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-12#12.5.5">Section 12.5.5</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.5.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.5.3 Information and Communication Technology <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-30-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are deeply intertwined with the functioning of urban and infrastructure systems, and are at the core of the ‘smart city’ concept (<a class="reference-link" href="#Angelidou--2015">Angelidou, 2015</a>). ICT is more flexible than other physical infrastructure, although as other sectors are increasingly reliant on ICT, it is creating new climate-related failure mechanisms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Norman--2018">Norman, 2018</a>; Maki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). ICT assets and networks in urban, national and international communications systems will need to be strengthened to enable ICT infrastructure to better cope with climate change, and to enable ICT infrastructure to support the resilience of cities, settlements and other infrastructure. The increased pervasiveness of ICT in smart cities, smart infrastructure and day-to-day living, will evidently have long-term implications for exposure to climate change risks and how cities manage those risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Norman--2018">Norman, 2018</a>; Maki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). For example, even if the ICT network is resilient to heatwaves, it is dependent on the electricity network to power it. Conversely, other networks are dependent upon ICT for control systems, for example smart grids for energy. There is limited information on how these interdependencies, and associated risks, will evolve.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Although networked like many other infrastructure systems, ICT components have some distinctive properties. They are relatively cheap, and the advent of wireless communications has enabled ICT to have the widest reach of all infrastructures. Components can be rapidly deployed or repaired, and generally ICT networks are therefore built with inherent redundancy and flexibility (Sakano <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Components have a wide range of expected lifetimes which leads to faster cycles of innovation. There is therefore greater potential to accelerate uptake of climate resilience in this infrastructure sector, but conversely, this can increase waste and (energy intensive) resource consumption. For example, mobile phones and computers may last as little as a year, cables and switching units may be moved and upgraded to improve bandwidth every few years, poles and masts are typically designed to last several decades, whilst exchanges and other critical nodes can be in use for over half a century.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">ICTs are playing an increasing role in resilience building and enabling climate change adaptation.

Shreshta et al.

Higher efficiency thermoelectric plans offset impacts under lower climate change scenarios but are shown to be inadequate under RCP8.5 by the 2080s; whereas a switch to seawater and dry (air) cooling provides a net increase under this scenario.

For example, low-income neighbourhoods often have less green space and therefore less associated cooling benefits. Even in high-income areas, there is often unequal access to services. For example, an assessment of sustainable urban mobility plans in Portugal showed that some areas have considered equity in their plans and increased access for disadvantaged users including the elderly and disabled, but in other cities this is lacking (Arsenio, Martens and Di Ciommo, 2016). Understanding who has access to what infrastructure can help to redress the drivers of social vulnerability that are central to just urban adaptation (Michael, Deshpande and Ziervogel, 2018; Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Changing land use and increasing green spaces to reduce climate risks and attract investments and job opportunities has increased real estate values, triggered climate gentrification in some areas (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018) and decreased access to affordable housing in other areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larsen--2015">Larsen, 2015</a>; Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Displacement through evictions and relocations linked to land use conversion and resettlement in the name of adaptation has also increased people’s vulnerability (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Henrique--2019">Henrique and Tschakert, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Understanding social and economic elites and their investment in infrastructure has implications for distributive justice, particularly when there is secession from public infrastructure services that has financial implications for viability (Romero-Lankao, Gnatz and Sperling, 2016). In the case of the 2015–17 Cape Town drought, wealthy households secured their water needs through off-grid technologies such as rainwater tanks and boreholes. Although this resulted in more water being available in the dams, it also led to less revenue being collected for municipal water and less ability to cross-subsidise water for poor households (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019b">Ziervogel, 2019b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2019">Simpson, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bigger--2019">Bigger and Millington, 2019</a>). More attention needs to be paid to how shifts in infrastructure are serving the interests of urban elites, often driven by the state, and failing to adequately consider the needs of the disadvantaged (Bulkeley, Castán Broto and Edwards, 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ajibade--2017">Ajibade, 2017</a>; Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Equally, more risk-reducing infrastructure is needed across all urban areas (Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018a).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Procedural justice, which focuses on the institutional processes by which adaptation decisions are made, brings attention to the lack of opportunity for engaging in political decision making and limited representation of diverse voices in cities and settlements, and in relation to investment in infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Coates--2020">Coates and Nygren, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Henrique--2019">Henrique and Tschakert, 2019</a>). Even when inclusive adaptation processes are run, they seldom produce procedurally just outcomes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Malloy--2020">Malloy and Ashcraft, 2020</a>). Understanding who is excluded and included is important (Sara, Pfeffer and Baud, 2017). One example is the increasing numbers of migrants who are confronted with lack of access to citizenship rights and housing tenure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Romero-Lankao--2018">Romero-Lankao and Norton, 2018</a>). Often, migrants are not allowed to formally claim public provisions in health, finance and shelter (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2018">Chu and Michael, 2018</a>). Further, migrants and their settlements are likely unrecognised in spatial or infrastructure development plans. In this context, social infrastructure, zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation has triggered inequity through omission, as some planning process have been racialised and excluded groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Urban adaptation policy-making processes that explicitly integrate multiple stakeholder interests can help to balance top-down solutions (Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018a).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Identifying who is least able to adapt to climate risks sufficiently is important (Thomas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Some people may have few opportunities to relocate away from flooded areas in the long term or to evacuate in the short term. It is also harder for many from low-income areas to rebuild after an extreme event. Lack of housing tenure and sub-standard housing has been shown to limit the ability of residents to improve and manage their landscapes and therefore it is hard for them to enhance energy efficiency (Dempsey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2011). Access to information is critical for adapting to climate risk and reducing vulnerability to hazards, yet access to this information is often not equally available (Ma <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). For example, low literacy can hamper ability to respond to early warning information (Dugan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2011). In other instances, racial violence has surfaced during disasters, with Black victims’ lives being seen as less important than others (Anderson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">When looking at justice issues in urban adaptation, it is important to recognise that the adaptation of one individual or household may lead to maladaptation and negative impacts elsewhere (<a class="reference-link" href="#Holland--2017">Holland, 2017</a>; Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Atteridge--2018">Atteridge and Remling, 2018</a>). For example, the case of an area of peri-urban Bangkok experiencing localised flooding due to unregulated private sector development saw households take both individual (building flood walls around homes, digging temporary drainage swales in the carriageway) and collective action (petitioning authorities, pumping water into vacant land). These actions, to a certain extent, merely displaced the flood water to other areas, or created new problems by damaging the carriageway, creating negative impacts on other households and the wider community. However, ultimately, it was the actions of improperly regulated private sector developers driving the need for this autonomous adaptation (Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">One of the tensions that emerge when addressing injustice is that the global provision of modern infrastructure is increasingly seen as unfeasible. It is unfeasible, both in terms of the current high emissions associated with infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2017">World Bank, 2017</a> ) and the centralised, high standard ideal (Lawhon, Nilsson and Silver, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Coutard--2015">Coutard and Rutherford, 2015</a>). Decentralisation is increasingly needed, which the urban poor already engage in through their use of ‘informal’ infrastructure technologies, given their limited access to infrastructure networks. Transformative adaptation pathways that reduce climate risk whilst reducing inequity require an approach that sees infrastructure as inherently social and political.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.3.6.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.3.6.2 Mitigation and Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-37-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">As analytical concepts, mitigation and adaptation have helped, over the years, to structure thinking and action around climate change. However, since AR5 there has been a growing debate about the adequacy of a neat separation between adaptation and mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2017">Castán Broto, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The delivery of climate change action has revealed numerous co-benefits between adaptation and mitigation, around diverse areas such as implementing NBS and delivering health and development benefits (Ürge-Vorsatz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Puppim%20de%20Oliveira--2016">Puppim de Oliveira and Doll, 2016</a>; Spencer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). There has been a strong interest in delivering development benefits alongside climate mitigation, thus benefiting the overall infrastructure base (Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015). Some of these co-benefits have also emerged in experiences of urban planning, pointing toward the dilemma of separating adaptation and mitigation in a context in which integration, rather than an analytical differentiation, was seen as being required to transcend work in silos (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). Because urban planning needs to carefully consider long time scales, the neat separation between mitigation and adaptation runs counter to integrated forms of planning that can consider scales (time and space) carefully and that are aimed to deliver the sustainable city as a whole (Solecki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">For example, the ideas of climate resilient development and climate compatible development help planners to consider the simultaneous wins that emerge between adaptation, mitigation and development, requiring institutional building and partnerships to deliver triple win solutions (Stringer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Seo, Jaber and Srinivasan, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2010">Mitchell and Maxwell, 2010</a>). While the evidence base for the actual possibility of achieving such triple wins remains scarce (Tompkins <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sharifi--2020">Sharifi, 2020</a>), emerging examples show important developments. For example, establishing safe and convenient walking and cycling infrastructure can lead to improvements in population health, thereby highlighting the close interaction between urban land use, infrastructure and population health (Schuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), while clean cooking has the potential to deliver positive health outcomes alongside improvements in air quality and emissions reductions and through reducing pressure on woodland as a fuel source for expanding urban populations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Msoffe--2017">Msoffe, 2017</a>). Furthermore, active transport infrastructure reduces air pollution and related health risks, and helps to mitigate further climate change (Schuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). These are supported by city networks such as the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration and the Clean Air Coalition that complements WHO guidelines and standards, for example through the Breathe Life Campaign. In conclusion, in both urban environments and infrastructural sectors, triple wins are only realisable through broader perspectives that link climate compatible development to institutional change or the achievements of wider welfare objectives such as those enshrined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda of Development (Castán Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; England <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The aspiration to deliver climate change action within a broader agenda of transformative change, introduced in the SREX report, received renewed attention after the publication of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, which argues for a focus on urban transformations and highlighted that informal settlements were vital for understanding the delivery of these transformations. Deep decarbonisation has emerged as a new idea that regards the development of low or zero carbon pathways as a condition for good adaptation in the long term. Decarbonisation becomes urgent in the face of growing impacts attributable to climate change (Ribera <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Bataille <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Wesseling <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Urbanisation opens opportunities for deep mitigation in low-impact developments, and hence, it is imperative to understand the implications of those opportunities for climate action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mulugetta--2018">Mulugetta and Broto, 2018</a>). These gains are not limited to urban areas. The reliance on connected urban–rural systems for water, food and fuel has led to city government and urban-based businesses supporting landscape adaptations in rural hinterlands with strong potential for mitigation and rural development co-benefits. Water Funds bring downstream urban public and private finance to support upstream rural residents to make land use and agricultural management decisions to avoid damaging runoff, soil erosion and downstream sedimentation with reduction in water quality and increased flood risk. There are more than 30 Water Funds in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. These operate at landscape scale; the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, Kenya (Vogl <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), planned for a USD 10 million investment in Water Fund-led conservation interventions, with a projected return of USD 21.5 million in economic benefits over a 30-year timeframe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Apse--2015">Apse and Bryant, 2015</a>). However, these investments do not occur where communities lack funding or the institutions to direct funding from downstream beneficiaries to upstream residents (Brauman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-6.4"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 6.4 | Adapting to Concurrent Risk: COVID-19 and Urban Climate Change</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-35-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">COVID-19 impacts have highlighted the depth and unevenness of systemic social vulnerability and the compounding characteristics of contemporary development models, with direct relevance to climate change risk accumulation and its reduction (Patel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Manzanedo--2020">Manzanedo and Manning, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bahadur--2020">Bahadur and Dodman, 2020</a>). This is plain at the global level: of the estimated 119–124 million additional people induced into poverty by COVID-19 in 2020, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa each contribute two-fifths (Lakner <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). These are rapidly urbanising and highly climate-hazard-exposed world regions, indicating COVID-19 impacts may further concentrate risk in these regions. Within cities, COVID-19 and climate change risk and loss is concurrent by gender, race and income or livelihood, for example, when vulnerable elderly populations are simultaneously exposed to COVID-19 and heatwave risk. Globally, in 2020, about 431.7 million vulnerable people were exposed to extreme heat during the COVID-19 pandemic, including about 75.5 million during the July and August 2020 European heatwave, with an excess mortality of over 9000 people arising from heat exposure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Walton--2020">Walton and van Aalst, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The pandemic has demonstrated the multiple, often reinforcing, ways in which specific drivers of vulnerability interact both in generating urban risk and shaping who is more or less able to recover (Phillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Honey-Rosés <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2">Section 6.2</a>). Again, this is not a new lesson for urban climate change adaptation, but it is a lesson that has not yet been seen to enter into routine practice for urban adaptation. Two key challenges for climate change adaptation are the associations between COVID-19 risk and urban connectivity and overcrowding. Connectivity has been presented in urban adaptation policy as a virtue, a means to share risk and diversity inputs (Ge <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kim--2020">Kim and Bostwick, 2020</a>), COVID-19 has surfaced the unevenness with which people and places are connected and also the need to balance connectivity against risk transfer, through the failure of food supply chains or remittance flows, as well as by the direct transfer of disease (Challinor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). High-density living has advantages for urban resource efficiency including benefiting climate change mitigation. When high-density living is not supported by adequate access to critical infrastructure (sufficient internal living space, access to potable water and sanitation, access to open green space), this exacerbates overcrowding and generates vulnerability to multiple risks, including climate change hazards and communicable disease (Bamweyana <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Hamidi, Sabouri and Ewing, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Peters--2020">Peters, 2020</a>; Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Where overcrowding coincides with precarious livelihoods, for example in informal settlements, risk is further elevated (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilkinson--2020">Wilkinson, 2020</a>). Neighbourhood associations (a benefit of high-density living) have been an important source of resilience through providing trusted information, access to food and water for washing during the pandemic and serving populations unable to access government or market provision (Pelling <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Here local organising has not only met gaps in service provision, but opened dialogue to vision and organise for alternative development futures. These distinctly urban challenges should be read as a sub-set of wider cross-cutting lessons for recovery from COVID-19 (see Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Where responses to COVID-19 include addressing inequities in social infrastructure, this opens a considerable and potentially society-wide opportunity to reduce social vulnerability to climate change risks (see Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.3.7"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.3.7 Climate Resilient Development Pathways <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-18-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Table 6.6 represents the contribution of 21 adaptation measures identified in this chapter to 17 components of climate resilient development (CRD).

First, urban adaptation measures can offer a considerable contribution to CRD. Second, this potential is realised by adaptations that extend predominant physical infrastructure approaches to also deploy nature-based solutions and social interventions. The consequence for planning is support for comprehensive monitoring and joined-up evaluation across the multiple components of CRD, as well as between the sectors that contribute to adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Table 6.6 shows that adapting key grey/physical infrastructure (built form and design, ICT, energy, transport, water and sanitation) is fundamental to CRD. This provides resilience to a range of hazards, with benefits to livelihoods, social capital and health, and provides benefits for the adaptation of other, connected infrastructure systems. Challenges to the contributions of grey/physical infrastructure, where adaptation through nature-based solutions and social policy offer alternatives are a lack of flexibility post-deployment constraining ability to flex as climate and vulnerability change; risk transferred to other people/places, not resolved; negative ecological consequences; and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> of targeting marginality and inequality.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The significance of a CRD lens for the evaluation of adaptation strategy can be seen in approaches to riverine and coastal flooding. This viewpoint brings physical (e.g., embankments and defenses), nature-based (e.g., mangrove stands) and social policy (livelihood and social protection) options together. The benefits of physical infrastructure interventions for strengthening existing livelihoods and protecting health, for being deployable at scale and supporting other infrastructures to adapt are recognised and set these against challenges including hazard generation and risk transfer, limited flexibility, ecological harm, carbon costs and an undermining of social inclusion and accountability. Final evaluations will be determined by individual contexts, raising the importance of comprehensive monitoring of existing urban systems adaptation interventions and their association with ongoing development processes and outcomes (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The most consistent limit for all urban systems infrastructure types is in risk transfer. Current adaptation approaches in cities, settlements and key infrastructure have a tendency to move risk from one sector or place to others. With the exception of social infrastructure, the observed contribution of adaptation to social transformation is also limited. There are consequences for equity and sustainability as the impacts of climate change increase, and implications for evaluation and planning to work across adaptation interventions and connect with social and environmental policy and practice.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="6.4"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">6.4 Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-5-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This section assesses the effectiveness of efforts to create enabling conditions for adaptation. New policy innovations such as National Urban Policies are emerging to address the multi-level governance demands of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2020">UN-Habitat, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kinyanjui--2020">Kinyanjui, 2020</a>). There is no one-size-fits-all approach to deliver adaptation that will fit every case, because the local conditions of implementation bear a strong influence on adaptation’s feasibility and impacts (Archer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Ways to foster adequate enabling conditions for adaptation are well-documented (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a> Ch.4). These often include integrated planning, multi-agency working and multi-scale and sector action. Existing techniques can be shared and new innovations taken up (Maxwell <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation in urban areas and settlements can be <span class="condensed_italic" lang>incremental</span> (when it addresses the causes of problems but without fundamentally changing the social and political structures that drive it, for example through planning or new regulations), <span class="condensed_italic" lang>reformist </span> (when it changes the features that cause problems but without fundamentally changing the structures) or <span class="condensed_italic" lang>transformative</span> (when it addresses fundamental systems attributes and outcomes such as reducing inequality in political and socioeconomic structures or enhancing well-being [Mendizabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rosenzweig--2018">Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018</a> ] which change the situation completely) (Heikkinen, Ylä-Anttila and Juhola, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2020">Roberts and Pelling, 2020</a>; O’Brien, Selboe and Hayward, 2018). In the context of the SGDs mission to leave-no-one behind, transformative adaptation addresses fundamental systems’ functions to enable enhanced social justice and socio-ecological well-being. Incremental adaptation actions seek to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation that seeks only to defend existing development status will not contribute to enhanced well-being and is not transformative, even if fundamental infrastructure engineering or legislative systems are changed to maintain the status quo in the face of increasing risk (Mendizabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">City populations and non-state actors, together with local and regional governments, can play an essential role in creating enabling conditions for action, including, for example, civil society mobilising concerns of marginalised voices and future generations, as indicated in the worldwide student mobilisations against climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wood--2019">Wood, 2019</a>; Maor, Tosun and Jordan, 2017; Cloutier, Papin and Bizier, 2018; Prendergast <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021), which may then be prioritised by local and regional governments. National governments also play a crucial role, for example in facilitating resources and finance for urban adaptation actions, alongside financial organisations and the business sector (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Financing Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.5">Section 6.4.5</a>). This section starts assessing adaptation experiences in cities, settlements and infrastructures since the AR5, before reviewing evidence of how to foster enabling conditions for adaptation through institutionalisation, governance capacity, finance, evaluation and social learning.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.4.1"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.4.1 Adaptation Experiences in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-19-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, there is increasing evidence that successful adaptation to climate change is context-specific and responsive to the particular needs of urban locations. This section assesses the contributions of key urban actors, local government, civil society and the local private sector, in enabling adaptation. Wider influences from national government cross cut this and are discussed with the role of international agencies, and finance which is assessed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Financing Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.5">Section 6.4.5</a>.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The literature on the governance of adaptation has grown since the AR5, though with few cases from cities and settlements in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and former USSR countries. Potential reasons for the continued lack of studies in these areas include the centralised character of decision making systems in countries in these regions and the early stage of adaptation planning in these urban areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clar--2019">Clar, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2019">Mitchell and Laycock, 2019</a>; Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Flexible institutions that allow for both top-down and bottom-up action can bring capacities together from across levels of government and actors within a settlement (Sharifi and Yamagata, 2017). Predominant planning and capacity-building strategies, however, lack the flexibility to address the needs of a rapidly changing environment (Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2017">Dhar and Khirfan, 2017</a>; Juhola, 2016). Efforts to adapt to new challenges may have to speed up. This is especially true in urban areas and settlements with lower levels of development and experiencing rapid urbanisation, growing inequality and exposure to multiple hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dulal--2019">Dulal, 2019</a>; Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Solecki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Even within cities that share similar characteristics, there are considerable differences in the level of investment in adaptation (Georgeson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). There is also a danger that uncoordinated actions for climate change mitigation and adaptation may constrain future adaptation opportunities or create maladaptation (Juhola <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). The evidence emerging since the AR5 suggests that institutional change can be accelerated by closer collaboration between the diverse actors and deployment of the diverse approaches that can deliver adaptation.</p><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.1.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.1.1 Experiences of Adaptation Action in Sub-national Governments <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-38-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The assessment of cases of local adaptation demonstrates that most urban adaptation is led by local governments (although the local government is also a heterogeneous category and local governance arrangements may vary across administrative and political contexts) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Amundsen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Lesnikowski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Local government reform at different levels can improve local adaptation, whether this is by strengthening specific teams or building cross-departmental linkages (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Paterson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shi--2019">Shi, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wamsler--2018">Wamsler and Raggers, 2018</a>). Adaptation success often depends on having political champions driving the adaptation agenda alongside measures such as access to a knowledge base, resources at hand, political stability and the presence of dense social networks that can be supported through local government reform (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Aligning adaptation objectives with other potential benefits of sustainable development also supports adaptation. Specifically, policies and plans that link adaptation to the objectives of Agenda 2030 supports action at the local level (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2016b">UN-Habitat, 2016b</a>). Showing the economic benefits of adaptation is a strategy for local institutions to gain support for adaptation action. For example, local governments in Surat, Indore and Bhubaneswar in India linked adaptation to local development needs in experiments that facilitated accessing human and finance resources, at the local, national and international levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2016">Chu, 2016</a>). However, linking adaptation to co-benefits may also divide efforts and reduce the effectiveness of adaptation actions. For example, urban land use planning and management in Ambo town, Ethiopia, resulted in the implementation of urban greening projects, but these projects did not directly address the climate-related disaster risks affecting the settlement, including urban flooding, water stress, water shortages, increased urban heat, wind and dust storms (Ogato <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Multi-level governance measures that support local governments can foster robust adaptation approaches and address risks and vulnerabilities across scales (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Westman, Broto and Huang, 2019; Hardoy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Romero-Lankao--2015">Romero-Lankao and Hardoy, 2015</a>). Effective action by local government requires national government’s support (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Araos--2017">Araos et al. (2017)</a> documents the case of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a national plan prioritises measures for protecting coasts and agricultural production. In this context, the local government has minimal access to human and financial resources. Without national support, the local government struggles to coordinate action among different stakeholders. National urban adaptation directives can influence municipal governments’ action and planning, but evidence suggests that national policy alone is not sufficient to deliver action on the ground without understanding local conditions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Archer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Lehmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There are barriers for municipal adaptation plans to deliver effective adaptation outcomes and implemented actions often diverge from plans (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks for Adaptation Used in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.6">Section 6.4.6</a>). For example, a comparison of adaptation plans and budget expenditures of six metropolitan cities in South Korea between 2012 and 2016 showed that the implementation of adaptation programmes diverged substantially from the original plans, both in terms of total and sector-specific spending (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2018">Lee and Kim, 2018</a>). Often, a focus on institutional change and reform limits attention to more practical aspects of adaptation that improve communities’ resilience (Castán Broto and Westman, 2020). Adaptation actions, even where financed effectively, do not always deliver positive outcomes (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Woodruff--2016">Woodruff and Stults, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Uittenbroek--2016">Uittenbroek, 2016</a>; Aguiar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018a; Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019b; Campello Torres <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021) (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Transformations" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.7">Section 6.4.7</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.1.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.1.2 The Role of Non-State Actors in Local Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-39-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There are multiple actors, other than local governments, that can deliver adaptation action, including businesses, not for profit organisations and trade unions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>)<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> (Giordano <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Eakin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).

Non-state actors are particularly important in enabling adaptation by linking government agencies with low-income and marginalised communities, including those living in informal settlements (Kuyper, Linnér and Schroeder, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Khosla--2019">Khosla and Bhardwaj, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, civil society and private actors have emerged as core knowledge holders and drivers of experimentation, even succeeding in changing public policy in the process (Klein, Juhola and Landauer, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#McKnight--2016">McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mees--2017">Mees, 2017</a>).

Many community based responses to climate impacts represent coping strategies developed within households with a small effect on adaptation capacities beyond incremental improvements. Residents adopt private coping strategies to reduce exposure to and the impacts of heat, floods, flash floods, landslides, storms and diseases on their lives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hambati--2018">Hambati and Yengoh, 2018</a>). These coping strategies include the construction of physical protection against flooding, reforestation, the construction of terraces, flood diversion measures and interventions to protect houses (such as raised doorsteps or use of sandbags and adoption of building techniques for making homes resilient to storms and landslides), ventilation of houses, urban agriculture and redefinition of daily practices and livelihoods (Navarro <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Malabayabas--2017">Malabayabas and Baconguis, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Apreda--2016">Apreda, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Andrade--2020">de Andrade and Szlafsztein, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sahay--2018">Sahay, 2018</a>; Bausch, Eakin and Lerner, 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Individual coping strategies are generally ineffective in reducing extreme risks and they rarely address the underlying structural causes of vulnerability (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sahay--2018">Sahay, 2018</a>; Rözer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Jay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).

Community based adaptation can be effective at different scales, whether this is to manage transboundary issues (Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017), support the replication of local solutions (Danière <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), increase the uptake of adaptation measures (Liang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017) or inform the design of more effective policies for resilience (Berquist, Daniere and Drummond, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Odemerho--2015">Odemerho, 2015</a>). Community action may be mediated by NGOs or third sector organisations who play a coordinating or enabling role, particularly where other local government mechanisms are absent.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.1.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.1.3 The Role of the Private Sector in Local Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-40-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is weak evidence of private sector involvement in urban adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pauw--2015">Pauw, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Heurkens--2016">Heurkens, 2016</a>). The absence of private sector investment in adaptation is particularly visible in rapidly urbanising countries (Nagendra <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Business continuity describing private sector preparedness notes that firms underestimate the impacts of climate risks on their business models (Goldstein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Forino--2021">Forino and von Meding, 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Korber--2017">Korber and McNaughton, 2017</a>; Crick <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b). There is little research on how businesses can play a leading role in urban adaptation (Klein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). A global assessment of the private sector’s role in urban adaptation using data from 402 cities shows that most adaptation projects focus on the public sector and do not address private sector concerns or local people’s participation (Klein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Recorded private sector action is recognised through partnerships and participation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Peterson--2017">Peterson and Hughes, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hughes--2018">Hughes and Peterson, 2018</a>). There are a few examples of studies of private sector-led adaptation action which adopts a national focus (Crick <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018a; Crick <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b). This lack of evidence contrasts with a well-developed body of literature on private sector-led mitigation (Averchenkova <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Businesses have an essential role in urban adaptation actions, through the collective formulation of adaptation strategies, the provision of critical adaptive interventions and collaboration in partnerships. Businesses in the property sector, such as real estate developers, are on the frontline of climate change impacts but display differing attitudes toward climate adaptation. A study of property businesses in cities in Australia (Taylor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2012) showed that speeding up planning approval processes facilitated adaptation actions, and joint private–public decision-making was the preferred mode of governance for responding to climate concerns. Property businesses in cities in Sweden had a limited and reactive engagement in climate issues and resisted regulation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Storbj%C3%B6rk--2018">Storbjörk et al., 2018</a>). Corporate, private sector interventions in urban risk reduction more broadly remain limited, with a mix of public and private responsibility for planning, implementing and maintaining adaptations in the built environment, and yet limited engagement of private sector actors in providing healthcare measures for heat prevention (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mees--2017">Mees, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is little published literature documenting the heterogeneity of business and the private sector’s responses to climate impacts (Linnenluecke, Birt and Griffiths, 2015; Doh, Tashman and Benischke, 2019). Firms have varying abilities to introduce climate adaptation measures related to staff availability, levels of awareness, perceptions of responsibility and duration of contracts (short-term projects implies less interest in adaptation outcomes) (Shearer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). The impact of COVID-19 has serious but uncertain implications for both access to finances for sustainable development by LMICs and sub-national governments, and the possibility of stimulating maladaptive infrastructure and policy responses (OECD, 2020; Sovacool, Del Rio and Griffiths, 2020). The response of businesses to disasters influences the resilience in the communities in which they operate (<a class="reference-link" href="#McKnight--2016">McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Linnenluecke--2017">Linnenluecke and McKnight, 2017</a>). However, at the same time there is a growing literature that warns against the conflict interests that businesses may have in their adaptation strategies. For example, real estate responses to flooding have led to processes of climate gentrification, whereby lower income populations are displaced toward higher risk areas which stablishes racialised and class-based patterns of inequality of exposure to risk, with hard evidence rapidly growing specially in US cities (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018a; Shokry, Connolly and Anguelovski, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#De%20Koning--2020">De Koning and Filatova, 2020</a>; Aune, Gesch and Smith, 2020). Private-sector participation in adaptation solutions depend on having mechanisms to enable transparency and open reporting on the nature of support and the solutions proposed. For example, businesses adopting ‘community-centric’ disaster management strategies can assist local recovery efforts by protecting employment, provision of emergency supplies and participation in reparations (<a class="reference-link" href="#McKnight--2016">McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2016</a>). Private sector actors engaged in community climate responses can play a role in funding and managing programmes that address public health and education concerns. The potential of ecopreneurship, social enterprises, cooperatives and other sustainability-oriented business models (Schaltegger, Hansen and Lüdeke-Freund, 2016; Lopes <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Battaglia, Gragnani and Annesi, 2020) for urban adaptation remains under-explored in the literature on urban climate governance.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The private sector also constitutes a key stakeholder group involved in collaborative processes to develop adaptation strategies. The inclusion of private sector actors in deliberative policy-making processes in urban adaptation can lead to higher procedural legitimacy levels, as witnessed in Rotterdam’s case (Mees, Driessen and Runhaar, 2014). Rotterdam has created an institutional environment that favours eco-innovation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huang-Lachmann--2016">Huang-Lachmann and Lovett, 2016</a>). The municipal government works directly with the private sector to enhance protection against flooding constructing a marketing strategy around a ‘floating city’ concept. A ‘floating housing’ market has expanded, with benefits for the local real estate and construction industries and knowledge-exporting businesses that provide consultation expertise, delta technologies and architectural models. Nevertheless, these new trends raise new governance challenges to deliver adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There are obstacles associated with reconciling private sector interests with public priorities and justice agendas in local climate programmes. The involvement of the private sector in adaptation actions may lead to the appropriation of land and natural resources, and to the exclusion of vulnerable populations (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rumbach--2017">Rumbach, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Scoppetta--2016">Scoppetta, 2016</a>) (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Limits of Adaptation Capacity at the Institutional Level" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.4">Section 6.4.4.2</a>). Navigating the inclusion of businesses in urban planning processes requires local authorities to engage in ongoing negotiations, to reflect on constantly shifting power balances and to move delicately between the role of regulator and facilitator in the process of defining and maintaining long-term objectives (Storbjörk, Hjerpe and Glaas, 2019b; Storbjörk, Hjerpe and Glaas, 2019a).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.1.4"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.1.4 Partnerships for Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-41-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Multi-level governance remains an influential paradigm that recognises government institutions’ influence at different scales and the diversification of actors intervening in public issues from the private sector and civil society (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Establishing linkages between multiple organisations can help deliver coordinated action. Multi-level governance includes mechanisms for multiple actors to engage in local adaptation strategies through collaborative processes of planning, learning, experimentation, capacity building, construction of coalitions and communication channels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barton--2013">Barton, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jaglin--2013">Jaglin, 2013</a>; Reed <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Restemeyer, van den Brink and Woltjer, 2017; Melica <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Many of these studies directly focus on institutional arrangements that facilitate interaction between communities and civil society, experts, government representatives, firms and international organisations.

Multi-level governance is particularly important to deliver adaptation at the metropolitan scale, that require coordinating actions across different institutions in inter-municipal institutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lundqvist--2016">Lundqvist, 2016</a>). Gaps in knowledge remain regarding the effectiveness of multi-level governance actions in different contexts and the extent to which multi-level governance strategies transfer the brunt of responsibility for adaptation action to less-resourced local governments (Hale <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Public–private partnerships are increasingly relevant for collaborative development of urban adaptation (Klein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Partnerships can deliver infrastructure, coordinate policy and support learning. The main limitation of partnerships is scale, as partnership action is usually limited to discrete projects or objectives. Partnerships tend to be linked to reactive (rather than proactive) adaptation projects and the deviation of objectives away from adaptation concerns (Harman, Taylor and Lane, 2015). Partnerships can support capacity building in public and private organisations and facilitate networking efforts that extend beyond the private sector to communities and NGOs (Bauer and Steurer, 2014; Castán Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Public actors can benefit from the private sector’s innovation and implementation capacity, and businesses can de-risk investments. Still, partnerships can also strengthen the ideologies of growth and managerialism within the operations of the local government (Taylor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2012). Reconciling divergent norms and routines within public and private organisations remains one of the challenges to establishing successful public–private partnerships for adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lund--2018">Lund, 2018</a>). Administrative and political culture influences the nature of interactions between public and private sector actors in urban adaptation agendas (Bauer and Steurer, 2014), with negative consequences such as the imposition of vertical chains of commands on horizontal collaborations, and the need to formalise contractual relations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2018">Klein and Juhola, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Local authorities are an important enabling actor that can guide the private sector and communities to take responsibility for creating policy and regulatory environments that encourage private sector participation aligned with the SDGs’ equity and ecological sustainability principles (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). For example, Frantzeskaki et al. (2014) report a port relocation project in the Netherlands where sustainability principles drove private sector participation. Klein et al. (2017) cite examples from two cities—Helsinki and Copenhagen, where local authorities have shifted adaptation responsibilities to private actors through regulation and public problem ownership. In Mombasa, private companies provide green infrastructure to match local government requirements, in what has frequently been cited as an example of NBS (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kithiia--2010">Kithiia and Dowling, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kitha--2011">Kitha and Lyth, 2011</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.1.5"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.1.5 Trans-national Municipal Networks <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-42-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since the late 1990s, transnational municipal networks (TMNs) have increased awareness of climate change and served as a bridge for cities to access critical financial resources from private and philanthropic sources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rashidi--2018">Rashidi and Patt, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#F%C3%BCnfgeld--2015">Fünfgeld, 2015</a>). Recently, TMNs have taken on more programmatic functions, working with cities to strategise, plan and incrementally improve their organisation functions in the face of climate change. For example, the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities program (2014–2019) provided a two-year salary for a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to be situated in a municipal authority to bridge silos, incentivise change and develop development strategies for resilience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Spaans--2017">Spaans and Waterhout, 2017</a>). In these cases, external actors have enabled broad organisation change, resource mobilisation pathways and alternative forms of agenda-setting in cities (Chu, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hakelberg--2014">Hakelberg, 2014</a>) (see also Case Study 6.2, Semarang).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A range of TMNs also support and encourage cities and settlements to plan and implement adaptation actions. ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability has developed protocols and implemented projects for member cities. The C40 Climate Leadership Group has facilitated the coordination of both local governments and business actors at a global scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gordon--2020">Gordon, 2020</a>). Policy coordination has been central to the signatories of the Covenant of Mayors (Domorenok <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Such networks can encourage the sharing of information about appropriate practices between urban areas; contribute to goal setting; support experimentation and development of new policy instruments; enhance stakeholder engagement; institutionalise climate agendas; and encourage policy integration across governance levels and sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>; Busch, Bendlin and Fenton, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#F%C3%BCnfgeld--2015">Fünfgeld, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Busch--2015">Busch, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Papin--2019">Papin, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rashidi--2018">Rashidi and Patt, 2018</a>). However, participation in TMNs is biased toward cities in the Global North (Bansard, Pattberg and Widerberg, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Haupt--2019">Haupt and Coppola, 2019</a>). A recent comparative study of 337 cities found out that cities that participation in TNMs are more likely to take adaptation action and that being part of multiple networks leads to higher levels of adaptation planning (Heikkinen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-6.5"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 6.5 | Building Water Resilience in Urban Areas through Community Action and Activism</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-36-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In Bengaluru, India, communities have traditionally managed a network of water tanks of immense ecological importance. However, in the last half-century, urban development has increasingly threatened this blue network (<a class="reference-link" href="#Unnikrishnan--2015">Unnikrishnan and Nagendra, 2015</a>). Today’s Bengaluru depends on long-distance water transfers that create political conflict and a dense network of private boreholes that are depleting the city’s water resources. The restoration of the existing community managed water tanks network offers a more sustainable and socially just alternative for managing water resources.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Unnikrishnan et al. (2018) have documented how the colonial and postcolonial history of water management in Bengaluru shapes the water infrastructure and provision systems today. Water access inequalities can be traced to the patterns of spatial development developed by colonial policies. Records from the sixth century onwards show how city rulers invested in an interconnected, community managed network of tanks and open wells, regularly recharged through harvested rainwater. The water system was changed at the end of the 18th century, as first the colonial state, then the post-independence government of Karnataka took responsibility for water management. Ideas of modernist planning influenced the development of new water infrastructure and piped networks, including the first piped infrastructure, bringing water from sources 30 km away, including the Hesaraghatta and then the TG Halli reservoirs. The old network of tanks gradually deteriorated as tanks became disused, polluted or built over. More prolonged and costly water transfers took place in the post-colonial period, delivering water from the Cauvery River in a massive engineering project with a high energetic cost and enmeshed in inter-state conflicts over water use (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2019">Castán Broto and Sudhira, 2019</a>). Scarcity is still a problem in Bengaluru. The citizen response has been an activist movement to reclaim the city’s tanks, accompanied by a plea to reconsider current water uses within the city, including actions to protect and rejuvenate water wells (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nagendra--2016">Nagendra, 2016</a>). Unnikrishnan et al. (2018) document different actions led by citizen-led collectives, including projects for lake rejuvenation, filtering technologies to treat sewage, recovering the value of lakes through a share of photos and art projects, and involvement of local knowledge in-tank restoration. Those efforts suggest an untapped potential to deliver adaptive green spaces through the recovery of Bengaluru’s tanks.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.4.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.4.2 Institutional Change to Deliver Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-20-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The main barriers to urban climate adaptation, and strategies to address them, relate to institutional change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (see Table 6.7).

Institutional change at the local level can be achieved with diverse strategies (Patterson, de Voogt and Sapiains, 2019). Table 6.7 illustrates various instruments that enable the institutionalisation of climate adaptation concerns into policy and planning. As Table 6.7 shows, institutional change is often used as synonymous with mainstreaming. Both terms refer to the integration of climate adaptation concerns into other areas of work and as part of practical routines and arguments (Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Storbj%C3%B6rk--2015">Storbjörk and Uggla, 2015</a>; Runhaar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Uittenbroek <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Early assessments understood mainstreaming as activities that integrate climate adaptation into long-range and sectoral plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Anguelovski--2011">Anguelovski and Carmin, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). Since then, efforts to mainstream climate adaptation have grown into agendas around the community and economic development (Ayers <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014), climate mitigation (Göpfert, Wamsler and Lang, 2019), spatial and infrastructure planning (Anguelovski, Chu and Carmin, 2014), urban finance (Musah-Surugu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019), public health (Araos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015), environmental management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wamsler--2015">Wamsler, 2015</a>; Kabisch <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016) and multi-level decision making (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ojea--2015">Ojea, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Visseren-Hamakers--2015">Visseren-Hamakers, 2015</a>). Such efforts require various degrees of regulatory or programmatic action to integrate adaptation with other concerns (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wamsler--2016">Wamsler and Pauleit, 2016</a>). However, institutional change has a broader remit than mainstreaming adaptation, as it may include, for example, changing the organisations already dealing with climate adaptation and make them more effective including changes in inputs, procedures and options (Patterson, de Voogt and Sapiains, 2019).</p><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.2.1 Input-Driven Institutional Change <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-43-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Input-driven institutional change creates incentives to deliver adaptation action. An input view focuses on the intrinsic capacities of a given organisation. Input indicators are often referred to as political capital (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rosenzweig--2018">Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Diederichs--2016">Diederichs and Roberts, 2016</a>), existing or endogenous resources (Moloney and <a class="reference-link" href="#F%C3%BCnfgeld--2015">Fünfgeld, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wamsler--2014">Wamsler and Brink, 2014</a>), or local drivers for adaptation (Dilling <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). ReResearch conducted across two municipalities in Western Cape, South Africa, showed the importance of a dedicated environmental champion, access to a knowledge base, the availability of resources, political stability and the presence of dense social networks (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Research from São Paulo, Brazil, showed how intrinsic political capacities and contextual factors, such as the political ideology of elected officials, shaped opportunities for embedding adaptation into ongoing urban agendas (Di Giulio <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Networks, interactions and actor coalitions shape options for institutional change. <a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett (2015)</a> noted the importance of internal networks between municipal departments, including informal communication channels, cultivating personal contacts and trust between the person or team responsible for climate planning and staff within other local government agencies. Internal networks can facilitate the commitment of local elected officials (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hughes--2015">Hughes, 2015</a>), support higher municipal expenditures per capita and foster perceptions that climate adaptation is needed (Shi, Chu and Debats, 2015). Collective decision-making can integrate multiple types of information with moral concerns and provide key rationales that enable adaptation action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carlson--2015">Carlson and McCormick, 2015</a>). In urban areas in Africa, research on internal networks has also investigated how informal arrangements shape action possibilities (Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). For example, in Zimbabwe, informal, traditional and civil society institutions are core arenas for issue discussion because of lower public sector capacities (Mubaya and Mafongoya, 2017). In Durban, South Africa, local governments rely considerably on shadow systems and informal spaces of information and knowledge exchange across their operations to introduce and sustain new ideas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leck--2015">Leck and Roberts, 2015</a>). In the metropolitan area of Styria, Austria, informal cooperation has supported the development of rural–urban partnerships for the formulation of common goals (Oedl-Wieser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). In Arkansas, USA, informal governance structures support planning to manage wildfires (Miller, Vos and Lindquist, 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Cities can leverage input-driven institutional change even without national support for climate change adaptation or mitigation. For example, where cities have defined policymaking and budget raising powers, city level political leadership can support adaptation action going beyond national policy (Hamin, Gurran and Emlinger, 2014; Shi, Chu and Debats, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carlson--2015">Carlson and McCormick, 2015</a>). Examples include the Surat Climate Change Trust in Surat, India (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2016">Chu, 2016</a>) and Initiative for Urban Climate Change and Environment in Semarang, Indonesia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taylor--2015">Taylor and Lassa, 2015</a>). In Saint Louis, Senegal, support from national and state-level actors enabled local institutional change (Vedeld <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Processual levers may be also mobilised in situations of political instability (which disrupts patterns in champions and networks), clientelism (which can cause environmental projects to be discontinued) (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015) or in contexts where there are high political and socioeconomic inequalities (Harris, Chu and Ziervogel, 2018; Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.2.2 Output-Driven Institutional Change <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-44-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Output-driven institutional change is shaped by organisational products such as strategies, plans, policies and evaluative metrics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patterson--2019">Patterson and Huitema, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>) (See Table 6.8). There are numerous examples of institutional change through planning outcomes. For example, Manizales, Colombia has included climate adaptation into long-established environmental policy (Biomanizales) and a local environmental action plan (Bioplan), which follows on from a long coherent trajectory of climate change policy (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2014). A significant number of North American cities have integrated adaptation into long-range plans, while fewer cities integrate adaptation in sustainable development plans or sectoral plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). Canadian cities are more likely to have a plan specifically focused on adaptation rather than having adaptation integrated into municipal long-range planning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). In the European Union, adaptation plans depended on national climate legislation or, in fewer cases, the influence of an international climate network (Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b). A comparative report from the Covenant of Mayors, however, suggests that the adaptation pillar needs development to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptation responses and their integration with mitigation goals (Bertoldi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Municipalities in Sweden have been called ‘pre-reactive’ because adequate strategic guidelines are in place to frame the accessibility, aesthetics and adaptability of waterfront developments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Storbj%C3%B6rk--2015">Storbjörk and Uggla, 2015</a>). Some Asian cities also report high output effectiveness, where they are more likely to indicate senior local government officials’ performance management contracts, the budgeting procedures of local government agencies and the procedures that local government agencies use for budgeting infrastructure spending (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). Despite this evidence, there is a gap in understanding the general trends of planning and institutional change in Africa, Asia, East Europe and the Middle East.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Institutional change processes are complex, contested and sporadic (Patterson, de Voogt and Sapiains, 2019). Such processes are often inhibited by unclear planning mandates, conflicting development priorities, lack of leadership and resource and capacity shortfalls (Anguelovski et al. 2014). There is no one size fits all approach to institutional change, which works <span class="condensed_italic" lang>in situ</span>, and benefits from clearly defined plans and an incremental approach to revising new elements and addressing gaps or failures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Beunen--2017">Beunen et al., 2017</a>).

For example, in some administrative jurisdictions (most of them local governments), calls by social movements for the adoption of Climate Emergency Declarations were addressed, however, practical outcomes in terms of adaptation have been limited, and may have foreclosed other future local actions (Nissen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Ruiz Campillo, Castán Broto and Westman, 2020) and raised concerns about maladaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Long--2019">Long and Rice, 2019</a>).

Adaptation action solely focused on action tends to ignore areas in the city for which there is no existing data even though actions in these areas may play an essential role in shaping resilience and its limits. Informal settlements and informal economies, which are integral in managing urban resources for effective climate adaptation, are not routinely included in formal urban and national monitoring(<a class="reference-link" href="#Guibrunet--2016">Guibrunet and Castán Broto, 2016</a>). The resulting understanding and monitoring of city needs, capacities and actions that feed into policy is incomplete. The innovation, as well as particular concerns and capacities of the informal sector, which is often highly gendered, are not always measured (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2016">Brown and McGranahan, 2016</a>). An emphasis on measurable adaptation outcomes may lead to prioritising techno-economic measures to adaptation at the local level. Technocratic approaches to environmental policy continue to shape local sustainability politics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bulkeley--2015">Bulkeley, 2015</a>). The deployment of such technocratic approaches at the local scale is detrimental for democratic and collaborative practices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Metzger--2020">Metzger and Lindblad, 2020</a>). For example, while China has received praise in terms of delivering urban policies that put climate change at its core, thus suggesting its role providing leadership in climate change debates (Liu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2015">Wang and He, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fu--2017">Fu and Zhang, 2017</a>), other analyses suggest that processes of planning should take greater account of certain groups and interests (<a class="reference-link" href="#Westman--2018">Westman and Broto, 2018</a>).

The integration of climate adaptation in local policies in cities and settlements has often been seen as maintaining business-as-usual and not always aligned with transformative efforts to address structural drivers of vulnerability (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). For example, mainstream actions that seek to advance other development objectives, as explained above, may reduce adaptation to ‘low-hanging fruits’, which may maintain business-as-usual practices without any fundamental transformation of the social, institutional and economic systems that drive vulnerabilities (Aylett, 2014). However, as explained above, mainstreaming can also generate wider processes of institutional change (<a class="section-link" data-title="Institutional Change to Deliver Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.2">Section 6.4.2</a>). Mainstream strategies may help to demonstrate how policy and frameworks can produce practical outcomes on the ground (<a class="reference-link" href="#Biesbroek--2020">Biesbroek and Delaney, 2020</a>). However, previous experiences in other sectors, such as gender mainstreaming, have shown the limitations of the mainstreaming approach, particularly in terms of addressing the structural drivers of inequality and vulnerability, and in achieving justice for those who suffer most (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moser--2017">Moser, 2017</a>). Local governments in particular, can link mainstreaming efforts with specific strategies that support justice in adaptation, including redistribution efforts to address vulnerabilities (see <a class="section-link" data-title="The Adaptation Gap in Cities and Settlements" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.2">Section 6.3.2</a>), representation in local institution and deliberative processes, and recognition of the conditions for self-realisation, including personal and collective safety (Agyeman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2017">Castán Broto and Westman, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2019">Castán Broto and Westman, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hess--2021">Hess and McKane, 2021</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.3.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.3.3 Facilitates Coordination Across Separate Actors and Interests <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-47-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Coordination of adaptation policy goals cuts across cities to integrate them into international processes of climate policy formulation; coordination in cities produces effective collective outcomes, cementation of common standards and methodologies for climate action (e.g., emission inventories) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gordon--2017">Gordon and Johnson, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hsu--2021">Hsu and Rauber, 2021</a>).

These processes can also support citizens to manage risks as they encounter them in their everyday life (Ziervogel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">To respond to urban injustices, attention needs to be paid to both the local level and to broader system-wide governance issues (that are unpacked further in <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). At the local level, it is important to understand who is most vulnerable to climate risk, which is likely to be related to class, race, gender, ability and age (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilby--2012">Wilby and Keenan, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ranganathan--2019">Ranganathan and Bratman, 2019</a>; Thomas, Cretney and Hayward, 2019). Factors such as age and levels of ability, as well as those pursuing outdoor livelihoods, have a direct link to higher vulnerability to heat stress (Conry <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). In least-developed countries, less than 60% of the urban population have access to piped water which impacts on health and well-being, and emphasises the importance of alternative resources for these households (World Health Organization, Nations and Fund, 2017).</p><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.3.6"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.3.6 Supports Visionary and Imaginative Design <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-50-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The failure to deliver inclusive and sustainable adaptation contributes to a collective inability to mobilise the power of creative community vision (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Urban design plays a central role to support creative adaptation strategies (Box 6.7). Much adaptation action repeats previous experiences. However, the potential for building resilience to deliver adaptation, especially transformative adaptation, requires an articulation of collective visions of the future and the imagination of new or alternative urban futures (Glaas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), including through design and deliberate engagement with cultural artefacts, technologies and performances (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jordan--2020">Jordan, 2020</a>). Social movements can be powerful sources of such alternative visions of the future, as exemplified by recent Youth Climate Strikes and Extinction Rebellion (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>). Community protest such as Youth Climate Strikes have influenced urban climate policy agendas including the declaration of climate emergency in municipalities worldwide, fostering a new debate on climate change, although their impact on local policy is ambiguous (Davidson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Thomas, Cretney and Hayward, 2019; Prendergast <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Ruiz Campillo, Castán Broto and Westman, 2020). Social movements on climate mitigation, such as the Transition Movement and Transition Towns (<a class="reference-link" href="#Feola--2014">Feola and Nunes, 2014</a>), and school strikes may serve as an example for mobilisations more specifically about climate adaptation and the way new, networked, grassroots citizen activism and community organisations can encourage urban institutional change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gunningham--2019">Gunningham, 2019</a>; Jordan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Wahlström <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

For example, some of these creative design approaches compliment and extend regulatory and land use planning approaches such as form-based codes and established certifications such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design–Neighbourhood Design (LEED-ND) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garde--2018">Garde, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Garde--2017">Garde and Hoff, 2017</a>) and the USA’s Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Valente--2014">Valente, 2014</a>). Emphasis on sufficiency has also influenced urban design, for example, with the mobilisation of ‘doughnut’ economics that emphasise both a social foundation and an environmental ceiling, for example Amsterdam (<a class="reference-link" href="#Raworth--2017">Raworth, 2017</a>). However, such cases are rare, substantial public investment is often required (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Transformations" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.7">Section 6.4.7</a> on finance and insurance). Other approaches underscore innovation and creativity, at the essence of which are context-specific interventions that draw on a compendium of urban design principles such as indeterminacy (to accommodate climate uncertainty), polyvalency and diversity, and harmony with nature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2017">Dhar and Khirfan, 2017</a>). Creative interventions include the daylighting of buried streams to create climate adaptive public realms (Khirfan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Khirfan, Mohtat and Peck, 2020). For example, the demolition of a major expressway and the restoration of the Cheonggyecheon Stream reorganised downtown Seoul, South Korea, and significantly contributed to climate change adaptation through stormwater management and reducing the urban heat island effect (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kim--2019">Kim and Jung, 2019</a>). Biomimicry and ecological infrastructure are design features that governance bodies can use to reshape space and contribute to place making (<a class="reference-link" href="#Santos%20Nouri--2017">Santos Nouri and Costa, 2017</a>; Prior <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). For example, urban metabolism and local ecological knowledge has constituted the essence of urban design interventions on the Island of Tobago in ways that capitalise on the contiguous relationship between ecosystems (e.g., the mangrove forest) and human actions (rainwater harvesting and grey water management) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Khirfan--2016">Khirfan and Zhang, 2016</a>). While lack of funding or design capacity, restrictive planning regulations, inequality and competing urban agendas can create barriers for the implementation of creative design solutions.

However efforts to track urban adaptation lack consistent methods, metrics and data gathering (Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019b). The scale of complex, cascading challenges, limited finance and governance capacity, combined with the impacts of growing social inequality and sustainable development priorities can result in both soft and hard limits on cities government’s capacity to adapt to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chanza--2018">Chanza, 2018</a>; Sanchez Rodriguez, Ürge-Vorsatz and Barau, 2018; Lehmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Di Giulio <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Hard limits to adaptation are identified when it is unfeasible to avoid severe risks, while soft limits exist when technological and socioeconomic options are not immediately deployable (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014">IPCC, 2014</a>). In urban contexts, soft limits may become hard limits when large numbers of people are unable to avoid severe climate-related risks of loss and damage (Mechler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Climate change-related loss and damage that are intangible also require more caution in assessment processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2018">Roberts and Pelling, 2018</a>; Andrei <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Barnett <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Thomas--2018">Thomas and Benjamin, 2018</a>). Incorporating Indigenous knowledge can identify people-oriented and place-specific scenarios, leading to development of urban adaptation policies that foster identity, dignity, self-determination and better collective decision making/capacity to act (<a class="reference-link" href="#McShane--2017">McShane, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Preston--2017">Preston, 2017</a>), and are also sensitive to the local context and limits of community adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Makondo--2018">Makondo and Thomas, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Urban transformations represent forms of adaptation that challenge the principles in which a society is established (Pelling, O’Brien and Matyas, 2015) and can be deployed to go beyond the existing limits of development justice and climate change adaptation capacity. While not all adaptation will be transformative, transformative capacities support both ongoing adaptation efforts and the broader systemic change processes that align adaptation efforts with decarbonisation requirements and the delivery of SDGs. ‘Urban transformative capacity’ focuses on understanding what elements of a system to respond to external changing conditions in a manner that transforms the system toward a more sustainable state (Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016). The capacities required to deliver adaptation action in cities and settlements are ‘transformative capacities’, because they move away from thinking of adaptation as an adjustment to a changing external environment to think instead of it as a reconfiguration of infrastructures and institutions to build resilience in the surrounding environment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pelling--2010">Pelling, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Matyas--2015">Matyas and Pelling, 2015</a>). Reflective and iterative learning is integral to fostering transformative capacity (c.f. Luederitz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Transformative capacity extends across multiple agency levels or geographical locations, as well as various domains (Wilson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Olsson, Bodin and Folke, 2010; Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019b). The components of transformative capacity in cities and settlements can be grouped into three categories (see Table 6.9): (1) agency and forms of interaction, (2) development processes and (3) relational dimensions (Wolfram, 2016). Alongside different forms of technical expertise, there is a need to broaden the interventions of disadvantaged populations in urban sustainability (Wolfram, Borgström and Farrelly, 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Table 6.9 presents a defined framework of ideas that local institutions, mostly local governments, can put into practice to improve their adaptive capacity. Enabling transformative capacity requires novel governance arrangements based on broad participation, a diversity of actor networks, socially embedded leadership and empowerment of communities, alongside an understanding of the system dynamics, which refers to system awareness, collective visions, practical experimentation, reflexivity, capacity building, institutional mainstreaming and the multiple levels of agency or scales (Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019a">Ziervogel, 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wolfram--2019">Wolfram, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6lscher--2020">Hölscher and Frantzeskaki, 2020</a>; Castán Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Many of the transformative capacity components are already visible in local adaptation actions, but many efforts emphasise one element at the expense of others without delivering a systemic perspective. In particular, measures to facilitate the empowerment of communities, reflexivity and social learning are rare but often point toward heightened capacities for transformative, alongside incremental, adaptation (Castán Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Transformative capacity frameworks may foster inclusive governance to deliver risk management that works for the poor in countries such as South Africa (<a class="reference-link"

Cities and settlements frequently face barriers of inadequate financing for climate adaptation and mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cook--2018">Cook and Chu, 2018</a>).

It will also depend on selected adaptation options, as they have different capital requirements, operating costs and returns on investment (See 6.3). Finally, costs depend on financing sources and mechanisms selected.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Broadly, there are two options for adaptation investment: funding, direct expenditure in preparation for or response to climate change impacts, and financing, the deployment of market-based instruments to attract third-party resources to an adaptation action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keenan--2018">Keenan, 2018</a>; Banhalmi-Zakar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Using funding can be a lower-cost strategy, as there is no third party expecting a return on investment. However, using financing can expand the total resources available for adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#White--2019">White and Wahba, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The choice of funding and financing mechanism is often based on implicit economic world views (Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019) or on the technical support available to sub-national governments, such as preparing municipal bonds or contracting for public–private partnerships (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bisaro--2018">Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018</a>). The urban finance literature has long called for critical interrogation of these choices, as adaptation finance has profound justice implications (Khan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). However, the literature on adaptation investments is limited (Harman, Taylor and Lane, 2015; Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019).

Financing Gap <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-51-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Cities and settlements in higher-income countries typically have access to funding that could be used to enhance resilience and build adaptive capacity; this includes both the private resources of individual households and firms (which varies significantly within and among cities) and public budgets of different government tiers (see Table 6.10).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Depending on fiscal devolution levels within a country, public revenues may be collected and managed primarily at the national, state, metropolitan or local level. In federal countries, sub-national governments collect an average of 49.4% of public revenues, compared with only 20.7% in unitary countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD/UCLG--2019">OECD/UCLG, 2019</a>). For example, sub-national revenues represent over a quarter of total public revenues in Belgium, Canada and Denmark, but less than 5% in Greece, Ireland and New Zealand (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD/UCLG--2019">OECD/UCLG, 2019</a>). The share of the national revenue transferred to sub-national governments also varies significantly among countries: grants and subsidies account for over three-quarters of sub-national government revenue in Malta, but less than a quarter of sub-national revenue in Iceland (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD/UCLG--2019">OECD/UCLG, 2019</a>). A local government’s capacity to collect revenues is further mediated by incomes within a city (which dictates the prospective tax base) and the capacity of civil servants to administer taxes, fees and charges. The result is that metropolitan and local governments’ budgets vary dramatically, across and within countries. For example, per capita municipal budgets vary from USD 1114 in Saskatoon and USD 2682 in Peterborough (Canada), USD 2635 in Leipzig and USD 3638 in Freiburg (Germany), to USD 4907 in Bristol and USD 5612 in Aberdeen (UK) (<a class="reference-link" href="#L%C3%B6ffler--2016">Löffler, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Revenue streams are often insufficient relative to the scale of adaptation requirements. For example, Kano, Nigeria, is a large urban area that urgently needs investment in human development and climate resilience but where a fragmented local government has little capacity to finance their climate plans (Mohammed, Hassan and Badamasi, 2019). Many local governments are unable to mobilise funds for adaptation as they face competing priorities, meaning that resources for resilience must be allocated by higher levels of government (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hughes--2015">Hughes, 2015</a>), which also perceive opportunity costs to adaptation investments. Funding from non-state actors is, therefore, proving important. For example, in the USA, private foundations and non-profit organisations account for 17% and 16%, respectively, of adaptation support in urban areas (Carmin, Nadkarni and Rhie, 2012). However, tapping into these funding sources raises complex questions about accountability and ownership of urban adaptation (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Land reclamation may foster real estate markets and mobilise finance for adaptation, as shown in Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives (Bisaro <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">City governments need to anticipate climate shocks and stresses, and design their operating models and investment plans accordingly to ensure financial resilience (Clarvis et al, 2015). Climate risks threaten fiscal models, for example, a drought may disrupt water revenues by reducing total water consumption and incentivising households and firms to invest in independent water storage or supply infrastructure (Simpson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Storm surges and sea level rise may threaten sunk investments in revenue-generating infrastructures such as toll roads or electricity generation and transmission systems. .</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="6.4.5.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">6.4.5.2 Barriers to Adaptation Investments <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-52-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Common sources of adaptation finance might include donor agencies including the Green Climate Fund, sovereign funds (e.g., the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund) and private finance from commercial banks, investment companies, pension funds and insurance companies (Floater <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). These capital sources have different risk–return expectations and investment horizons, so they will suit different types and stages of projects. Many sub-national governments in the Global North have access to well-developed domestic, if not global, capital markets to raise and steer finance for urban investment (Banhalmi-Zakar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">However, investments in <span class="condensed_italic" lang>ex ante</span> urban climate adaptation may prove less attractive to these financiers than other opportunities because of their long maturities and high risk (Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019) (see also Table 6.11). Many generate economic returns primarily through avoided losses from climate impacts, which are difficult to measure and are, in any case, more attractive to funders than financiers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kaufman--2014">Kaufman, 2014</a>). <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Ex post </span>, insurance already plays a critical role in protecting urban households, firms and other stakeholders from the full economic costs of high-severity, low-frequency events by sharing risk over time and space. Insurance can also be designed to incentivise risk-reducing behaviours and investments (Banhalmi-Zakar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Paddam--2017">Paddam and Wong, 2017</a>). Some researchers suggest that, in urban environments, insurance practices are helping to establish adaptation and risk as a new area of public health and public protection. For example, local governments are using new risk transfer instruments, such as re-insurance and catastrophe bonds, to fund investments in resilience projects and disaster recovery (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collier--2021">Collier and Cox, 2021</a>). However, the commercial feasibility of private sector insurance depends on more robust estimates of current and future risks, and premiums commensurate with the ability and willingness of consumers to pay. Therefore, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>ex ante</span> investments must complement insurance schemes to improve climate modelling and reduce climate risk (Surminski, Bouwer and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2016).

Local governments may strengthen their own source revenue collection and management capacities to better exploit these funding streams and improve their balance sheets, but their total budget will be limited to these funding sources (Ahmad <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). The amount of local public funding available for urban adaptation depends on the relationships across different government levels.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Similarly, mobilising private finance for urban adaptation projects demands robust institutional, fiscal and regulatory frameworks, which are typically national authorities’ responsibility. For local governments to access private finance for adaptation may require national (or in federal countries, state) governments to reform policies and rules governing municipal borrowing, public–private partnerships, land value capture instruments and other financing mechanisms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ware--2017">Ware and Banhalmi-Zakar, 2017</a>). Such fiscal reforms tap into fundamental political and policy issues, such as local governments’ autonomy or the tariff-setting powers of national ministries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gorelick--2018">Gorelick, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#White--2019">White and Wahba, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Access to private finance can support infrastructure development through private provisioning, public–private partnerships (PPP) and public debt arrangements (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="The Role of Non-State Actors in Local Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.1.2">Section 6.4.1.2</a>). Private provisioning attracts coastal adaptation investment when returns are high (e.g., when there is a real estate market associated with it) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bisaro--2018">Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018</a>). Public–private partnerships attract investments from dredging and construction companies that involve a large share of operational costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bisaro--2018">Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018</a>). Public debt instruments appear less successful in supporting investment in adaptation infrastructure. Real estate firms focus on adaptation actions if they perceive climate change impacts such as flooding may impact their activity, mostly focusing on adaptation action as a means to gain competitive advantage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Teicher--2018">Teicher, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There have been numerous attempts to innovate in climate finance, for example, mobilising community and cooperative forms of finance, or crowdfunding, which have already proven effective in the context of mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#De%20Broeck--2018">De Broeck, 2018</a>). A well-studied instrument in urban environments is land-value capture. Land-value capture refers to communities’ ability to capture the benefit of increased land values that result from public investment or other government actions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Germ%C3%A1n--2020">Germán and Bernstein, 2020</a>). There is considerable potential to mobilise land-value capture for adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>), but its potential remains unexplored (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dunning--2020">Dunning and Lord, 2020</a>). While there are numerous examples of the mobilisation of land-value capture to finance sustainable development action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2019">Li and Love, 2019</a>; Wang, Samsura and van der Krabben, 2019), there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> of its use in climate adaptation (see Case Study 6.2). These innovations are particularly important in contexts where resources are very constrained, such as in the financing of adaptation in African cities (See Box 6.7).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Corruption in urban adaptation and disaster risk management finance is a considerable but little researched challenge observed from all world regions (Sanderson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Corruption generates maladaptation, increasing risk, for example where infrastructure is constructed with faulty design, substandard materials and inadequate maintenance (Kabir <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). More widely, corruption increases vulnerability and reduces capacity by damaging the body politic, distorting markets and reducing economic growth (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alexander--2017">Alexander, 2017</a>). The construction and infrastructure industries are repeatedly identified as sources of corruption (<a class="reference-link" href="#GIACC--2020">GIACC, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2017">Chan and Owusu, 2017</a>; Sanderson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Corruption and misuse of climate finance is exacerbated by limited public access to information, political considerations in finance decision making and lack of accountability for decisions and actions (Kabir <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). In construction, Owusu et al. (2019) found causes included too-close relationships, poor professional ethical standards, negative industrial and working conditions, negative role models and inadequate sanctions throughout the phases of construction. Post-disaster response and reconstruction, and periods of surge funding following international or national policy priorities are especially vulnerable to corruption, with increased funding and pressure to lower norms of financial management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Imperiale--2021">Imperiale and Vanclay, 2021</a>). Mixed delivery mechanisms have been shown to reduce corruption, for example where civil society organisations are involved in project approval stages, although there is also a risk that civil society organisations will themselves become entangled in corruption. International donors have a role to play in working with government and civil society to promote wider scrutiny and transparency of financing processes and project delivery through promoting media and press freedom and legislation for access to information to reduce corruption by enhancing transparency and accountability (Kabir <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Expanding the resource envelope available for adaptation investment is often beyond the authority or competency of city governments. Sovereign and state governments have critical roles to play in providing funding or securing finance for adaptation investments. Such a role is particularly important where the impacts of climate change are distributed inequitably across a country, so that the costs borne by a city may exceed local budgets.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-6.8"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 6.8 | Challenges to Investment in Adaptation in African Cities</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-38-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In Africa, new investment in institutions can support other enabling conditions for climate-resilient urban development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Robins--2018">Robins, 2018</a>).

Africa faces an estimated 40% infrastructure financing gap, but this gap is almost certainly higher in the continent’s rapidly growing cities (Baker and McKenzie, 2015). Relative poverty, weak or absent local fiscal systems, and contested tenure that prevents land being used as collateral, have restricted investment in African cities (Berrisford, Cirolia and Palmer, 2018; Dodman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Sub-Saharan African countries are reaching the 40% urban threshold at national per capita incomes of around USD 1000 per annum, significantly poorer than South-East Asian and Latin American cities at the same level of urbanisation (Freire, Lall and Leipziger, 2014).

In the absence of enforceable spatial plans and strong urban governance, the risk remains that individual investment projects that are completed will aggregate to create urban systems that are at risk from climate change through the locking-in of inequality, urban sprawl, flooding and greenhouse gas emissions (Dodman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Wachsmuth, Cohen and Angelo, 2016).

Despite significant experience on the application in other sectors (e.g., health, water, industry or business) or with other climate change objectives (e.g., emissions reduction), the assessment of adaptation efforts has been to date under-theorised in current urban adaptation literature (Berrang-Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Leiter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019b).

Monitoring and evaluation systems in urban areas will necessarily be incremental and additive, and will have to build on existing indicator systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Solecki--2020">Solecki and Rosenzweig, 2020</a>). There is a need to develop practical and efficient frameworks to assess adaptation progress across all levels of public and private decision making. This should include the assessment and consideration of top-down adaptations alongside informal, bottom-up community actions, or corporate-led programmes developed to reduce vulnerabilities and climatic risks and increase resilience (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">On the one hand, there is a need to guarantee that planned adaptation actions are efficient, just and equitable (Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019b), including being able to disaggregate, for example by gendered impacts. On the other hand, there is a need to observe if and how environmental, social and economic vulnerability and climatic risk conditions evolve with time. Surveillance, monitoring and evaluation facilitate adaptation decision making by linking three aspects (Berrang-Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019): (1) changing vulnerabilities and risks, (2) established adaptation goals and targets, and (3) adaptation efforts put in place. The process will help evaluate whether current adaptation efforts are sufficient or adequate, thus enabling the learning process that adaptation action requires (Haasnoot, van’t Klooster and Van Alphen, 2018; Klostermann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Monitoring and evaluation of government-led urban adaptation in major cities around the globe is largely missing (Araos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a). This reveals: (1) a lack of awareness by local adaptation managers about the critical importance of monitoring and evaluation systems in adaptation decision making, (2) inadequacy, irrelevancy or underuse of available monitoring and evaluation resources, or (3) a lack of knowledge, capacity and resources to make monitoring and evaluation work in practice at city scale.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><a class="reference-link" href="#Olazabal--2019b">Olazabal et al.

(2018)</a> emphasise the importance of learning through iterative cycles of selection of monitoring objectives, procedures, data collection and evaluation, and inputs to adaptation policy and planning processes (see also discussion of evaluation and learning in <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.1">Section 17.5.1.7</a>). Yet practical exemplary approaches are still missing.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report acknowledged the lack of standard metrics to measure and monitor success in urban adaptation and suggested a list of indicators that could be developed, while also taking note of the localised nature of adaptation (see also (Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015)). However, predominant approaches are typically not conducted at the appropriate scale to inform adaptation decision-making (Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). While some scholars advocate the use of a unifying indicator of social vulnerability (Spielman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020), others propose to develop flexible sets of comparable indicators that can be adjusted to different contexts (Leiter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Risk-based approaches are seen as an alternative in a context where the monitoring of decision-relevant variables in urban climate adaptation planning is essential to link climatic risk assessment and action (Hallegatte and Engle, 2019; Kingsborough, Borgomeo and Hall, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#McDermott--2018">McDermott and Surminski, 2018</a>). Because of the need to define normative frameworks for risk evaluation, what is acceptable, for what purpose and for how long (Galarraga <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), these approaches may offer an opportunity for the generation of a shared understanding on goals and limitations of adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#McDermott--2018">McDermott and Surminski, 2018</a>). However, risk-based indicators may also create a bias toward quantifiable variables that tend to be based on climatic modelling outputs, engineering or financial assessments. Based on this and various examples of urban development projects, Hallegatte and Engle (2019) claim it is important to consider output-based indicators and process-based indicators that talk about government, voice and empowerment. Overall, dozens of indicator-based approaches to assess climate adaptation have been proposed across the scientific and policy literature, especially in the broader framework of (community) resilience assessment tools (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sharifi--2016">Sharifi, 2016</a>; Feldmeyer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), and in different sectors, for example the climate benefits of NBS (Kabisch <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Donatti <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Although these efforts may help to mainstream the evaluation of adaptation in current city evaluation initiatives, the development of comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems is lacking.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is little evidence on how best to make monitoring and evaluation approaches practical at the local scale. Cities worldwide face important social, environmental and economic conflicts related to resource inequality, poverty, environmental pollution and social tensions that coexist with climatic risks. It makes sense to integrate climate change adaptation assessment goals and needs into existing frameworks for the sake of efficiency. This will benefit small urban areas and cities in developing regions that often face data scarcity and may also find available indicators irrelevant to their realities and, thus, be required to adjust them (Simon <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Efforts to coordinate frameworks for the assessment of sustainability (e.g., Local Agenda, sustainability appraisals), resilience (e.g., 100 Resilient Cities, new standards for urban resilience), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting (e.g., Global Covenant of Mayors for Energy and Climate) can be deployed to learn about contexts. However, they need to be applied with caution as enforcing external requirements may lead to local tensions during their application (for example Roberts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). In a context where adaptation efforts need to be aggregated and evaluated across nations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Magnan--2016">Magnan, 2016</a>) and their implications on wider objectives such as sustainable development and social justice need to be assessed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Long--2019">Long and Rice, 2019</a>), urban adaptation monitoring and evaluation can inform national and international processes that enable a global stocktake of adaptation.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="6.4.7"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">6.4.7 Enabling Transformations <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-26-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Growing awareness of the interlocking of drivers of urban change and vulnerability has motivated an interest in transformational approaches to adaptation action in cities, settlements and infrastructure. While the idea of transformation has been adopted across the field, there is no consensus about what an urban transformation that addresses adaptation means. There is no one single transformative solution or approach relevant in every case (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shi--2019">Shi, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Goh--2019">Goh, 2019</a>). What constitutes ‘urgent’ and ‘far-reaching’ transformation depends on the local community’s expectations and ideas (Choko <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Transformation is often approached as a process of institutional transformation, akin to the process described in <a class="section-link" data-title="Institutional Change to Deliver Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.2">Section 6.4.2</a> (see, for example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Duijn--2017">Duijn and van Buuren, 2017</a>). Transformation engages with critiques of adaptation or risk reduction as an individual responsibility (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sou--2018">Sou, 2018</a>). The idea is to use transformation to focus on coordinating collective efforts (Haque et al, 2014). The coordination of multiple actors is a condition to enable transformative institutions (Torabi et al, 2018) and link adaptation action to development efforts (Chu et al, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2013">Roberts and O’Donoghue, 2013</a>). The role of communities and citizens in such an approach to transformation is ambiguous. Sometimes communities and citizens are presented as critical agents of transformation (Limthongsakul et al, 2017). Other times, however, they are simply situated within strong and durable networks that provide the institutional setting to build resilience (Danière <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Despite the political nature of transformative approaches and the evidence that transformative approaches rely on protest and political activism, few authors recognise this strategy (but see <a class="reference-link" href="#Bahadur--2014">Bahadur and Tanner, 2014</a>; Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dierwechter--2013">Dierwechter and Wessells, 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Transformation is also more than a single instance of institutional change. Historical perspectives on transformation enable an understanding of the chain of institutional changes that ultimately lead to significant or far-reaching reconfiguration of infrastructure and service provision (Rojas et al, 2015). Paradigm changes, such as new engagements with nature and green infrastructure, will improve adaptation outcomes (Roberts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2012). Changes of paradigms, however, are not inherently positive and may clash with existing interests or involve trade-offs with other priorities. When care is taken to ensure greater inclusion in urban decision-making, disadvantaged, vulnerable communities are less likely to be disadvantaged. For example, indigenous traditions of nature management provide entry points for the sustainable management of resources, such as seed banks, urban agriculture and the local management of watersheds and floods, may be at odds with conventional structures of expert knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cid-Aguayo--2016">Cid-Aguayo, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chandra--2016">Chandra and Gaganis, 2016</a>). These traditions are vital both because of the solution space that they open in the local context and how they serve to create resilience through collective and intergenerational learning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chandra--2016">Chandra and Gaganis, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">While aspects of transformative capacity identified in the literature may facilitate far-reaching change, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> of actual transformations as an outcome of adaptation. While community led resilience agendas may tackle poverty related issues, they struggle to tackle city-wide structural forms of inequality (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Processes of shared learning and co-production of knowledge can reinforce existing power dynamics and be limited by technical framings of vulnerability that marginalise political issues (Orleans Reed <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). These issues are especially acute in relation to land use decisions where short-term fiscal and commercial interests conflict with long-term vulnerability reduction objectives (Brown, Dayal and Rumbaitis Del Rio, 2012). It can be difficult for adaptation actions to target cities’ underlying political–economic structure, such as entrenched political–economic interests, elite influence over decision making or neoliberal planning logics that maintain and reproduce inequality (Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017). Urban resilience plans may be formulated in disconnection from broader development strategies, which leads to a limited ability to tackle underlying structures of political power and urban development practices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weinstein--2019">Weinstein et al., 2019</a>). Evidence from Kolkata demonstrates the limitations of resilience plans to address underlying conditions of vulnerability, including the commodification of hazardous land, under-provision of informal settlements and spatial segregation of the urban poor (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rumbach--2017">Rumbach, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Planning for transformative adaptation is more <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> where communities can learn collectively (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>) (Restemeyer, van den Brink and Woltjer, 2017; Kabisch <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Fraser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Putri, Dalimunthe and Prasojo). Greater citizen engagement facilitates implementing specific measures for radical policymaking or the mainstreaming of environmental knowledge into adaptation practices (Reed et al, 2015). Do it yourself (DIY) planning, in which stakeholders focus on creating and improving specific urban spaces they inhabit, has led to urban greening experiments led by civil society that change paradigms of urban and environmental management (Cloutier, Papin and Bizier, 2018). Social learning may occur through combinations of activism and collaboration with and between informal settlement dwellers, as shown in adaptation experiences in informal settlements in Hanoi and Bangkok (Danière <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).. The adaptation process can benefit from the inclusion of multiple sources of knowledge for social learning, including universities but also communities and citizens (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Citizens assemblies are increasingly recognised as spaces for transformative adaptation (Muradova, Walker and Colli, 2020), although their potential influence at different government levels is still not fully understood.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The integration of multiple forms of knowledge leads to social learning (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge can provide essential insights into community needs and experiences of housing and urban infrastructure to inform climate adaptation, including improper waste disposal, inadequate drainage and poor sanitation, but there is significant variation in community knowledge networks (Roy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b; Douglas et al, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Waters--2017">Waters and Adger, 2017</a>). It is important to identify and address barriers to the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, such as the dominance of scientific knowledge, oppression and/or racism, and fragmentation of knowledge including gender and generational divides (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2014">Burke and Heynen, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Whyte--2017">Whyte, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Victor--2015">Victor, 2015</a>; Lövbrand <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kelly--2019">Kelly, 2019</a>).The incorporation of Indigenous knowledge in urban decision making requires a constructive dialogue with scientists and urban planners.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge have an important role to play in urban planning and management.

Learning across and between communities can be enhanced when care is taken to understand local challenges. Given power relationships, cultural needs and community aspirations, a top-down approach to information sharing is generally less effective than community partnerships and co-created knowledge at surfacing visions and strategies for getting past baked-in, unequal and unsustainable development assumptions and practices (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Clemens <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Thi Hong Phuong, Biesbroek and Wals, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fitzgerald--2016">Fitzgerald and Lenhart, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fisher--2019">Fisher and Dodman, 2019</a>). Social learning in formal and informal urban contexts is also enhanced when care is taken to ensure multiple stakeholders have opportunities to understand a variety of viewpoints, values, resources and ideals, and that these viewpoints are clearly identified in decision-making (Thi Hong Phuong, Biesbroek and Wals, 2017). However much social learning still happens only after a crisis, for example in urban water adaptation, and new knowledge is often frustrated by the lock in of powerful local institutions and groups (Johannessen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Social learning is, however, only one component of the development of climate-resilient pathways.

Projections show that by 2050, more than 50% of the population in Hindu Kush countries will live in cities (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2014">UNDESA, 2014</a>). The region is home to 10 major river basins that feed south and south-east Asia. In 2017, the total population in the 10 major river basins with their headwaters in the region was around 1.9 billion, including 240 million in the mountain and hills of the Hindu Kush (Wester <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). The region is characterised by unique mountain topography, climate, hydrology and hydrogeology. Each one of these factors plays an important role in determining the availability of water for people living in the Himalayas (Nepal, Flügel and Shrestha, 2014; Scott <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Prakash--2020">Prakash and Molden, 2020</a>). The total landmass that can support physical infrastructure for towns to develop is much less in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region as compared with the plains. Due to this physical constraint, the process of urbanisation is slow in the region. Only 3% of the total population in the region live in larger cities and 8% in smaller towns (Singh <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019b). However, there has been an increase in urbanisation, largely due to regional imbalances in providing economic opportunities for the poor. People from rural areas are flocking to the nearest urban centres in search of employment and other economic opportunities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2019">Singh and Pandey, 2019</a>). As a result, the share of urban population is increasing in the region, while that of the rural population is declining.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">One of the major challenges of urbanisation in the Himalayas is sprawling small towns with populations of under 100,000 (see Figure 6.6). These towns are expected to become major urban centres within a decade because of high growth rate. A recent study by <a class="reference-link" href="#Maharjan--2018">Maharjan et al. (2018)</a> on migration documented that 39% of rural communities have at least one migrant, of whom 80% are internal and the remaining 20% are international. Around 10% of the migration is reported as environmental displacement. Males account for the majority of the migration, which forms an important aspect of gendered vulnerability (Sugden <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Goodrich, Prakash and Udas, 2019). The ever-expanding urban population in the Himalayas generates many challenges, especially in the context of climate change adaptation. First, unplanned urbanisation is causing significant changes in land use and land cover, with recharge areas of springs being reduced. Most of the towns in Hindu Kush Himalayan region meet their water needs using supplies from springs, ponds and lakes which are largely interlinked systems. Water insecurity in hill towns are becoming the order of the day (Virk <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Bharti <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Singh <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a; Sharma <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Second, climate-induced changes in the physical environment include increased rainfall variability. Due to this, heavy rains are becoming frequent and are leading to more landslides. Third, global warming has increased the average temperature in the Himalayas which has caused glacier melt and subsequent change in hydrological regimes of the region. One of the contributing factors of glacial decline is also the deposition of black carbon (Gautam <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Gul <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021) which is contributed by burning of crop residue in Punjab (Kant <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). These critical stressors, climatic and non-climatic, are adversely affecting the socioecology of urban conglomerations in the region (Pervin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Encroachment or degradation of natural water bodies and the disappearance of traditional water systems such as springs are evident (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shah--2018">Shah and Badiger, 2018</a>; Sharma <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). While water availability in these towns has been adversely affected by the climatic and socioeconomic changes, demand for water has increased greatly (Molden, Khanal and Pradhan, 2018). Some of the towns are major tourist attractions that create a floating population in peak tourist seasons, challenging the carrying capacities of the towns. The residents must cope with water scarcity as the demand for water increases in peak seasons and water distribution through the public water supply systems becomes highly inequitable (Raina, Gurung and Suwal, 2018). The usual challenges of utilities being inefficient also applies in these areas, though it becomes much more critical as the sources of water are limited and the local geology limits the ability to access groundwater. All these processes are resulting in increased water insecurity for the poor and marginalised in urban towns of Hindu Kush (<a class="reference-link" href="#Prakash--2020">Prakash and Molden, 2020</a>). To cope with the scarcity situation, people are adapting through various means such as rationing of intra-household water access and groundwater extraction to access water supply (Virk <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Bharti <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Sharma <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). This is due to lack of long-term strategies and options provided by utilities.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer033"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" id="figure-6-006" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_6_006.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 6.6 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Urbanisation in Hindu Kush Himalayan Region. </span><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>Figure based on Singh <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang></span> et al <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang>. </span> (2019b)</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="Case"></div><h2 class="Headings_H2-unnumbered" lang="en-GB">Case Study 6.2: Semarang, Indonesia <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-28-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The City of Semarang, on the northern coast of Central Java in Indonesia, has a population of nearly 1.8 million (<a class="reference-link" href="#CBS--2019">CBS, 2019</a>). The city has experienced rapid urbanisation over last three decades, with the population almost doubling and density reaching 4650 people per square kilometre (<a class="reference-link" href="#Handayani--2014">Handayani and Rudiarto, 2014</a>; Handayani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020b). Semarang is vulnerable to sea level rise, tidal flooding and inundation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Suhelmi--2018">Suhelmi and Triwibowo, 2018</a>; Yuniartanti, Handayani and Waskitaningsih, 2016), risks which are worsened by land subsidence along the coast (Abidin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). Globally, land subsidence is a notable compounder of climate change-induced sea level rise and coastal flooding (Bagheri <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). In Semarang, the land subsidence rate is projected to be up to 60 mm yr <span class="superscript CharOverride-1" lang>−1</span> (Abidin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Bott <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Approximately 20% of the city’s coastline is characterised as extremely vulnerable because of sea level rise and enhanced land subsidence (Husnayen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), with the north-eastern portions of the city experiencing larger subsidence than the rest (Yastika, Shimizu and Abidin, 2019). Associated public health and sanitation risks are also evident, including increasing outbreaks of dengue fever and diarrhoea (Pratama <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Indonesia%20Ministry%20of%20Health--2020">Indonesia Ministry of Health, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The City of Semarang first engaged with climate change in 2009, when the Rockefeller Foundation launched the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), an initiative to develop resilience capacity across secondary and rapidly growing cities in South and Southeast Asia (Reed <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Semarang was a pilot city for ACCCRN from 2009 to 2016, when it introduced a participatory approach to planning and decision making that challenged the government-dominated tradition in the city, and in turn played a key role in Semarang’s climate adaptation and resilience planning process (Orleans Reed <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moench--2014">Moench, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kernaghan--2014">Kernaghan and Da Silva, 2014</a>).

This corresponded to a shift in framing of climate change from an environmental priority to encompassing broader development issues such as economic development, housing and infrastructure delivery. By asserting that climate change affects the operations of every critical sector across the city, the number of municipal agencies involved in climate change programming increased significantly (<a class="reference-link" href="#Setiadi--2015">Setiadi, 2015</a>). Most notably, this approach helped the municipal health agency to recognise the relationship between climate change and health (<a class="reference-link" href="#Setiadi--2015">Setiadi, 2015</a>), and helped to shift the emphasis of dengue fever management toward a more proactive community-based health early warning system (Pratama <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). In 2017, these measures helped to reduced dengue fever infection rates by 56% compared with 2011–2016 levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Indonesia%20Ministry%20of%20Health--2020">Indonesia Ministry of Health, 2020</a>). ACCCRN also supported policy experimentation through implementing rainwater harvesting facilities and a community-based flood early warning system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Archer--2015">Archer and Dodman, 2015</a>; Yuniartanti, Handayani and Waskitaningsih, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sari--2018">Sari and Prayoga, 2018</a>). These projects were designed in conjunction with national government investments in flood management infrastructure, which led to a reduction in the city’s inundated area by 24% or approximately 1% of the total urban area (<a class="reference-link" href="#Semarang%20City%20Government--2016">Semarang City Government, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Building on Semarang’s ACCCRN experience, the city then became a member of the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) programme between 2016 and 2018. As in ACCCRN, this new process emphasised stakeholder involvement, with the previous City Team recast as a team of City Resilience Officers (CRO), which was in turn led by the City Mayor and received strategic advisory support from the City Secretary. Semarang synthesised its experiences in climate adaptation planning through the <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Resilient Semarang Strategy</span> published in May 2016 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Semarang%20City%20Government--2016">Semarang City Government, 2016</a>). The <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Resilient Semarang Strategy</span> (2016) acknowledged that urban resilience must be pursued in a comprehensive and inclusive manner and highlighted 18 strategies across 6 themes: water and new energy, new economy, disaster and disease, integrated mobility, transparency of public information and competitive human resource, to be mainstreamed into the revision of the Mid-Term Regional Development Plan (RPJMD, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Daerah</span>) of 2016–2021. City Resilience Officers were formally appointed to serve on the RPJMD team, thereby formalising climate resilience as a critical item on the RPJMD programme list.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Engagement with 100RC allowed Semarang’s resilience programmes to appear on 100RC’s ‘marketplace’ of municipal projects, allowing them to be connected with bi-/multi-lateral donor resources, while continuing to align projects with goals articulated within the Mid-Term Regional Development Plan. The 100RC marketplace is a <span class="condensed_italic" lang>resilience platform</span> that showcases particular initiatives of 100RC network cities to potential <span class="condensed_italic" lang>resilience partners</span>, thereby attracting investment and donor support to Semarang’s resilience programmes. Examples include the Water as Leverage (WaL) project that has been working to conserve urban water resources in the face of climate change since 2018 (Handayani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a; Laeni <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021) and the Transboundary Flood Risk Management through Governance and Innovative Information Technology Program (TRANSFORM) that has been helping Semarang tackle flood risks beyond city boundaries through reforestation and development of dry wells and swales in upstream areas, as well as promoting cross-region dialogue (<a class="reference-link" href="#Global%20Resilience%20Partnership--2018">Global Resilience Partnership, 2018</a>). Other collaborations focused on developing resilience indicators (<a class="reference-link" href="#ARUP--2018">ARUP, 2018</a>; Rangwala <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). For example, the Zurich Flood Resilience Program implemented resilience measurement tools in 16 sub-districts along the East Flood Canal. Results of the assessment were then used to develop local disaster contingency plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rangwala--2018">Rangwala et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The conclusion of the Rockefeller Foundation’s formal engagement in Semarang in 2018 has brought forth questions about continued financial and institutional support for climate adaptation action in the city. Increasing land subsidence will also <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> overwhelm current efforts to incrementally adapt to sea level rise and coastal flooding (Abidin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). Still, the Semarang case study does highlight several key lessons for urban climate governance in secondary rapidly urbanising cities in the Global South. First, transnational institutions and partnerships are critical enablers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aisya--2019">Aisya, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Setiadi--2015">Setiadi, 2015</a>; Chu, Hughes and Mason, 2018; Handayani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a). Institutions such as the Rockefeller Foundation foster programmes and investment in the city, leverage access to adaptation funding, accelerate climate mainstreaming into wider urban sectors, and promote better knowledge management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Setiadi--2016">Setiadi, 2016</a>). However, such opportunities are also supported by the city’s ability to further mobilise its own resources in the long term and remove its dependency on the national government and transnational supporters (Handayani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a). Second, scaling up of programmes and replication of adaptation actions are increasingly important to close the gap between planning and implementation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Setiadi--2016">Setiadi, 2016</a>). It is evident that increased community empowerment and participation can help fill this gap (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hadi--2018">Hadi, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Miladan--2016">Miladan, 2016</a>), but this must also be evidence-based to ensure its applicability and effectiveness (Suarma <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Questions remain around how to determine and assess evidence-based participatory adaptation at the local level. Third, sustainable financing (from both external and internal sources) to support proposed adaptation strategies is essential as it allows for more capacity building, technology transfer and programme implementation in the long run (Handayani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a; Laeni <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hadi--2017">Hadi, 2017</a>). An example is the development of a water retention on the eastern coast of Semarang using a collaborative financing model, which helped further adaptation by protecting water resources for local industries as well as promote the idea of land value capture for community residents.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="Case"></div><h2 class="Headings_H2-unnumbered" lang="en-GB">Case Study 6.3: Institutional Innovation to Improve Urban Resilience: Xi’xian New Area in China <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-29-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Located in Northwest China and the Silk Road Economic Belt, Xi’Xian covers a total of 882 km <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> of the border zone of two cities of Xi’an and Xianyang, Shaanxi province.

SC status requires innovation to reduce flood risk through design to absorb, store and purify rainfall and storm water in an ecologically friendly way that reduces dangerous and polluted runoff. When required, the stored water is released and added to the urban water supply (<a class="reference-link" href="#MoHURD--2014">MoHURD, 2014</a>). As a CRC, the aim is to adapt to climate risk and environmental change by integrating climate resilience into urban renewal and revitalisation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In practice, building ecological cities in China has primarily focused on hard measures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2020">Li et al., 2020</a>). Key areas of development include stakeholder engagement and horizontal coordination (<a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2016">Li et al., 2016</a>). Among one of 19 national-level New Areas in China, Xi’xian enjoys special preferential policies in the fields of fiscal autonomy, investment and tax policy, and permission in land utility for industrial development purpose. These policy freedoms allow Xi’Xian to explore adaptation options. This has opened engagement with business through an urban construction investment group sponsored and invested in jointly by Xi’Xian Management Committee (administrative authority) and local enterprises (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wei--2018">Wei and Zhao, 2018</a>). Second, the municipal government has simplified administrative systems to reduce the project waiting period from evaluation to approval to 50 d. Third, a green financial mechanism creates a leverage effect for national funding, including the first provincial Green Sponge Development Fund (RMB 1.2 billion) and in Shaanxi, special funding from the Urbanization Development Fund (RMB 2.64 billion). Furthermore, a public–private partnership model with a whole-lifecycle-management approach has been introduced, raising funding of RMB 1.24 billion with a packaged project including public pipelines and sewage water treatment facilities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Such institutional and financial support have allowed Xi’xian to implement a <span class="Hyperlink" lang>Pilot Construction Plan and Three-year Action Plan for Adapting to Climate Change</span>.

Soon after, while many homes still had no electricity or roofs and the tree canopy was still bare, Puerto Ricans were faced with cascading effects including environmental health impacts from air pollution, extreme heat and mosquitoes (Ortiz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). In 2020, while still recovering, Puerto Ricans experienced earthquakes, extreme African dust events, intense coastal and urban floods, and the COVID-19 pandemic (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keck--2020">Keck, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#NASA%20Explore%20Earth--2020">NASA Explore Earth, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#NASA/JPL-Caltech--2020">NASA/JPL-Caltech, 2020</a>). These events continue to unveil unresolved conditions of social vulnerability and its root causes in economic poverty, social inequities, aged and deteriorating infrastructure, and population loss (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bonilla--2019">Bonilla and LeBrón, 2019</a>). Combined with limited past investment in climate change adaptation and underlying governance challenges including corruption, bankruptcy and political crisis (Holladay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), this has constrained a more CRD for Puerto Rico.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">It is in this context that government, academic institutions and local civil society have taken important steps and often joint action toward mitigation and adaptation. Federal funding included USD 20 billion of disaster recovery funding with USD 8 billion allocated for adaptation and resilience projects, such as flood risk mitigation. During the year 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved USD 13 billion to rebuild the power grid and education system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Delgado--2020">Delgado, 2020</a>). These programmes allow communities and local governments to plan and implement strategies and build new infrastructure that reduces risks and builds long-term adaptive capacities. The Government of Puerto Rico also approved two key climate adaptation policies in 2019. The Puerto Rico Mitigation, Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change Law (Law 33, Senate Bill PS 773) established, for the first time in the island’s history, a legal framework that acknowledges that the climate is changing and threatens the quality of life. The law recognises important scientific projections for the island, including an increase of 0.5 to 1 m in sea levels by 2015, maximum temperatures of up 2.5°C and precipitation decrease of up to 50% by 2100 (Gould <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). The law generated the formation of an Expert and Advisory Committee on Climate Change to develop the plan with specific recommendations and present it to the Legislature within a year of the passing of the law in 2020. Along with strategies to specifically protect and build the resilience of urban and rural communities to future climate disasters, the law establishes SDGs, including water and food security, urban planning and densification, and transition to renewable and alternative forms of energy. The energy target is reinforced by another key state policy approved in 2019 in response to the failed energy infrastructure during Hurricane María, the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (Senate Bill PS 1121). This law calls for a transition to 100% renewable and alternative energy by 2050.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Puerto Rico has a strong science base that produced extensive knowledge on climate change and sustainability long before Hurricane María. The Puerto Rico Climate Change Council has collected and synthesised scientific information for Puerto Rico since before its formation in 2009. Many Puerto Rican scientists were also editors and authors on Chapter 20: US Caribbean Region for 4th US National Climate Assessment (Gould <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). The National Institute of Island Energy and Sustainability (INESI in Spanish) recently published a catalogue with more than 60 scientists and experts working on energy and sustainability innovations in the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) system. The scientific community became very active after the hurricane in efforts to empower local groups and communities to build more sustainable and resilient futures. UPR environmental health scientists worked with communities to design and implement risk reduction action plans, including NBS , through the Community Climate Actions Plans and the Puerto Rico Community Resiliency Initiative sponsored by Fundación Comunitaria de Puerto Rico and Education Development Center-Regional Education Laboratories, Northeast and Islands. A successful example of these alliances is the development of the first solar power community in Toro Negro, Puerto Rico. These initiatives were inspired by principles of human-centred design, a problem-solving approach that starts with the people impacted the most by the problem to be solved. In San Juan, the capital and major urban centre of the island, scientists from UPR and the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry worked with local stakeholders and communities to develop sustainable and transformative urban futures with the support of the Urban Resilience to Extreme Events Sustainability Research Network (UREx SRN). The UREx SRN is a knowledge network of 10 cities in the USA and Latin America and 20 other institutions building scientific knowledge, models and participatory tools to build resilience and transformative capacities for cities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Perhaps the greatest source of adaptive capacity that emerged after the hurricane came from the civic sector and community-based organisations, and local residents. Hundreds of non-profit and grassroots organisations became active in disaster recovery and are now catalysing actions to advance social transformation and sustainable development. In the energy sector, numerous communities and NGOs developed new action plans to promote transitions to renewable energy and community-based microgrids, such as the Queremos Sol initiative (<a href="https://www.queremossolpr.com/">https://www.queremossolpr.com/</a>), and the establishment of solar panels in community centres and residences by the Puerto Rico Community Foundation and Resilient Power Puerto Rico. The San Juan Bay Estuary Program, an NGO in the San Juan metropolitan area, launched alongside the Clinton Global Initiative the development of a watershed-based multi-jusrisdictional hazard mitigation plan, the first watershed-based plan for the metro region. The organisation has established resilience hubs to support the community with critical resources, communications and energy supply during an emergency. In many of the most isolated areas across the island where government aid did not reach them for months, the communities that self-organised during recovery are also leading examples of community social–ecological resilience. In Utuado, one of the hardest hit areas by the hurricane, their main community organisation known as COSSAO (Corporación de Servicios de Salud y Desarrollo Socioeconómico, El Otoao) emerged from the hurricane with a strong and holistic sustainable development vision, the Tetuan Reborn initiative, to improve the socioeconomic status and health of community members while building capacity for disaster resilience through various initiatives. The long-term outcome of this initiative is to support efforts toward self-empowerment within neighbourhoods by identifying and designing viable solutions to hurricane-related and economic development challenges specific to the local context, including constructing a primary health care clinic, a public health promoter programme, pursuing farms rehabilitation, and promoting agritourism, agrotherapy and education (Holladay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation efforts, however, continue to face many governance hurdles. Up to 2020, only 2–3% of the USD 20 million Federal Government recovery funds had been spent with hundreds of families that lost their homes or roofs in 2017 yet to receive the help they need (<a class="reference-link" href="#Col%C3%B3n%20Almenas--2020">Colón Almenas, 2020</a>). Lack of administrative capacities, coordination across sectors and efforts, transparency and accountability are some of the governance barriers that keep recovery and transformation efforts from materialising (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lamba%20Nieves--2020">Lamba Nieves and Marxuach, 2020</a>). Puerto Ricans are now contending with the reality that the disaster they are experiencing is not an outcome of a singular event but of multiple hazards converging with pre-existing vulnerabilities and low adaptive capacities creating severe multi-hazard risk to the island (Eakin, Muñoz-Erickson and Lemos, 2018; Gould <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Many Puerto Ricans now question when the disaster began and when it ended because they have been living in a state of chronic crisis (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bonilla--2019">Bonilla and LeBrón, 2019</a>).</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="Case"></div><h2 class="Headings_H2-unnumbered" lang="en-GB">Case Study 6.5: Climate-Resilient Pathways in Informal Settlements in Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-31-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Informal settlements account for over three-quarters of residential areas in sub-Saharan Africa and have grown rapidly over the last three decades (<a class="reference-link" href="#Visagie--2020">Visagie and Turok, 2020</a>).

These examples show how local knowledge and capacity, engagement of policymakers in meaningful ways with residents of informal communities, and institutional change, can combine to deliver adaptation outcomes at a city scale (Kareem <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Despite their diversity and differences across the continent (Kovacic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), informal settlements are frequently located in hazard-prone areas, with residents living in precarious housing conditions on marginal lands (Badmos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kironde--2016">Kironde, 2016</a>), lacking essential services and risk-reducing infrastructure, and often developing outside the legal systems intended to record land tenure and ownership (Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Adelekan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Consequently, they are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and the urban poor residents suffer disproportionate burdens and losses from natural hazards, which undermines urban resilience (Williams <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Recent impacts from flooding have brought wide-spread devastation to urban poor residents in major coastal urban centres including Accra, Lagos, Freetown, Maputo and Dar es Salaam, resulting in injury and death, displacement of people, loss of assets, destruction of public infrastructure and disruption to livelihoods and economies (Douglas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2008; <a class="reference-link" href="#Adelekan--2010">Adelekan, 2010</a>; Yankson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Allen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Flooding and long-term inundation also lead the spread of diseases and health risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sverdlik--2011">Sverdlik, 2011</a>; Zerbo, Delgado and González, 2020). Climate change will also bring stresses such as city-wide reductions in freshwater availability, and heatwaves that have particularly severe consequences for residents of poorly built homes in informal settlements (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Kayaga <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Wilby <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In response to these risks, a wide range of adaptation efforts have been implemented in cities across sub-Saharan Africa (Hunter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). In Freetown, informal settlement residents have led data generation efforts that capture the value of local knowledge in understanding climate risk. Through partnerships with NGOs and research institutions, informal settlement residents have mapped climate hazard hotspots using geo-referenced tools, producing both digital and hardcopy outputs that serve as a blueprint for climate-informed community development discourses (Allen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020b; Visman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Similarly, residents of informal settlements in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, have profiled community climate and health risks by using an adaptation of the ‘Action at the Frontline’ methodology developed by the Global Network of Civil Society Organisations for Disaster Reduction (GNDR). Locally informed risk profiles support the development of community action plans based on prioritisation and ranking of scaled-down interventions that communities can collectively do on their own (Osuteye <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). This process highlights the lived experiences of climate change, and allows communities to develop deliberation spaces, communal solidarity and cohesion, and share adaptation strategies (Sakijege <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Such sharing and peer-to-peer learning is particularly useful because adaptive capacities are unevenly distributed among exposed populations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ajibade--2014">Ajibade and McBean, 2014</a>). The community-generated assessments and data consider the range of environmental, socioeconomic and political factors that contribute to a better understanding of how climate change affects the vulnerability of low-income urban residents, and how this changes over time.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Data that is generated and owned by residents of informal settlements provides a basis for making the risks facing these neighbourhoods more visible to city planners, and for enabling collaboration between a range of urban stakeholders (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dobson--2017">Dobson, 2017</a>). In Freetown, this process has been led by the Federation of the Urban and Rural Poor (FEDURP) and the Centre for Dialogue on Human Settlement and Poverty Alleviation (CODOHSAPA). The FEDURP belongs to the global Slum Dwellers International network, committed to empowering poor residents in urban spaces, and has a presence in several other African cities (Macarthy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). With the support of CODOHSAPA, FEDURP coordinates community development committees (CDC) and community disaster management committees (CDMC) in nearly all the informal settlements in the city. Both CODOHSAPA and FEDURP work closely with the local research institution, the Sierra Leone Urban Research Centre (SLURC). SLURC has played an essential role in curating spaces for continuous learning and relationship-building between FEDURP and community residents, including the formation of ‘Community Learning Platforms’ (CLP) for mixed groups of community actors (<a class="reference-link" href="#City%20Learning%20Platform--2019">City Learning Platform, 2019</a>) to build their capacities to address climate risk collectively. This is done by drawing on the data, agency and mobilisation potential of community organisations in informal settlements. In the coastal settlement of Cockle Bay at the western end of the city, uncontrolled traditional land reclamation (‘banking’) along the shores progressively exposed residents to perennial floods from tidal surges, and the settlement received regular threats of evictions from city authorities. However, residents have drawn on their climate risk knowledge and hazard profiling to self-manage a process of action planning resulting in a decision to prohibit further land reclamation. It also identified and demarcated an exterior boundary of the settlement and planned and constructed new drainage channels to carry away runoff water within the community (Allen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The community organisations have subsequently successfully negotiated with the Ministry of Environment to formalise this new exterior boundary, which has led to the authorities dropping their threats of evictions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The approach taken in Freetown demonstrates a pathway to adaptation that is based on a more people-centred approach to urban planning that understands the aspirations of urban residents, addresses climate risk and advances sustainable development (Woodcraft <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Fraser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). It further provides an example of the ways in which different sources and scales of data can be co-produced (Kovacic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) and targeted interventions can be co-designed with community residents (Musango <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). The community-generated data on climate and health risks and the subsequent strategic action plans developed through local community organisations’ work have been recognised and incorporated into a new city-wide initiative led by the Office of the Mayor, dubbed Transform Freetown (Allen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a). The action has expanded the political space for the urban poor’s collectives to strategically engage in urban resilience planning, highlighting the value and potential of participatory processes and community-generated data.</p></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="cross-working-group-box-urban"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Cross-Working-Group Box URBAN | Cities and Climate Change</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-39-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Authors: Xuemei Bai (Australia), Vanesa Castán Broto (UK/Spain), Winston Chow (Singapore), Felix Creutzig (Germany), David Dodman (Jamaica/UK), Rafiq Hamdi (Belgium), Bronwyn Hayward (New Zealand), Şiir Kılkış (Turkey), Shuaib Lwasa (Uganda), Timon McPhearson (USA), Minal Pathak (India), Mark Pelling (UK), Diana Reckien (Germany), Karen Seto (USA), Ayyoob Sharifi (Japan/Iran), Diána Ürge-Vorsatz (Hungary)</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Introduction</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">This Cross-Working Group Box on Cities and Climate Change responds to the critical role of urbanisation as a megatrend impacting climate adaptation and mitigation.

Between 2000 and 2015, the global population in locations that were affected by floods grew by 58–86 million (Tellman et al., 2021). The direct economic costs of all extreme events reached USD 210–268 billion in 2020 (Aon, 2021) or about USD 0.7 billion d <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>-1</span>; this figure does not include knock-on costs in supply chains or days off work lost so that the actual economic costs could be far higher. Depending on RCP, between half (RCP2.6) and three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Temperatures and the Urban Heat Island" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.2.1">Section 6.2.2.1</a>; WGII Figure 6.3; Mora <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Zhao <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Huang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The interdependencies between infrastructure, services and networks driven by urban production and consumption mean that urban systems are now global; remittance flows and investments reach into rural places shaping natural resource use far from the city and bring risk to the city when these places are impacted by climate change. This urbanisation megatrend (Kourtit, Nijkamp and Scholten, 2015) amplifies and shapes the potential impacts of climate events. It provides the economic and institutional framework for integrating the aims and approaches that can deliver mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Zscheischler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Dawson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Tsavdaroglou <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). For cities facing flood damage, wide-ranging impacts have been recorded on other urban areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2021">Simpson et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2021">Carter et al., 2021</a>) as production and trade is disrupted (Shughrue et al., 2020). In the absence of integrated mitigation and adaptation across and between infrastructure systems and local places, impacts that bring urban economies to a standstill can extend into supply chains or across energy networks causing power outages.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Urban settlements are drivers of climate change, generating about 70% of global CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span>-eq emissions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (WGI Box TS.14; WGIII 8 ES; WGII 6.1, WGII 6.2). This global impact feeds back to cities through the exposure of infrastructure, people and business to the impacts of climate-related hazards. Especially in the larger cities, this climate feedback is exacerbated by local choices in urban design, land use, building design and human behaviour (Viguié<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020) that shape local environmental conditions. Local and global conditions influence the nature of hazards in urban centres: urban form can add up to 2°C to warming, concretisation of open space can increase runoff and building height and orientation influences wind direction and strength (WGII 6.3).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Building today for resilience and lower emissions is far easier than retrofitting tomorrow. As urbanisation unfolds, its legacy continues to be the locking in of emissions and vulnerabilities (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Ürge-Vorsatz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Seto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Retrofitting, disaster reconstruction and urban regeneration programmes offer scope for strategic direction changes to low-carbon and high-resilience urban form and function if they are inclusive in design and implementation. Rapid urban growth means new investment, new buildings and infrastructure, new demands for energy and transport and new questions about what a healthy and fulfilling urban life can be. The USD 90 trillion expected to be invested in new urban development by 2030 (NCE, 2018), is a global opportunity to place adaptation and mitigation directly into urban infrastructure and planning, and social policy including education and health care and environmental management (Ürge-Vorsatz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). If this opportunity is missed, if business as usual urbanisation persists, then social and physical vulnerability will be not be so easily confronted.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The benefits of actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate stressors diminish with delayed action, indicating the necessity for rapid responses. Delaying the same actions for increasing the resilience of infrastructure from 2020 to 2030 is estimated to have a median cost of at least USD 1 trillion (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2019">Hallegatte et al., 2019</a>), while also missing the carbon emissions reductions required in the narrowing window of opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5°C (WGI). In contrast, taking integrated actions toward mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development will provide multiple benefits for the health and well-being of urban inhabitants and avoid stranded assets (WGII 6.3, WGII 17; WGIII 5; WGIII 8.2; Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer034"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Working Group Box</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">The Policy-Action Gap: Urban Low-Carbon and Climate Resilient Development</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Cities are critical places to realise actions on both adaptation and mitigation simultaneously, with potential co-benefits that extend far beyond cities (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Göpfert, Wamsler and Lang, 2019). Given rapid changes in the built environment, transforming the use of materials and the land intensiveness of urban development including in many parts of the Global South in the next decades will be critical, as well as mainstreaming low-carbon development principles in new urban development in all regions. Much of this development will be self-built and ‘informal’, and new modes of governance and planning will be required to engage with this. Integrating mitigation and adaptation now rather than later, through reshaping patterns of urban development and associated decision making processes, is a prerequisite for attaining resilient and zero carbon cities.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">While more cities have developed plans for climate adaptation and mitigation since AR5, many remain to be implemented (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Araos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Olazabal--2021">Olazabal and De Gopegui, 2021</a>; Aguiar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). A review of local climate mitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the European Union suggests mitigation plans are more common than adaptation plans, and that city size, national legislation and international networks can influence the development of local climate plans with an estimated 80% of cities with above 500,000 inhabitants having a mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Integrated approaches to tackle common drivers of emissions and cascading risks provide the basis for strengthening synergies across mitigation and adaptation, and managing possible trade-offs with sustainable development (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence, medium agreement </span>) (Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Landauer, Juhola and Klein, 2019). Analysis of 315 local authority emission reduction plans across the European Union reveals that the most common policies cover municipal assets and structures (Palermo et al. 2020). Estimates of emission reductions by non-state and sub-state actors in 10 high-emitting economies projected GHG emissions in 2030 would be 1.2–2.0 GtCO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span>-eq per year or 3.8–5.5% lower compared to scenario projections for current national policies (31.6–36.8 GtCO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span>-eq per year) if the policies are fully implemented and do not change the pace of action elsewhere (Kuramochi et al. 2020). The value of integrating mitigation and adaptation is underscored in the opportunities for decarbonising existing urban areas, and investing in social, ecological and technological infrastructure resilience (WGII 6.4). Integrating mitigation and adaption is challenging (Landauer, Juhola and Klein, 2019) but can provide multiple benefits for the health and well-being of urban inhabitants (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sharifi--2020">Sharifi, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Effective climate strategies combine mitigation and adaptation responses, including through linking adaptive urban land use with GHG emission reductions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Xu et al., 2019; Patterson et al., 2021). For example, urban green and blue infrastructure can provide co-benefits for mitigation and adaptation (Ürge-Vorsatz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018) and is an important entry point for integrating adaptation and mitigation at the urban level (Frantzeskaki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Grey and physical infrastructure such as sea defences can immediately reduce risk, but can also transfer risk and limit future options. Social policy interventions including social safety nets provide financial security for the most at risk and can manage vulnerability determined both by specific hazards and independently. Hazard-independent mechanisms for vulnerability reduction, such as population-wide social security, provide resilience in the face of unanticipated cascading impacts or surprise and novel climate-related hazard exposure. Social interventions can also support, or be led by, ambitions to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Archer--2016">Archer, 2016</a>). Climate resilient development invites planners to plan interventions and monitor the effectiveness of outcomes beyond individual projects and across wider remits that reach into sustainable development. Curbing the emission impacts of urban activities to reach net zero in the next decades while improving the resilience of urban areas necessitates an integrated response now.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Key gaps in knowledge include urban enabling environment; how smaller settlements, low-income communities living in slums and informal settlements, but also those in rental housing spread across the city, and actions to reduce supply chain risk can be supported to accelerate equitable and sustainable adaptation in the face of financial and governance constraints (Birkmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dulal--2019">Dulal, 2019</a>; Rosenzweig <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer035"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Working Group Box</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Enabling Action</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Innovative governance and finance solutions are required to manage complex and interconnected risks across essential key infrastructures, networks and services and meet basic human needs in urban areas (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (Moser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Colenbrander, Dodman and Mitlin, 2018). There are many examples of ‘ready-to-use’ policy tools, technologies and practical interventions for policymakers seeking to act on adaptation and mitigation (Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bisaro--2018">Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chirambo--2021">Chirambo, 2021</a>). Tax and fiscal incentives for business and individuals can help support city-wide change behaviour toward low carbon and risk reducing choices. Change can start where governments have most control; in public sector institutions and investment, but the challenge ahead requires partnership with private sector and community actors acting at scale and with accountability. Urban climate governance and finance needs to address urban inequalities at the forefront if the urban opportunity is to realise the ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Increasing investment at pace will put pressure on governance capability and transparency and accountability of decision making (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (WG II 6.6.4.5). Urban climate action that actively includes local actors and is built on an evidence base open to independent scrutiny is more likely to avoid unintended, negative maladaptive impacts and mobilise a wide range of local capacities. In the long run, this is also more likely to carry public support, even if some experiments and investments do not deliver the intended social benefits. Legislation, technical capacity and governance capability is required to be able to absorb additional finance. About USD 384 billion yr <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>-1</span> of climate finance has been invested in urban areas in recent years. This remains at about 10% of the annual climate finance that would be necessary for low-carbon and resilient urban development (Negreiros et al., 2021). Rapid deployment of funds to stimulate economies in recovery from COVID-19 have highlighted the pitfalls of funding expansion ahead of policy innovation and capacity building. The result can be an intensification of existing urban forms, exactly the kinds of choices and preferences that contribute to risk creation and its concentration among those with little public voice or economic power.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Iterative and experimental approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation decision making co-generated in partnership with communities, can advance climate-resilient decarbonisation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (Caldarice, Tollin and Pizzorni, 2021; Culwick <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20der%20Heijden--2021">van der Heijden and Hong, 2021</a>). Conditions of complexity, uncertainty and constrained resources require innovative solutions which are both adaptive and anticipatory. Complex interactions among multiple agents in times of uncertainty makes decision making about social, economic, governance, and infrastructure choices challenges, and can lead decision makers to postpone action. This is the case for those balancing household budgets, residential investment portfolios and city-wide policy responsibilities. Living with climate change requires changes to business-as-usual design making. Co-design and collaboration with communities through iterative policy experimentation can point the way toward CRD pathways (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ata%C3%B6v--2021">Ataöv and Peker, 2021</a>). Key to successful learning is transparency in policymaking, inclusive policy processes and robust local modelling, monitoring and evaluation, which are not yet widely undertaken (Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Sanchez Rodriguez, Ürge-Vorsatz and Barau, 2018).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The diversity of cities’ experiences of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies brings an advantage for those city government and other actors willing to ‘learn together’ (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Haupt--2019">Haupt and Coppola, 2019</a>). While contexts are varied, policy options are often similar enough for the sharing of experiments and policy champions. Sharing expertise can build on existing regional and global networks, many of which have already placed knowledge, learning and capacity building at the centre of their agendas. Learning from innovative forms of governance and financial investment, and strengthening co-production of policy through inclusive access to knowledge and resources, can help address mismatches in local capacities, strengthen wider Sustainable Development Goals and COVID-19 Recovery agendas (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>). Perceptions of risk can greatly influence the reallocation of capital and shift financial resources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2021">Battiston et al., 2021</a>). Coupling mitigation and adaptation in an integrated approach offers opportunities to enhance efficiency, increases the coherence of urban climate action, generates cost savings and provides opportunities to reinvest the savings into new climate action projects to make all urban areas and regions more resilient.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Local governments play an important role in driving climate action across mitigation and adaptation as managers of assets, regulators, mobilisers and catalysts of action, but few cities are undertaking transformative climate adaptation or mitigation actions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement) </span> (Heikkinen, Ylä-Anttila and Juhola, 2019). Local actors are providers of infrastructure and services, regulators of zoning, and can be conveners and champions of an integrated approach for mitigation and adaptation at multiple levels (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). New opportunities in governance and finance can enable cities to pool resources together and aggregate interventions to innovate ways of mobilising urban climate finance at scale (White and Wahbah, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2019">Simpson et al., 2019</a>; Colenbrander, Dodman and Mitlin, 2018). However, research increasingly points toward the difficulties faced during the implementation of climate financing <span class="condensed_italic" lang>in situ</span>, such as the fragmentation of structures of governance capable of managing large investments effectively (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mohammed--2019">Mohammed et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Scaling up transformative place-based action for both adaptation and mitigation requires enabling conditions including land-based financing, intermediaries and local partnerships (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tirumala--2021">Tirumala and Tiwari, 2021</a>; ). Governance structures that combine actors working at different levels with different mixes of tools are effective in addressing challenges related to implementation of integrated action, while cross-sectoral coordination is necessary (<a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2020">Singh et al., 2020</a>). Joint institutionalisation of mitigation and adaptation in local governance structures can also enable integrated action (<a class="reference-link" href="#G%C3%B6pfert--2020">Göpfert et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hurlimann--2021">Hurlimann et al., 2021</a>). However, the proportion of international finance that reaches local recipients remains low, despite the repeated focus of climate policy on place-based adaptation and mitigation (Manuamorn, 2019). Green financing instruments that enable local climate action without exacerbating current forms of inequality can jointly address mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. Climate finance that also reaches beyond non-state enterprises, including SMEs, communities and NGOs, and is responsive to the needs of urban inhabitants, including disabled individuals and different races or ethnicities, is essential for inclusive and resilient urban development (Colenbrander, Dodman and Mitlin, 2018<a class="reference-link" href="#Frenova--2020)">Frenova, 2020)</a>. Developing networks that can exert climate action at scale is another priority for climate finance.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The urbanisation megatrend is an opportunity to transition global society. Enabling urban governance to avert cascading risk and achieve low-carbon, resilient development will involve co-production of policy and planning, rapid implementation and greater cross-sector coordination, monitoring and evaluation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement) </span> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grafakos--2019">Grafakos et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Giulio--2018">Di Giulio et al., 2018</a>). New constellations of responsible actors are required to manage hybrid local-city or cross-city risk management and decarbonisation initiatives (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>). These may increasingly benefit from linkages across more urban and more rural space as recognition of cascading and systemic risk brings recognition of supply chains, remittance flows and migration trends as vectors of risk and resilience. Urban governance will be better prepared in planning, prioritising and financing the kind of measures that can reduce GHG emissions and improve resilience at scale and pace when considering a view of cascading risks and carbon lock-ins globally, while acting locally to address local limitations and capacities, including the needs and priorities of urban citizens (Colenbrander, Dodman and Mitlin, 2018).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer036"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Working Group Box</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_head" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-8-siblings"></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 6.1"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 6.1 | Why and how are cities, settlements and different types of infrastructure especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-40-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Cities, settlements and infrastructure become vulnerable when investment decisions fail to take the risks of climate change fully into account. Such failures can result from a lack of understanding, competing priorities, a lack of finance or access to appropriate technology. Around the world, smaller cities and poorer populations are often most vulnerable and suffer the most over time, while large cities can register the greatest losses to individual events. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The world is urban. Billions of people live in towns and cities. Hardly anyone, even in remote rural locations, is separated from the flows of trade that connect the world and are held together by networks of transport and communication infrastructure systems. Connected networks once broken can cascade out, multiplying impacts across urban and rural areas. When major manufacturing centres or regionally important ports are impacted, global trade suffers. For example, flooding in Bangkok in 2011 led to a global shortage in semiconductors and a slowdown in global computer manufacturing.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Despite cities generating wealth, additional vulnerability to climate change is being created in urban areas every day. Demographic change, social and economic pressures, and governance failures that drive inequality and marginality mean that increasing numbers of people who live in towns and cities are exposed to flooding, temperature extremes and water or food insecurity. This leads to an adaptation gap, where rich neighbourhoods can afford strategies to reduce vulnerability while poorer communities are unable to do the same. Although this would be so even without a changing climate, climate change increases the variability and extremes of weather, exposing more people, businesses and buildings to floods and other events. The combination of rising vulnerability and increasing exposure translates to a growth in the number of people and properties at risk from climate change in cities worldwide.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Around the world, vulnerability is rising but differs considerably between and within urban areas. Settlements of up to 1 million people are the most rapidly expanding and also among the most vulnerable. These settlements often have limited community level organisation and might not have a dedicated local government. Coping with rapid population growth under conditions of climate change and constrained capacity is a major challenge. For large cities, multiple local governments and well-organised community-based organisations interact with large businesses and national political parties in a complicated cocktail of interests that can interfere with planning and action to reduce vulnerability.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">For the poorest living in urban slums, informal settlements or renting across the city, lack of secure tenure and inadequate access to basic services compound vulnerability. But even the wealthy in large cities are not fully protected from climate change-related shocks. Just like breaks in infrastructure between towns and rural settlements, big city infrastructure can be broken by even local landslides, floods or temperature events, with consequences cascading across the city. Electricity blackouts are the most common and can affect water pumping, traffic regulation and streetlights, as well as hospitals, schools and homes. Still, it is the urban poor and marginalised who experience the greatest exposure, most vulnerability and least capacity to cope.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Rounds of exposure and impact can reduce the capacity of survivors to cope with future events. As a result, the already vulnerable and exposed become more vulnerable over time, increasing urban inequalities. But this need not be the case. Focussing on vulnerability reduction is not easy, it requires joined-up action across social and economic development sectors, together with critical infrastructure planning. It often also means partnering local government with informal and community-based actors. But there is considerable experience globally on what works and how to deliver reduced vulnerability for the urban poor and for cities as a whole. The challenge is to scale up this experience and accelerate its application to keep pace with climate change and address the adaptation gap.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 6.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 6.2 | What are the key climate risks faced by cities, settlements and vulnerable populations today, and how will these risks change in a mid-century (2050) 2°C warmer world?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-41-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate change will interact with the changing physical environment in cities and settlements to create or exacerbate a range of risks. Rising temperatures and heatwaves will cause human illness and morbidity, as well as infrastructure degradation and failures, while heavy rainfall and sea level rise will worsen flooding. Low-income groups and other vulnerable populations will be affected most severely because of where they live and their limited ability to cope with these stresses. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Cities and settlements are constantly changing. Their populations grow and shrink, economic activities expand or decline, and political priorities shift. The risks that cities and their residents face are influenced by both urban change and climate change. The seriousness of these risks into the 21st Century will be shaped by the interactions between drivers of change including population growth, economic development and land use change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In a warming world, increasing air temperature makes the urban heat island effect in cities worse. One key risk is heatwaves in cities that are <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to affect half of the future global urban population, with negative impacts on human health and economic productivity. Heat and built infrastructure such as streets and houses interact with each other and magnify risks in cities. For instance, higher urban temperatures can cause infrastructure to overheat and fail, as well as increase the concentration of harmful air pollutants such as ozone.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The density of roads and buildings in urban areas increases the area of impermeable surfaces, which interact with more frequent heavy precipitation events to increase the risk of urban flooding. This risk of flooding is greater for coastal settlements due to sea level rise and storm surges from tropical cyclones. Coastal inundation in the Miami-Dade region in Florida, USA, is estimated to have caused over USD 465 million in lost real estate value between 2005 and 2016, and it is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> that coastal flood risks in the region beyond 2050 will increase without adaptation to climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Within cities, different groups of people can face different risks. Many low-income residents live in informal settlements alongside coasts or rivers, which greatly heightens exposure and vulnerability to climate-driven hazards. In urban areas in Ghana, for example, risks from urban flooding can compound health risks, and have resulted in outbreaks of malaria, typhoid and cholera. Those outbreaks have been shown to disproportionately affect poorer communities.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Severe risks in cities and settlements also arise from reduced water availability. As urban areas grow, the amount of water required to meet basic needs of people and industries increases. When increased demand is combined with water scarcity from lower rainfall due to climate change, water resource management becomes a critical issue. Low-income groups already face major challenges in accessing water, and the situation is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to worsen due to growing conflicts over scarce resources, increasing water prices and diminishing infrastructure provisions in ever-expanding informal settlements.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">These key risks already differ greatly between cities, and between different groups of people in the same city. By 2050, these discrepancies are likely to be even more apparent. Cities with limited financial resources, regulatory authority and technical capacities are less equipped to respond to climate change. People who already have fewer resources and constrained opportunities face higher levels of risk because of their vulnerability. As a result of this, key risks vary not only over time as climate change is felt more strongly, but also over space, between cities exposed to different hazards and with different abilities to adapt, and between social groups, meaning between people who are more or less affected and able to cope.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 6.3"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 6.3 | What adaptation actions in human settlements can contribute to reducing climate risks and building resilience across building, neighbourhood, city and global scales?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-42-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Settlements bring together many activities, so climate action will be most effective if it is integrated and collaborative. This requires (i) embedding information on climate change risks into decisions; (ii) building capacity of communities and institutions; (iii) using both nature-based and traditional engineering approaches; (iv) working in partnership with diverse local planning and community organisations; and (v) sharing best practice with other settlements. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Settlements bring together people, buildings, economic activities and infrastructure services, and thus integrated, cross-sector, adaptation actions offer the best way to build resilience to climate change impacts. For example, actions to manage flood risk include installing flood proofing measures within and outside properties, improving capacity of urban drainage along roads, incorporating nature-based solutions (NbS) within the urban areas, constructing flood defences and managing land upstream of settlements to reduce runoff.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Adaptation actions will be more effective if they are implemented in partnership with local communities, national governments, research institutions, and the private and third sector. Climate action should not be considered as an additional or side action to other activities. Rather, climate action should be mainstreamed into existing processes, including those that contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (2015) and New Urban Agenda adopted at the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in 2016. Cities are already coming together through international networks to share good practice about adaptation actions, speeding up the dissemination of knowledge.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">This integrated approach to adaptation in human settlements needs to be supported by various other actions, including potential co-benefits with carbon emissions reductions, public health and ecosystem conservation goals. First, information on climate risks needs to be embedded into the architectural design, delivery and retrofitting of housing, transportation, spatial planning and infrastructure across neighbourhood and city scales. This includes making information on climate impacts widely available, updating design standards and strengthening regulation to avoid development in high-risk locations. Second, the capacity of communities needs to be strengthened, especially among those in informal settlements, the poorest and other vulnerable groups including minorities, migrants, women, children, elderly, disabled and people with serious health conditions such as obesity. This involves raising awareness, incorporating communities into adaptation processes, and strengthening regulation, policies and provision of infrastructure services. Third, nature-based solutions should be integrated to work alongside traditional ‘grey’ or engineered infrastructure. Vegetation corridors, greenspace, wetlands and other green infrastructure can be woven into the built environment to reduce heat and flood risks, whilst providing other benefits such as health and biodiversity.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Although even the largest city covers only a small area of the planet, all settlements are part of larger catchments from which people, water, food, energy, materials and other resources support them. Actions within cities should be mindful of wider impacts and avoid displacing issues elsewhere.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 6.4"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 6.4 | How can actions that reduce climate risks in cities and settlements also help to reduce urban poverty, enhance economic performance and contribute to climate mitigation?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-43-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>If carefully planned, adaptation actions can reduce exposure to climate risk and reduce urban poverty, advance sustainable development and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. When adaptation responses are equitable, and if a range of voices are heard in the planning process, the needs of the disadvantaged are more likely to be addressed and wider societal benefits can be maximised. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Urbanisation is a global trend which is interacting with climate change to create complex risks in cities and settlements, especially for those that already have high levels of poverty, unemployment, housing informality and backlogs of services. Many cities and settlements are seeing increasing action to manage climate risks. On top of reducing communities’ exposure to climate risk, adaptation actions can have benefits for reducing urban poverty and enhancing economic performance in ways that reduce inequality and advance sustainability goals. Adaptation actions, however, can also have unintended consequences. That is why care needs to be taken to ensure climate adaptation planning and development of new infrastructure does not exacerbate inequality or negatively impact other sustainable development priorities. Climate adaptation planning is most effective when it is sensitive to the diverse ways that low-income and minority communities are more <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to experience climate risk, including women, children, migrants, refugees, internally displaced peoples and racial/ethnic minority groups, among others.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Adapting to climate change can have benefits for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and urban inequalities. In cities where growing numbers of people live in informal settlements, introducing risk-reducing physical infrastructure such as piped water, sanitation and drainage systems can enhance the quality of life of the community. At the same time, those measures can increase health outcomes and reduce urban inequalities by reducing exposure to flooding or heat impacts. In less developed countries, less than 60% of the urban population have access to piped water which, in turn, impacts their health and well-being. Increasingly, housing is being built better to manage heat risk through insulation or changing building orientation, or to flood risk by raising structures, which then contributes to well-being and ability to work. Improvements to early warning systems can help people evacuate rapidly in case of storm surges or flooding. Although the most vulnerable often do not get these warnings in time.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Carefully planned nature-based solutions (NbS), such as public green space, improved urban drainage systems and storm water management, can deliver both health and development benefits. When these adaptation actions succeed, water, waste and sanitation can be improved to better manage climate risk and provide households and cities with better services. Many nature-based solutions entail bringing back plants and trees into cities, which also helps to reduce the concentration of heat-trapping GHGs in the atmosphere.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">When care is taken to ensure that adaptation responses are equitable, and that a range of voices are heard in planning, the needs of the disadvantaged are more likely to be addressed. For example, a study that looked at transport plans across 40 cities in Portugal saw that some urban communities have prioritised the needs of disadvantaged users such as the elderly and disabled, while at the same time reducing urban transport emissions and enhancing public well-being and equity of transport. On the other hand, in some cities, there is evidence of emerging trade-offs associated with climate adaptation actions where sea walls and temporary flood barriers were erected in economically valuable areas and not is less well-off areas. Going forward, it is important to ensure that vulnerable groups’ needs are carefully considered, both in terms of climate and other risks, as this has not been sufficiently done in the past.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 6.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 6.5 | What policy tools, governance strategies and financing arrangements can enable more inclusive and effective climate adaptation in cities and settlements?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-44-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Inclusive and effective climate adaptation requires efforts at all levels of governance, including the public sector, the private sector, the third sector, communities and intermediaries such as universities or think tanks. Inclusive and effective adaptation requires action fit for the diverse conditions in which it is needed. Collaborative dialogues can help to map both adaptation opportunities and potential negative impacts. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">There is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure that climate adaptation efforts have positive results and include the concerns of everyone affected. Cities and local communities are diverse, and thus they have diverse perspectives on what responses to prioritise. Moreover, adaptation efforts may impact people’s lives in very different ways. Policy tools, strategies and financial arrangements for adaptation can include all society sectors and address socioeconomic inequalities. Planning and decision making must respond to marginalised voices and future generations (including children and youth).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Efforts to adapt to climate change can be incremental, reformist or transformational, depending on the scale of the change required. Incremental action may address specific climate impacts in a given place, but do not challenge the social and political institutions that prevent people from bouncing back better. Reformist action may address some of the social and institutional drivers of exposure and vulnerability, but without addressing the underlying socioeconomic structures that drive differential forms of exposure. For example, social protection measures may improve people’s capacity to cope with climate impacts, but that improved capacity will depend on maintaining such protection measures. Transformative action involves fundamental changes in political and socioeconomic systems, oriented toward addressing vulnerability drivers (e.g., socioeconomic inequalities, consumption cultures). All forms of adaptation are relevant to deliver resilient futures because of the variability of conditions in which adaptation action is needed.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Local and regional governments play an essential role in delivering planning and institutional action suited to local conditions in cities and settlements. Potential strategies can span multiple sectors and scales, ranging from land use management, building codes, critical infrastructure designs and community development actions, to different legal, financial, participatory decision making and robust monitoring and evaluation arrangements. NGOs or third sector organisations can also play a coordinating role by building dialogues across governments, the private sectors and communities through effective communication and social learning. Local action tends to falter without the support of national governments as they are often facilitators of resources and finance. They can create institutional frameworks that facilitate (rather than impede) local action. National governments also play a crucial role in the development of large-scale infrastructures.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Private actors can also drive adaptation action. The evaluation of private-led infrastructure and housing projects suggests that the prioritisation of profit, however, may have a detrimental impact on the overall resilience of a place. New institutional models such as public–private partnerships respond to the shortcomings of both the public and private sectors. Still, the evidence of them facilitating the inclusion of multiple actors is mixed.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The private sector can mobilise finance. However, the forms of finance available for adaptation are limited and directed to huge projects that do not always address local adaptation needs. Private actors tend to join adaptation projects when there is an expectation of large profits, such as in interventions that increase real estate value. Private-led adaptation can lead to ‘gentrification’ whereby low-income populations are relocated from urban centres and safer settlements. Models that enable the collaboration between public, private and civil society sectors have greater potential to mobilise adaptation finance in inclusive ways.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Forms of collaborative planning and decision making can create dialogues for a sustainable future in cities, settlements and infrastructure systems. Adaptation action needs multiple approaches. For example, adaptation needs both actions that depend on dialogues between multiple actors (e.g., urban planning and zoning) and action that follows strong determination and leadership (e.g., declarations of emergency and target commitments). There are adaptation actions that depend on place-based conditions (e.g., flood defences) and those that require considering interactions across scales (e.g., regulatory frameworks). The growth of adaptation capacities, fostering dialogues, empowered communities, multi-scalar assessments and foresight within current institutions can support effective and inclusive adaptation action that is also sustained in the long term.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="Abatzoglou--2016" lang="en-GB">Abatzoglou, J.T. and A.P.
