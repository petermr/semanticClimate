Rather, it involves expediting the pace of change (speed) while also removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high emissions (quality and depth), and aligning the interests of different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth). One key to enabling deep and broad transitions is integrating the views of different government agencies, businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in transition processes. Another critical driver of deep and broad transitions is engaging and empowering workers, youth, women, the poor, minorities and marginalised stakeholders in just, equitable and inclusive processes.

The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sathaye--2007">Sathaye et al. 2007</a>) added an additional perspective to these interconnections, acknowledging the existence of a two-way relationship between sustainable development and climate change.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Denton--2014">Denton et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fleurbaey--2014">Fleurbaey et al. 2014</a>) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C<span class="•-Condensed-italic"></span> (SR1.5) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al. 2018</a> a) have arguably made the strongest links between climate and sustainable development to date. One of the key messages of AR5 was that the implementation of climate mitigation and adaptation actions could help promote sustainable development, and it emphasised the need for transformational changes in this regard. The AR5 also concluded that the link between climate change and sustainable development is cross-cutting and complex, and that thus the impacts of climate change are threatening the efforts being made to achieve sustainable development. The SR1.5 helped systematise these links by mapping the synergies and trade-offs between selected SDG indicators and climate mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al. 2018</a> b) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of the Results of Studies Where Decarbonisation Transitions are Framed Within the Context of Sustainable Development" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.3">Section 17.3</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Despite the clear links between sustainable development and climate change being recognised from the early stages of the IPCC, climate change has often been portrayed as an environmental problem to be addressed chiefly by environmental ministries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2007">Brown et al. 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Munasinghe--2007">Munasinghe 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Swart--2007">Swart and Raes 2007</a>). However, this perception has evolved over time. It is now increasingly common to see governments and other actors understand the wider ramifications of a changing climate for sustainable development.

As outlined in Chapter 14, the year 2015 was a turning point due to two agreements: (i) the Paris Agreement; and (ii) the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Farzaneh--2021">Farzaneh et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Following a long history of references to sustainable development in the UNFCCC and related agreements, the Paris Agreement helped to strengthen the links between climate and sustainable development by emphasising that sustainability is related to its objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sindico--2016">Sindico 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016">UNFCCC 2016</a>). One of the ways that it helped tighten this link is by institutionalising bottom-up pledges and the review architecture. Toward this end, the Paris Agreement instituted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as vehicles through which countries make pledges and demonstrate their commitment to climate action. Although there was no clear guidance on what should be included in the NDCs, some of the requirements were elaborated in the Paris Rulebook . Some of the submitted NDCs included only mitigation efforts, but others set out mitigation and adaptation goals aligning NDC commitments to national planning processes, while yet others mentioned links with the SDGs.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Another way that the Paris Agreement and the NDCs could strengthen their links to sustainable development is to update country-specific climate pledges. Countries are free to choose their targets and the means and instruments with which to implement them. A core feature of the NDCs was that countries submit NDCs every five years, giving them an opportunity to assess themselves relative to other countries, raise their ambitions and learn from their peers. Moreover, it was emphasised that countries should not ‘backslide’ in subsequent NDCs, thus ensuring that countries should always be forward-looking in respect of increasing their ambitions to deliver the Paris Goals. (<a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6hne--2017">Höhne et al. 2017</a>) found that, in developing countries especially, the NDC preparation process has improved national climate policymaking.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Despite some favourable reviews, several assessments of specific countries’ NDCs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andries--2017">Andries et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2016">Rogelj et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vandyck--2016">Vandyck et al. 2016</a>) have assessed that those submitted for 2020–2030 are insufficient for delivering on the Paris goals. Updated and/or new NDCs were therefore submitted by the end of 2020. However, an assessment of those NDCs revealed that the level of ambition was significantly lower than the goals of the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCO--2020">UNFCCO 2020</a>) (see also this chapter). One of the urgent calls in Paris was to assess the impacts and efforts that need to be undertaken to keep global warming well below 2°C in relation to pre-industrial levels and evaluate related global GHG emission pathways (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2015">UNFCCC 2015</a>). Although the initial NDCs fell short of these goals, the idea was that NDCs would be living documents that could ratchet up climate action and ambition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Countries have also started to take actions on the SDGs themselves (<a class="reference-link" href="#Antwi-Agyei--2018a">Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2016">UNDESA 2016</a>, 2017, 2018). The SDGs were perceived as a novel approach to development and as establishing a universal agenda for the transformation of development patterns and socio-economic systems. At their core, the SDGs hold that building an integrated framework for action necessitates addressing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development in an integrated manner (<a class="reference-link" href="#Biermann--2017">Biermann et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kanie--2017">Kanie and Biermann 2017</a>). The SDGs take multiple elements of development into account in aiming to offer coherent, well-integrated, overarching approaches to a range of sustainability challenges, including climate change.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">One way a link is made between climate and the SDGs is through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). Paralleling the bottom-up orientation of the Paris Agreement and the NDCs, every year approximately forty countries voluntarily share their VNRs with the international community at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). Even more flexible than the NDCs, the VNRs can include content such as a summary of key policies and measures that are intended to achieve the SDGs, a list of the means of implementation that support the SDGs, and related challenges and needs. The VNRs also often cover SDG 13 (climate action) as well as many other issues connected with climate change. Even with these links, implementation of the SDGs should be mentioned as part of national development processes reflecting different countries’ different priorities, visions and plans (Hanson and Korbla P. Puplampu 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Marcotullio--2018">Marcotullio et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2016">OECD 2016</a>; P.

Policy coherence and integration between sectors are two of the most critical factors in breaking down the silo mode of working of different sectors. Working across climate and other sustainability agendas is essential to coherence.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A final way that the sustainability and climate agendas have been linked is through vertical integration. Following a similar trend that appeared with Agenda 21, for which many cities adopted local plans, a growing number of cities have introduced Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). The VLRs resemble the VNRs, but place the emphasis on local actions and needs regarding the SDGs (and some links to climate change) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ort%C3%ADz-Moya--2021">Ortíz-Moya et al. 2021</a>).

Meanwhile, the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, a political movement convened by major country-group representatives and launched in 2010 by the German government, has also called for sustainability to be an intrinsic part of the transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCO--2020">UNFCCO 2020</a>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#BMU--2018">BMU 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Due in part to the shifting orientation of these international processes, there is growing evidence of action on climate change and sustainable development at other levels of decision-making.

In order for this diverse collection of stakeholders to take action, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed from a linear model of knowledge-generation to an interdisciplinary model that co-produces knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2019">Liu et al. 2019</a>). In fact, some have argued that accelerating just transitions for purposes of sustainable development requires the involvement of several actors, institutions and disciplines (<a class="reference-link" href="#Delina--2018">Delina and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2018">Sovacool 2018</a> ).

As suggested in <a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.1">Section 17.1</a>, the reference to ‘in the context of sustainable development’ suggests that sustainable transitions require more than speed, also necessitating removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high emissions (quality and depth of transitions), while also aligning the interests of different individuals, communities, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth of transitions).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The outcome of sustainable transitions is a sustainable transformation. While transitions involve ‘processes that shift development pathways and reorient energy, transport, urban and other subsystems’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Loorbach--2017">Loorbach et al. 2017</a>) (Chapter 16), transformation is the resulting ‘fundamental reorganisation of large-scale socio-economic systems’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6lscher--2018">Hölscher et al. 2018</a>)<span class="•-Condensed-italic">. </span> Such a fundamental reorganisation often requires dynamic multi-stage transition processes that change everything from public policies and prevailing technologies to individual lifestyles, and social norms to governance arrangements and institutions of political economy. This set of factors can lock-in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering the momentum needed for transformations. <a class="section-link" data-title="Innovation, technology development and transfer" href="/chapters/chapter-16">Chapter 16</a> provides an overview of the multi-stage transition dynamics involved in moving from experimentation to commercialisation to integration to stabilisation. That overview describes how transitions can break through lock-ins and result in a transformation.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While there may be a relatively consistent set of transition dynamics for all countries, pathways are likely to vary across and even within countries. This variation is due to different development levels, starting points, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and other contextual factors. Given the diversity of contributing factors, a sustainable transition is likely to be a complex and multi-faceted process which cannot be reduced to a single dimension (<a class="reference-link" href="#K%C3%B6hler--2019">Köhler et al. 2019</a>). Even with this multi-dimensionality, transition processes are likely to gain speed and become more sustainable as decision-makers adopt targeted policies and other interventions. Many disciplines have reflected on the roles of and relative influence on the policies and interventions that can drive transitions. The following discussion describes this diversity of views with a survey of how prominent lines of economic, psychological, institutional and systems thinking explain transitions. Though these disciplines differ greatly, they often stress that leveraging synergies and managing trade-offs between climate change and sustainable development can help advance a transition.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="17.2.1"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.2.1</span>Economics <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-4-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section concentrates on economic explanations for transitions. At the core of many of these explanations is the assumption that economic development can deliver multiple economic, social and environmental benefits. Many modern economic systems may nonetheless struggle to deliver these benefits due to major disruptions and shocks such as climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Heal--2020">Heal 2020</a>). One way to limit disruptions to free markets are targeted interventions in free markets such as taxes or regulation. These targeted interventions motivate firms and other entities to internalise GHGs and other pollutants, potentially paving the way for a sustainable transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arrow--2004">Arrow et al. 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chichilnisky--1998">Chichilnisky and Heal 1998</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A related line of thought common to economic explanations involves the principles of ‘weak sustainability’. These principles suggest that the substitution of exhaustible resources is, to some extent, feasible (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arrow--2004">Arrow et al. 2004</a>). One way to capitalise on this substitution is to target investments at technological change, green growth, and research and development. Targeted investments in the form of subsidies can encourage the substitution of exhaustible by non-exhaustible resources. To illustrate with a concrete example, investments in renewable energy can not only mitigate climate change but also offset the use of exhaustible fossil fuels and boost energy security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Heal--2020">Heal 2020</a>). It is nonetheless important to note that the principle of ‘weak sustainability’ contrasts with ‘strong sustainability’ or ‘integrated sustainability’ principles. These stronger principles suggest that constraints on resources restrict such substitutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rockstr%C3%B6m--2009">Rockström et al. 2009</a>). These constraints merit attention because some scarce non-substitutable forms of natural capital can be exhausted (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bateman--2020">Bateman and Mace 2020</a>). There is hence a need to capitalise on possible synergies such as those with other development priorities and trade-offs, for example, the exhaustion of non-substitutable resources. Capturing these synergies and managing these trade-offs is consistent with sustainable development, a state where the needs of the present generation do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (Bruntland, <a class="reference-link" href="#WCED--1987">WCED 1987</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As suggested above, aligning climate investments with other sustainable development objectives is critical to a transition. In order to support better investments in sustainable development, financing schemes, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure schemes and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), can play important roles (Executive Summary in <a class="section-link" data-title="Investment and finance" href="/chapters/chapter-15">Chapter 15</a> of this report). After COVID-19, economic recovery packages have increased government-led investments (<a class="section-link" data-title="Some Other Key Trends and Developments" href="/chapters/chapter-1#1.3.3">Section 1.3.3</a>), which could potentially be aligned with sustainable development. Technological change and innovation are considered key drivers of economic growth and of many aspects of social progress (<a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.1">Section 16.1</a>), but if technological innovation policies are coordinated with the shift to sustainable development pathways, then the economic benefits of technological change could come at the cost of increasing climate risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gossart--2015">Gossart 2015</a>) <a class="reference-link" href="#Alarc%C3%B3n--2015">Alarcón and Vos 2015</a>). The environmental impacts of social and economic activities, including emissions of GHGs, are greatly influenced by the rate and direction of technological changes. Innovation and technological transformations present trade-offs that create externalities and rebound effects. This suggests that a sustainable future for people and nature requires rapid, radical and transformative societal change by integrating the technical, governance, financial and societal aspects (<a class="reference-link" href="#P%C3%B6rtner--2021">Pörtner et al. 2021</a>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction" href="/chapters/chapter-16#16.1">Section 16.1</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">One area that is pertinent to transitions and has received considerable attention in economic modelling involving climate change is innovation. In particular, some studies have shown how low-cost innovations and improvements in end-use technologies have significant potential for emissions reductions as well as sustainable development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2019">Wilson et al. 2019</a>). Currently information technologies are improving rapidly, and the internet of things (IoT), AI and Big Data can all contribute to other development needs. This is often the case in end-use sectors, as the benefits accrue directly to the individuals who use the new innovations. The achievement and widespread deployment of fully autonomous cars, for example, will bring about broader car- and ride-sharing with negative or low additional costs compared to more conventional approaches to car ownership, with their typically very low load factors. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grubler--2018">Grubler et al. 2018</a>) estimate that the Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario which assumes information technology innovations and induced social changes, including a sharing economy, have considerable potential for harmonising the multiple achievements of SDGs with low marginal abatement costs compared with other scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">It is nonetheless important to highlight a caveat to the above logic on innovation. Whether a technological innovation is wholly sustainable or not becomes less clear when considering its effects on the wider economy. To illustrate, some models predict that CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> marginal abatement costs in the power sector will be USD240 and USD565 tCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> for the 2ºC and below 2ºC goals, respectively (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2017">IEA 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In theory, if marginal abatement costs meet marginal climate damage, mitigation measures are economically optimal in the long run. Yet marginal damage from climate change is notoriously uncertain, and economic theories do not always reflect climate-related damage. On the other hand, marginal abatement mitigation costs impose additional costs in the short term. These added costs can cause productivity in capital to decline through increases in the prices of energy and products in which the energies are embodied. These increased costs can restrict the ability to invest in and achieve the sustainable development priorities. However, precisely the opposite can occur when innovation reduces additional costs or achieves negative costs. If technological innovation leads to the accumulation of capital and productivity increases due to the substitution of energy, material and labour, these are likely to deliver sustainable development and climate mitigation benefits.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="17.2.2"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.2.2</span> Institutions, Governance and Political Economy <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-5-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This subsection focuses on institutions, governance and the political economy.

An inner transition within an individual (see e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Parodi--2018">Parodi and Tamm 2018</a>) typically involves a person gaining a deepening sense of peace and a willingness to help others, as well as protecting the climate and the planet (see e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Banks--2007">Banks 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Power--2016">Power 2016</a>).

Others assess how institutional arrangements can be reformed in order to align climate with the sustainable development agenda to enable a transition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While there are indeed significant differences between explanations, there are also important parallels. Such parallels begin with a shared emphasis on synergies and trade-offs between climate and sustainable development. Most explanations tend to underline the importance of synergies in aligning the climate with broader sustainability agendas. Most importantly, many of the explanations are complementary with the systems-level discussion in that they offer a broad framework, while economic, psychological and governance theories offer more specific insights. Moving a transition forward will often require drawing upon insights from multiple schools of thought. Though it is unlikely that a one-size-fits-all set of factors will drive a transition, there is a growing body of empirical evidence shedding light on the factors that can strengthen synergies between climate and the broader sustainable development agenda.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="17.3"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.3</span>Assessment of the Results of Studies Where Decarbonisation Transitions are Framed Within the Context of Sustainable Development </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-4-siblings"></div><div class="h2-container" id="17.3.1"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2-–-number-under-H1" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.3.1</span>Introduction <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-9-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section assesses studies based on the links between sustainable development and climate change mitigation in order to facilitate robust conclusions on synergies and trade-offs between different policy objectives across methodologies, scenarios and sectors.

It is also being realised that, under the Paris Agreement, climate change policies should be integrated into sustainable development agendas, while the UN 2030 Agenda as well includes SDG 13 on climate actions. In this way, both UN agreements provide joint opportunities for systematic transitions in support of both climate change and sustainable development. Achievement of the Paris Agreement’s goals will require a rapid and deep worldwide transition in all GHG emissions sectors, including land use, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities, as well as in consumption and behaviour (UNEP 2019). Meeting the goals of such a transformation requires that the long-term targets and pathways to fulfil the stabilisation scenarios play an important role in guiding the direction and pathways of short-term transitions. There is therefore a need for long- and short-term policies and investment decisions to be closely coordinated.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In the context of the Paris Agreement, countries have submitted their initial plans for the decarbonisation of their economies to the UNFCCC in the form of their so-called National Determined Contributions (NDCs). The ambitions of the NDCs are closely related to the ongoing UNFCCC negotiations over the financial measures and forms of compensation. Although the Paris Agreement emphasises the links between climate policies and sustainable development, the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs are not very well represented at present in the NDCs, according to <a class="reference-link" href="#Fuso%20Nerini--2019">Fuso Nerini et al. (2019)</a>. Very few of the NDCs include any reference to the SDGs, which (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fuso%20Nerini--2019">Fuso Nerini et al. 2019</a>) highlight as a barrier to the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement, which induces them to call for a more holistic policy approach. <a class="reference-link" href="#Campagnolo--2019">Campagnolo and Davide (2019)</a> have assessed the impacts of the submitted NDCs on poverty eradication and inequalities of income based on empirical research and a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. One conclusion is that the NDCs of less developed countries would tend to reduce poverty alleviation, but this can be offset if international financial support is provided for the mitigation actions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The alignment of climate-policy targets in the NDCs with sustainable development has been assessed by means of integrated assessment models (IAMs), macroeconomic and sectoral modelling. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Iyer--2018">Iyer et al. 2018</a>) based on IAM-based studies, the implications of framing NDCs being placed more narrowly on mitigation targets rather than on a framing in which the impacts on sustainable development were explicitly taken into consideration. It was thus concluded that some SDGs would be directly supported as a side benefit of the climate policy targets included in the NDCs, while other SDGs needed a special policy design going beyond narrow climate policy objectives. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Iyer--2018">Iyer et al. 2018</a>) also assessed the regional distribution of efforts in terms of domestic mitigation costs and SDG impacts and concluded that the geographical distribution of mitigation costs and SDG benefits were not similar, so a special effort would be needed to match climate policies and policies to meet the SDGs. Accordingly, a national decision-making perspective suggests that SDGs should be integrated into national climate policies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The NDCs submitted to the Paris Agreement have demonstrated a lack of progress in meeting the long-term temperature goals. In the context of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN Sustainable Development Report 2019 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sachs--2019">Sachs et al. 2019</a>) also concluded that there is a particular lack of progress in achieving SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). Given the close link between the SDGs and climate change policies, the current obstacles in meeting the former could also be a barrier to realising transitions to low-carbon societies. Conversely, opportunities to leverage the SDGs could in many cases involve climate actions, since policies enabling climate adaptation and mitigation could also support food and energy security and water conservation if they were well designed (see the detailed discussion in the section on synergies and trade-offs between climate policies and meeting the SDGs in <a class="section-link" data-title="Cross-sectoral Overview of Synergies and Trade-offs Between Climate Change Mitigation and the SDGs" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.3.3.7">Section 17.3.3.7</a>, Chapter 3, and <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>).These findings point to a specific need to align economic and social development perspectives, climate change and natural systems. While all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and over time. These priorities are strongly linked to local contexts and depend on which dimension of the improvement in the well-being of people is considered to be the most urgent. Eradicating poverty and reducing inequality are key development priorities for many low- and middle-income countries (<a class="section-link" data-title="Countries Have Different Development Priorities" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3.2.1">Section 4.3.2.1</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A key barrier to the development of national plans and policies to meet the UN 2030 SDGs is the lack of finance. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sachs--2019">Sachs et al. 2019</a>) conclude that meeting the SDGs to achieve social transformations worldwide would require 2–3% of global GDP and that it would be a huge challenge to ensure that finance is targeted to the world’s poorest countries and people. The UN Secretary-General has called for the allocation of finance to meet the UN’s 2030 Agenda with a strong emphasis on the private sector, but to date no governance frameworks or associated financial modalities have been established in the UN or the UNFCCC context for the formal alignment of sustainable development and transitions to take place in accordance with the low global temperature-stabilisation targets in the Paris Agreement. Accelerating investments, particularly in low-income countries, will be required to meet both the Paris goals and the SDGs (<a class="section-link" data-title="Development of Local Capital Markets" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.7">Section 15.6.7</a>). The mismatch between capital and investment needs, home-bias considerations and differences in risk perceptions between rich and poor represent major challenges for private finance. Green bond markets and markets for sustainable financal products have increased significantly, and the landscape has continued to evolve since AR5 (Executive Summary in Chapter 15). Special efforts and activities are particularly required for raising finance in developing countries.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Based on the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC has invited countries to communicate their mid-century and long-term low-GHG emission-development strategies by 2020 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2019">UNFCCC 2019</a>). National long-term low-emission development strategies and their global stocktake in the UNFCCC context provide a platform for informing the long-term strategic thinking on transitions towards low-carbon societies. One specific value of these plans is that they reflect how specific transition pathways, policies and measures can work in different parts of the world in a very context-specific way, that is, by taking context-specific issues and stakeholder perspectives into consideration. Many nations have submitted national long-term strategies to the UNFCCC, including sustainable development perspectives (see Section 4.2.4 for a review of the plans and scientific assessments).</p><div class="h3-container" id="17.3.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.3.2.1</span>Model Assessments on the Sustainable Development Pathways for Decarbonisation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-1-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section assesses the model evaluations of the sustainable development pathways for decarbonisation, including the co-benefits and trade-offs involving explorations of alternative future development pathways as a basis for clarifying societal objectives and understanding the restrictions.

For a more detailed discussion about this, see <a class="section-link" data-title href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Development pathways that focus narrowly on climate mitigation or economic growth will not lead to the SDGs and long-term climate-stabilisation objectives being achieved.

Areas of focal modelling include green investments, technological change, employment generation and the performance of policy instruments, such as green taxes, subsidies, emission permits, investments and finance. Short- and long-term macroeconomic models have been used to assess the impacts of such policy instruments. <a class="reference-link" href="#Jaumotte--2021">Jaumotte et al.

This may imply the co-creation of benefits between climate policy objectives, and macroeconomic policy goals such as employment creation.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There is an emerging modelling literature focusing on the synergies and trade-offs between low-carbon development pathways and various aspects of sustainable development. The early literature, including that on IAMs, and macroeconomic and sectoral models, mainly focused on the co-benefits of mitigation policies in terms of reduced air pollution, energy security and to some extent employment generation security (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014">IPCC 2014</a>, 2018c) (Chapter 6). Some models have been developed further with assessments of a broader range of the joint benefits of mitigation, health, water, land use and food security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clarke--2014">Clarke et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014">IPCC 2014</a>, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kolstad--2014">Kolstad et al. 2014</a>). According to Chapter 1, there is a need to incorporate issues and enablers further, including a wide range of non-climate risks, varying forms of innovation, possibilities for behavioural and social change, feasible policies and equity issues (Executive Summary in Chapter 1).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">IAMs and macroeconomic models typically calculate mitigation costs based on the assumption that markets internalise externalities like GHG emissions through carbon prices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barker--2016">Barker et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2017">IEA 2017</a>, 2019). Yet, there are legitimate questions to be asked about whether carbon pricing will be efficient if markets are inefficient (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2019">World Bank 2019</a>). However, market inefficiencies are difficult to integrate into the models. How GHG emissions taxes would actually work is thus quite uncertain based on the modelling studies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barker--2016">Barker et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fontana--2016">Fontana and Sawyer 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Meyer--2018">Meyer et al. 2018</a>). Despite these limitations, the use of GHG emission taxes as an effective instrument based on modelling results in practice has implications for public policies and private-sector investments.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Despite the shortcomings of conventional economic thought and models already pointed out, improved models have demonstrated new perspectives on how mitigation costs can be assessed in macroeconomic models. For instance, while a conventional perspective might suggest that climate change mitigation costs can limit investments in sustainability because they reduce the productivity of capital by increasing energy prices and the products in which energies are embodied, another perspective is that innovation can imply increases in efficiency and that the substitution of energy, material and labour can lead to the accumulation of capital and productivity gains. This appears to occur with innovations in end-use energy applications generating emissions reductions and delivering on other sustainable development benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2019">Wilson et al. 2019</a>). Similarly, IAM models have been applied to model the potential for Low Energy Demand (LED) scenarios associated with demand-side innovations in the service sector. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grubler--2018">Grubler et al. 2018</a>) have developed a climate-friendly LED scenario which assumes information technology innovations such as the internet of things (IoT) and induced social changes such as the sharing economy. Nonetheless there are still very important limits on the degree to which highly aggregated IAM models and macroeconomic models can integrate ethics, equity and several other key policy-relevant aspects of sustainable development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Easterlin--2010">Easterlin et al. 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Koch--2020">Koch 2020</a>). A key limitation in this context is that, while all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and over time. Moreover, these priorities are strongly linked to local contexts, and this can only be reflected directly in national models (<a class="section-link" data-title="Implications of Development Pathways for Mitigation and Mitigative Capacity" href="/chapters/chapter-4#4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">An example of a project that assesses the economy-wide impacts of linking sustainable development with deep decarbonisation is the Deep Decarbonisation Pathways Project (DDPP) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bataille--2016">Bataille et al. 2016</a>), which is undertaking a comparative assessment of studies of 16 countries representing more than 74% of global energy-related emissions for the pathway to 2ºC stabilisation scenarios. The DDPP’s methodology is to combine scenario analysis in different national contexts using macroeconomic models and sectoral models and to facilitate a consistent cross-country analysis using a set of common assumptions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The key conclusions of the DDPP team on the economy-wide impacts are that country-based studies such as South Africa’s demonstrate that it is possible to improve income distribution, alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment while simultaneously transitioning to a low-carbon economy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Altieri--2016">Altieri et al. 2016</a>). The DDPP in Japan explores whether energy security can be enhanced through increases in renewable energy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oshiro--2016">Oshiro et al. 2016</a>). The reduction of uncontrolled fossil fuel emissions has significant public-health benefits according to the Chinese and Indian DDPPs, as fossil fuel combustion is the major source of air pollution.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">For example, in the Chinese DDPP, deep decarboniation scenarios have resulted in reductions of 42–79% in primary air pollutants (e.g., SO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, NO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">x</span>, particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and NH<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>), thus meeting air-quality standards in major cities. The deep decarbonisation scenarios include the large and fast energy-efficient improvements required to improve energy access and affordability. The DDPP studies are thus an example of an approach in which national deep-carbonisation scenarios are linked to the development goals of income generation, energy access and affordability, employment, health and environmental policy.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Sustainable development scenarios have also been developed by the Low-Carbon Society’s (LCS) assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kainuma--2012">Kainuma et al. 2012</a>), in which multiple sustainable development and climate change mitigation goals were assessed jointly. The scenario analysis was conducted for Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, India, China and Nepal with a soft linked IAM using economy-wide and sectoral models and linked to very active stakeholder engagement in order to reflect national policy perspectives and priorities. Some of the models are economy-wide global IAMs, while others are national partial equilibrium models.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The LCS scenarios also include a specific attempt to include ongoing dialogues with policymakers and stakeholders in order to reflect governance and enabling factors, and to enable the modelling processes to reflect political realism as far as possible. Diverse stakeholders who acted as validators of the scientific process were included, stakeholder preferences were revealed, and recipients and users of the LCS outputs were included in ongoing dialogues on outputs and in interpreting the results. The aim of the stakeholder interactions was thus to fill the gap between typical laboratory-style IAMs and down-scaled but unaligned practical assessments performed at disaggregated geographical and sector-specific scales.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Energy scenarios for sustainable development were included in The World Energy Outlook of the IEA (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2019">IEA 2019</a>, 2020) in terms of a Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which assessed not only SDG 13 (climate action) but also SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 3.9 (air pollution). This scenario takes as its starting point the policy goal of meeting these SDGs and then assesses the costs of meeting an emissions reduction target of 70% of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> from the energy system by 2030. The scenario concludes that retrofitting coal-fired power plants with pollution controls is the cheapest option for dealing with local pollution in the short term, but that this is not consistent with meeting the long-term emissions goals of the Paris Agreement. The SDS scenario combines the goal of reducing the amount of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> in the energy system by 70%, with large decreases in energy-related emissions of NO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">X</span>, SO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> and PM<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2.5</span>, leading to a fall of 40–60% by 2030, and to 2.5 million fewer premature deaths from air pollution in 2030 than in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which represent a continuation of current trends in the energy system (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020">IEA 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The costs of energy-system transitions have been assessed by several energy-system studies.

Studies using global IAMs that were presented in the GEO6 report (<a class="reference-link" href="#United%20Nations%20Environment%20Programme--2019">United Nations Environment Programme 2019</a>, Chapter 22) concluded that transitions to low-carbon pathways will require a broad portfolio of measures, including a mixture of technological improvements, lifestyle changes and localised solutions. The many different challenges require dedicated measures to improve access to, for example, food, water and energy, while at the same time reducing the pressure on environmental resources and ecosystems. A key contribution may be a redistribution of access to resources, where both physical access and affordability play a role. The IAMs cover large countries and regions, and localised solutions are not properly addressed in the modelling results.

The studies find significant impacts of mitigation policies at the sectoral level, reflecting the fact that the sectoral scope does not allow for as much flexibility in mitigation measures despite macroeconomic impacts being assessed to be small (Executive Summary in Chapter 4). Another key lesson is that the detailed design of mitigation policies is critical for the distributional impacts (Executive Summary in Chapter 4). The potential mitigation measures, the potential economic growth, the political priorities and so forth are different among nations, and there may be several emissions-reduction transition pathways to long-term goals among nations (Figure 4.2).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="17.3.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_•-H3-–-numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.3.2.2</span>Renewable Energy Penetration and Fossil Fuel Phase-o ut <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-2-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As pointed out in Chapter 6, the achievement of long-term temperature goals in line with the Paris Agreement requires the rapid penetration of renewable energy and a timely phasing out of fossil fuels, especially coal, from the global energy system.

Net zero emissions imply that fossil fuel use is minimised and replaced by renewables and other low-carbon primary forms of energy, or that the residual emissions from fossil fuels are offset by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The 1.5°C scenario requires a 2–3% annual improvement rate in carbon intensities till 2050.

Some locally negative economic impacts can result in increased energy costs and competition over land areas and water resources. Some sectors may also experience increasing unemployment as a consequence of the transition process.

Over the past twenty years, Asia has accounted for 90% of all coal-fired capacity built worldwide, and these plants have potentially long operational lifetimes ahead of them. In developing economies in Asia, existing coal-fired plants are just twelve years old on average. There are three options for bringing down emissions from the existing stock of plants: to retrofit them with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or biomass co-firing equipment; to repurpose them to focus on providing system adequacy and flexibility while reducing operations; and to retire them early.

A less diversified local economy, low labour mobility and heavy dependence on coal revenues will make closing down coal production particularly challenging from a political economy perspective. Policy is needed to support and invest in impacted areas to smooth the transition, absorb the impact and incentivise new opportunities. A supportive policy for the transition could include both short-term support and long-term investment. Short-term compensation could be helpful for local workers, communities, companies and governments to manage the consequences of coal closures. Earlier involvement with local stakeholders using a structured approach is crucial and will make the transition policy more targeted and better administered. The long-term policy should target support to the local economy and workers to move beyond coal, including a strategic plan to transform the impacted area, investment in local infrastructure and education, and preference policies to incentivise emerging businesses. Most importantly, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ex ante</span> policy implementation is far better than <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ex post </span> compensation.

Political and economic considerations, at least regionally, are also of great importance in the coal sector due to the approximately 35,000 people employed within it (including coal mining and the power stations themselves). For a long time, coal-fired power plants were able to protect their position in Germany, but against the background of decreasing public acceptance, economic problems resulting from the growing use of renewables and ambitious GHG reduction targets, the sector cannot resist the political pressure against it any longer. The governing parties have agreed to establish a commission called ‘Growth, structural change and employment’ to develop a strategy for phasing out coal-fired power plants (<a class="reference-link" href="#E3G%20Annual%20Review--2018">E3G Annual Review 2018</a>).

Stranded assets become devalued before the end of their economic life or can no longer be monetised due to changes in policies and regulatory frameworks, technological change, security, or environmental disruption.

Divestment refers to ‘the action or process of selling off subsidiary business interests or investments’. This often occurs due to changing social norms and perceptions of climate change.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Indeed, pressure is mounting on fossil fuel industries to remove their capital from heavy carbon industries. As the former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, remarked, a wholesale reassessment of prospects, especially if it were to occur suddenly, could potentially destabilise markets, sparking a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and a persistent tightening of financial conditions. In other words, an abrupt resolution to the tragedy of horizons itself poses a risk to financial stability (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2015">OECD 2015</a>). The divestment narrative is also based on the view that a shift away from intensive carbon resources will be significant, as the ‘less value will be destroyed, […] the more can be re-invested in low carbon infrastructure’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2015">OECD 2015</a>). Social movements are critical to triggering rapid transformational change and moving away from dangerous levels of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mckibben--2012">Mckibben 2012</a>). Although divestment is hailed as a necessary action to decouple fossil fuel from growth and force carbon-intensive industries to go out of business, there is the sense that there is no shortage of investors who are willing to buy shares, so that such resources are not stranded, but simply relocated. Criticism has been levelled at the divestment movement for not having a significant impact on funding fossil fuels and not being sufficiently in tune with other wide-ranging complexities that go beyond the moral dimensions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bergman--2018">Bergman 2018</a>).

This logic means that developing countries that rely on fossil fuel extraction will need to replace their hydrocarbon revenues with other income-generating activities.

The goal of staying within the 1.5°C temperature goal, in line with the Paris Agreement, is already part of the policy vision and planning of large fossil fuel-consuming economies.

There are parallel movements that can be observed. On the one hand, divestment initiatives are underway to move away from carbon-intensive investments. On the other hand, hydrocarbon-rich countries in some parts of the developing world are identifying new opportunities to reduce the fiscal loss associated with the loss of fossil fuel revenues.

The concept has come under increased scrutiny, with its protagonists emphasising the need to focus on the equality of the transition, not simply on its speed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Forsyth--2014">Forsyth 2014</a>).

This link with stranded assets is important, but it may be overlooked, as countries whose assets are becoming stranded may not have the relevant resources, knowledge, autonomy or agency to design a fresh orientation or decide on the transition. In addition, some developing countries are dependent not only on fossil fuel revenues, but also on foreign exchange earnings from exports. This dependence comes into sharp focus when one considers that 30% of the Malaysian government’s revenues are linked to petroleum products, and that Mozambique, by exploiting its newly discovered natural-gas reserves, can earn seven times the country’s current GDP over a period of 25 years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cronin--2021">Cronin et al. 2021</a>).

Climate change impacts will disable the food, water and energy systems of the most vulnerable. Therefore, the resources required to enable a just transition are predicated on good leadership and governance institutions that will support quality and justice-based transitions. Beyond energy systems, changes to land systems can benefit from sustainable land management in ways that will reduce the pressure on land for food and at the same time support carbon storage. With land coming under increased pressure, land and forest management are critical for carbon sequestration, as well as other ecosystem benefits. Extractive processes have impacts on land, and often there are few if any redistributive benefits for communities in regions where extraction takes place. In addition, extraction of strategic minerals such as cobalt, copper and lithium have been linked to violence, human rights abuses and conflict (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cronin--2021">Cronin et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, in the race to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, some of the other priorities of the transition, like climate change adaptation and its inherent vulnerabilities, might become muted, given the urgency to mitigate at all costs. Consequently, the transition imperative reduces the scope for local priority-setting and ignores the additional risks faced by countries with the least capacity to adapt. Equally, the ‘just transition’ is often seen through the prism of job losses and the attendant retooling and reskilling imperatives necessary to re-dynamise local businesses, especially those that may fail as a result of mine closures. It is equally important to consider current disparities in knowledge and capacity which could maintain the existing inequalities in the global regional distribution of costs and benefits. One striking example is the manufacturing of PV in India when compared to manufacturing PV in China. In China, manufacturing costs are lower than in India, as are import tariffs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Behuria--2020">Behuria 2020</a>). Similarly, a solar industry might have greater development prospects in one region than another given existing regional disparities in human capital, infrastructure, finance and technological development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cronin--2021">Cronin et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Low-carbon transitions and equality implications will depend on local contexts, regional priorities, the points of departure of different countries in the transition and the speed at which they will want to travel. Hence, timing and scope are important elements that are associated more with a quality transition than a race to the bottom. To date, the debate has had some obvious blind spots, not least considerations of power, politics and political economy (Denton et al. 2021). Certainly, the transition will create winners and losers, as well as stakeholders that can frame their economic interests so as to determine the orientation, pace, timing and scope of the transition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The determination of a just transition is complex and not simply dependent on the allocation of perceived risks or solutions, but rather on how risks and solutions are defined (<a class="reference-link" href="#Forsyth--2014">Forsyth 2014</a>). Acting urgently to achieve environmental solutions or meet transition imperatives has certain risks given the need to go beyond commonplace definitions of the just transition by emphasising the distributive or procedural aspects. The framing of policies to align with fast and low-cost mitigation without paying sufficient attention to social and economic resilience creates its own potential risks and can enhance social vulnerability rather than address it. The need to distribute climate change solutions must not delegitimise appropriate economic growth strategies, nor indeed create the additional risks of policy imposition. Perceptions of justice with regard to environmental problems and solutions matter equally. Hence, the types of transition pathway that are chosen may have equality implications. Mitigation at all costs, if done ‘cheaply and crudely’, can create additional problems for social justice and inclusive development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Forsyth--2014">Forsyth 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The assumption that the benefits of mitigation are enough to offset trade-offs with other policy objectives can be questioned. If one accepts the argument that not all adaptation addresses vulnerability concerns (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kjell%C3%A9n--2006">Kjellén 2006</a>), and that some adaptation strategies can heighten vulnerabilities if there are flaws in their design and implementation, then the same logic applies, namely that not all mitigation is necessarily beneficial. Hence the emphasis on the transition resulting from mitigation should be placed not only on speed or cost-effectiveness, but also on the legitimacy of the actions, and whether the transition is well designed or not. In short, justice is not always a shorthand for acting ethically, but rather a point of reasoning on what is considered legitimate. Planning for the transition often discounts human rights and social inclusivity that can occur as the result of a rapid transition. The emphasis should be placed on the management of the transition rather than the speed – for instance, if in the rush to build new hydropower energy sources implies that populations are displaced, then this constitutes a human rights violation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Castro--2016">Castro et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Piggot--2019">Piggot et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Ambitious climate goals can increase the urgency of mitigation and accelerate the speed at which carbon neutrality is achieved.

Lifestyle changes, including dietary changes and reduced food waste, are tightly embedded in modes of behaviour that are influenced by the immediate environment (e.g., household, farm), the indirect environment (e.g., community) and macro-environmental factors (e.g., political, financial and economic contexts).

Altogether this implies that any assessment of the contribution of digitalisation to support the SDGs and low-carbon pathways will only be able to provide very context-specific results. Digital technologies could potentially disrupt production processes in nearly every sector of the economy.

It found that efficiency improvements, reduced resource consumption and new services can support the SDGs, but also that there were challenges, including in relation to equality, facing the least-developed and developing countries because of their low level of access to technologies. The necessary preconditions for successful digital transformation include prosperity, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, protection of jobs and good governance of sustainability transitions. One negative impact of digitalisation could be the rebound effects, where easier access to services could increase demand and with it GHG emissions. Digitalisation in the manufacturing sector could also provide a comparative advantage to developed countries due to the falling importance of labour costs, while the barriers to emerging economies seeking to enter global markets could accordingly be increased.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In respect of governance, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Krishnan--2020">Krishnan et al. 2020</a>) point out that the creation of synergies between sustainable development and low-emission urbanisation based on digitalisation could face barriers in the form of inadequate knowledge of structures and value creation through ecosystems that would need to be addressed by means of smart digitalising, requiring organisational measures to support transformation processes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Urban areas are one of the main arenas for new digital solutions due to rapid urbanisation rates and high concentrations of settlements, businesses and supply systems, which offer great potential for large-scale digital systems. The emergence of smart cities has supported the uptake of smart integrated energy, transportation, water and waste-management systems, while synergies have been created in terms of more flexible and efficient systems. In its 2018 Policy and Action document, the Japanese Business Federation (Keidanren) launched Society 5.0, which includes plans for smart-city development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carraz--2019">Carraz and Yuko 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Narvaez%20Rojas--2021">Narvaez Rojas et al. 2021</a>). To achieve smart cities, Society 5.0 aimed to facilitate diverse lifestyles and business success, while the quality of life offered by these options will be enhanced. It also aims to offer high-standard medical and educational services. Autonomous vehicles will be available and integrated with smart-grid systems in order to facilitate mobility and flexibility in energy supply with a high share of renewable energy.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><a class="section-link" data-title="Energy systems" href="/chapters/chapter-6">Chapter 6</a> of this report on ‘Energy Systems’ points out that there are many smart-energy options with the potential to support sustainable development by facilitating the integration of high shares of fluctuating renewable energy in electricity systems, potentially storing energy in electric vehicle (EV) batteries or fuel cells, and applying load shifting by varying prices over time. It is concluded that very large efficiency gains are expected to emerge from digitalisation in the energy sector (Figure 6.18).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><a class="section-link" data-title="Rebound Effects" href="/chapters/chapter-9#9.9.2">Section 9.9.2</a> in <a class="section-link" data-title="Buildings" href="/chapters/chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> concludes that the improved energy efficiency and falling costs in the building sector that could result from digitalisation could have rebound effects in increasing both energy consumption and comfort levels. Increasing GHG emissions could be the result, but if low-income consumers are given faster access to affordable energy, this could agree with the SDGs, making it desirable to integrate policies targeting mitigation.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><a class="section-link" data-title="Trends, Drivers and the Critical Role of Transport in GHG Growth" href="/chapters/chapter-10#10.1.2">Section 10.1.2</a> in <a class="section-link" data-title="Transport" href="/chapters/chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> discusses how the sharing economy, which, for example, could be facilitated by ICT platforms, could influence both mitigation and the SDGs. On the one hand, sharing has the potential to save transport emissions, especially if EVs are supplied with decarbonised grid electricity. However, an increase in transport emissions could result from this if increasing demand and higher comfort levels are facilitated, for example, by making access to EVs relatively easy compared with mass transit. Another possible trade-off is that the supply of public transport services would be limited to the elderly and other user groups.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Green innovation in agriculture is another emerging area in which digitalisation is making huge progress. From the perspective of water provision, weather data can be used to predict rain amounts so that farmers can better manage the application of farm chemicals to minimise polluting aquifers and surface-water systems used for drinking water. Meanwhile, smart meters, on-site and remote sensors and satellite data connected to mobile devices allow real-time monitoring of crop-water and optimal irrigation requirements. On the supply side, remote tele-control systems and efficient irrigation technologies enable farmers to control and optimise the quantity and timing of water applications, while minimising the energy-consumption trade-offs of pressurised irrigation in both rural and urban agricultural contexts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Germer--2011">Germer et al. 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ruiz-Garcia--2009">Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2009</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Technology-driven precision agriculture, which combines geomorphology, satellite imagery, global positioning and smart sensors, enables enormous increases in efficiency and productivity. Taken together, these technologies provide farmers with a decision-support system in real time for the whole farm. Arguably, the world could feed the projected rise in population without radical changes to current agricultural practices if food waste can be minimised or eliminated. Digital technologies will contribute to minimising these losses through increased efficiencies in supply chains, better shipping and transit systems, and improved refrigeration.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In conclusion, in most cases digitalisation options may have both positive synergistic impacts on mitigation and the SDGs and some negative trade-offs. Energy-sector options are assessed primarily as having synergies, while some digitalisation options in transport could increase the demand for emission-intensive modes of transport. Digital platforms for the sharing economy could have both positive and negative impacts depending on the goods and services that are actually exchanged (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7). Options related to agriculture and the water-energy-food nexus (WEFN) could help manage resources more efficiently across sectors, which could create synergies. Digitalisation can also raise a number of ethical challenges according to (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clark--2019">Clark et al. 2019</a>).

The general overview provided in the figure is supplemented by specific sector-by-sector comments on how the synergies and trade-offs mapped depend on the scale of implementation and the overall development context of places where the mitigation options are implemented. For some mitigation options these scaling and context-specific issues imply that there can be both synergies and trade-offs in relation to specific SDGs. In addition to the information provided in Figure 17.1, Supplementary Material Table 17.SM.1 includes the detailed background material provided by the sectoral chapters in terms of qualitative information for each of the synergies and trade-offs mapped.</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer005"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="figure-17-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_17_1.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 17.1 | Trade-offs and synergies between sectoral mitigation options and the Sustainable Developmen</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">t Goals (SDGs). </span></span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The assessment of synergies and trade-offs presented in Figure 17.1 depends on the underlying literature assessed by the sectoral chapters. In cases where no information about the links between specific mitigation options and SDGs are indicated, this does not imply that there are no links, but rather that the links have not been assessed by the literature.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Most of the energy-sector options are assessed as having synergies with several SDGs, but there could be mixed synergies and trade-offs between SDG 2 (zero hunger) for wind and solar energy, and for hydropower due to land-use conflicts and fishery damage. Offshore wind could also have both synergies and trade-offs with SDG 14 (life below water) dependent on scale and implementation site, and it is emphasised that land-use should be coordinated with biodiversity concerns. Both wind and solar energy are assessed as having trade-offs with SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption) due to significant material consumption and disposal needs.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Geothermal energy is assessed as having synergies with SDG 1 (no poverty) due to energy access, and mixed synergies and trade-offs in relation to SDG 3 (good health and well-being) due to reduced air pollution, but with some risks in relation to water pollution, and in relation to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), if it is not well managed. Nuclear power is assessed as having synergies with SDG 3 (good health and well-being) due to reduced air pollution, but potential trade-offs in relation to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) due to high water consumption, and water consumption issues are also possible in relation to many of the other mitigation options in the energy sector. Synergies are identified in relation to SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption) for nuclear power due to low material consumption. CCUS has been assessed as having trade-offs in relation to SDG 1 (no poverty) due to high costs and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) due to high water consumption. Synergies are related to SDG 3 (good health and well-being), and to SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) due to the facilitation of decarbonisation of industrial processes. Both synergies and trade-offs could arrive in relation to SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption), since some rare chemicals and other inputs could in some cases be used with large-scale applications.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Bioenergy use as a fuel is assessed as one of the energy-sector mitigation options with most synergies and trade-offs with the SDGs. There could be synergies with SDG 1 (no poverty), with SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). This option, however, if combined with CCS, can be expensive and can compromise SDG 1 (no poverty) due to the high costs involved.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) mitigation options are very closely linked to the SDGs and offer both synergies and trade-offs, which in many cases are highly dependent on the scale of implementation. All the mitigation options included in Figure 17.1 are assessed as potentially having synergies with SDG 1 (no poverty), but trade-offs could also happen if large areas are used for biocrops and taken away from other activities, thus causing poverty, as well as in relation to food costs if healthier diets are made more expensive. In relation to SDG 2 (zero hunger), most of the mitigation options are assessed as being associated with both synergies and trade-offs. Trade-offs are particularly a risk with large-scale applications of afforestation projects, bioenergy crops and other land-hungry activities, which can crowd out food production.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">SDG 3 (good health and well-being) can be supported by many mitigation options in the agriculture, forestry and food sectors, primarily due to the reduced environmental impacts, and the same is the case with SDG 14 (life below water) due to decreased nutrient loads, and SDG 15 (life on land) due to increased biodiversity, with the caveat however, that SDGs 14 and 15 could have both synergies and trade-offs dependent on land use. It is considered that there could be both synergies and trade-offs in relation to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) due to competition over land use related to the mitigation options reducing deforestation and reforestation and restoration, and the same is the case in relation to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) depending on the economic outcome of the mitigation options. Similarly, the mitigation option of reduced CH<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and N<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>O emissions from agriculture are assessed as having mixed impacts on SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) depending on innovative food production. The mitigation options of reforestation and forest management are assessed as having mixed impacts on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) depending on the involvement of local communities in projects. The assessment emphasises that the synergies and trade-offs of the mitigation options with the SDGs in this sector are very context- and scale-dependent, depending on how measures are carried out, for example, in relation to the enhanced production of renewables needed to replace fossil fuel-based products. If done on a massive scale and not adapted to local circumstances, there are adverse implications for food security, livelihoods and biodiversity.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">All the urban mitigation options that have been assessed are considered to have synergies with the SDGs, and in a few cases both synergies and trade-offs are identified. In general, many links between mitigation options in the urban area and the SDGs have been identified in the literature. Urban land use and spatial planning, for example, can support SDG 1 (no poverty), and can also reduce vulnerability to climate change if integrated planning is undertaken, while access to food (SDG 2: zero hunger), and water (SDG 6: clean water and sanitation) can also be achieved if supported by integrated planning. Electrification, district heating, and green-and-blue infrastructure in urban areas are expected to have synergies with all the SDGs addressed by the reviewed studies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Mitigation options like waste-prevention minimisation and management are also assessed as having many synergies with the SDGs, but trade-offs could depend on the application of air-pollution control technologies, and on the character of informal waste-recycling activities. The impacts of the possible synergies and/or trade-offs with the SDGs will change according to the specific urban context. Synergies and/or trade-offs may be more significant in certain contexts than others. Regarding the SDGs, urban mitigation can support shifting pathways of urbanisation towards sustainability. The feasibility of urban mitigation options is also malleable and can increase with more enablers. Strengthened institutional capacity that also supports the scale and coordination of the mitigation options can increase the synergies between urban mitigation options and the SDGs.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">As for the urban mitigation options, the reviewed building-sector studies reveal a lot of links between mitigation and the SDGs. Highly efficient building envelopes are expected to have synergies with the SDGs in all cases except those with potential trade-offs in relation to SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). Many SDG synergies are also identified for the building design and performance, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and efficient appliances mitigation options. However, some trade-offs could appear in relation to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) due to macroeconomic impacts of reduced energy consumption, decreasing prices and stranded investments. Similar issues related to the economic impacts of reduced energy demand are also highlighted for all the other mitigation options, including for the building sector. In relation to construction materials and the circular economy, some trade-offs have been identified in relation to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 15 (life on land) related to the use of bio-based materials.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Consideration of the building sector highlights important context-specific issues related to synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options and SDGs such as the economic impacts (synergies and trade-offs) associated with reduced energy demand, resulting in lower energy prices, energy-efficiency investments, the fostering of innovation and improvements in labour productivity. Furthermore, the distributional costs of some mitigation policies may hinder the implementation of these measures. In this case, appropriate access policies should be designed to shield poor households efficiently from the burden of carbon taxation. Under real-world conditions, improved cookstoves have shown smaller, and in many cases limited, long-term health and environmental impacts than expected, as the households use these stoves irregularly and inappropriately, and fail to maintain them, so that their usage declines over time. Specific distributional issues are highlighted in relation to various cookstove programmes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The mitigation options in the transportation sector are assessed as having synergies with SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being) due to reduced environmental pollution, with exceptions in relation to pollution from biofuels and the risks of traffic accidents. Trade-offs are also mentioned in relation SDG 2 (zero hunger) where the production of biofuels takes land away from food production. Synergies are assessed in relation to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). It is emphasised that some mitigation options, like the increased penetration of electric vehicles, require innovative business models, and that digitalisation and automatic vehicles will support the socio-economic structures that impede adoption of EVs and the urban structures that enable reduced car dependence. In conclusion, there is a need for investments in infrastructure that can support alternative fuels for light-duty vehicles (LDVs). The large-scale electrification of LDVs requires the expansion of low-carbon power systems, while charging or battery-swapping infrastructure is needed for some segments.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The mitigation options in the industrial sector have been assessed primarily as having synergies with meeting the SDGs. Several options, including energy efficiency, material recycling and electrification, are assessed has being able to create increased employment and business opportunities related to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), but material-efficiency improvements could reduce tax revenues. Electrification is assessed as having many synergies with SDGs, such as supporting SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 3 (good health and well-being). CCS applied in industry is assessed as having synergies in terms of the control of non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span> pollutants (such as sulphur dioxide), but increases in non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span> pollutants (such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and ammonia). The conclusion is that 15–25% additional energy will be required by CCS technologies compared with conventional plants, implying that production costs could increase significantly. For the industrial sector in general, it is concluded that the balance between synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options and SDGs in industry depends on technology and the scale of the sharing of co-benefits across regions, as well as on the sharing of benefits in business models over whole value chains.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Thus, a number of cross-sectoral conclusions on synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options and the SDGs appear from the overview provided in Figure 17.1. There are many synergies in all sectors between mitigation options and the SDGs, and in a few cases there are also significant trade-offs that it is very important to address, since they can compromise major SDGs including SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and in some cases SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). In particular, mitigation options in relation to land use, such as afforestation and reforestation and bioenergy crops, can in some cases imply trade-offs with access to food and local sharing of benefits, but synergies can also exist if proper land management and cross-sectoral policies take sustainable land use into account. The impacts and trade-offs for this sector are highly scale- and context-dependent, so the final outcome of mitigation policies should be considered in detail.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The urban systems and transportation could potentially achieve many synergies between mitigation policies and the SDGs, but integrated planning and infrastructure management are critical to avoiding trade-offs. Similarly, the buildings sector and industry have identified many potential synergies between mitigation options and the SDGs, but that raises issues related to the costs of new technologies, and in relation to households and buildings, important equity issues are emerging in relation to the ability of low-income groups to afford the introduction of new technologies. Altogether these cross-sectoral conclusions call for a need to support policies that aid coordination between different sectoral domains and that include context-specific assessments of the sharing of benefits and costs related to the implementation of mitigation options.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="17.4"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.4</span> Key Barriers and Enablers of the Transition: Synthesising Results </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-5-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This section provides a deep and broad synthesis of theory (<a class="section-link" data-title="Accelerating Transitions in the Context of Sustainable Development: Definitions and Theories" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.2">Section 17.2</a>) and evidence (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of the Results of Studies Where Decarbonisation Transitions are Framed Within the Context of Sustainable Development" href="/chapters/chapter-17#17.3">Section 17.3</a>) in order to identify the conditions that either enable or inhibit transitions to sustainable low-carbon futures. Following the literature on sustainability transitions (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16), the section finds that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing such transitions. Rather, marked departures from business as usual typically involve several factors, including technological innovations, shifts in markets, concerted efforts by scientists and civil-society organisations to raise awareness of the costs of continued emissions, social movements, policies and governance arrangements, and changes in belief systems and values.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">All of this comes together in a co-evolutionary process that has unfolded globally, internationally and locally over several decades (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hansen--2014">Hansen and Nygaard 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2017">Rogge et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sorman--2020">Sorman et al. 2020</a>), and that may be guided or facilitated by interventions that target leverage points in the underlying development path (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burch--2021">Burch and Di Bella 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Leventon--2021">Leventon et al. 2021</a>). While transitions necessarily follow context-specific trajectories, more general lessons can be drawn by comparing the empirical details with both system-level and narrower explanations of change.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Sections 17.2 and 17.3 show that transitions often face multiple barriers, including infrastructure lock-in, behavioural, cultural and institutional inertia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Markard--2020">Markard et al. 2020</a>), trade-offs between transitions and other social or political priorities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2016">Chu 2016</a>), cost and a reliable (and growing) supply of renewable-energy technologies and constituent materials (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garc%C3%ADa-Olivares--2018">García-Olivares et al. 2018</a>). Transitions away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy-based systems, for instance, will require significant land-use decisions to avoid negative trade-offs with biodiversity and food security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Capell%C3%A1n-P%C3%A9rez--2017">Capellán-Pérez et al. 2017</a>). Previous sections underline a related need to move beyond focusing on ‘rational’ assessments of the costs and benefits of policies and technologies to involve people at all levels in order to overcome these multiple barriers. A transition to a lower carbon system is unlikely to happen even if models find it technically feasible and cost-effective. Rather, achieving a transition requires breaking locked-in high-carbon technological trajectories, path dependencies and resistance to change from the industries and actors that are benefiting from the current system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogge--2017">Rogge et al. 2017</a>). Lock-in effects may be weaker in sectors and policy areas where fewer technologies exist, potentially opening the door to innovations that embed the climate in broader sustainability objectives (e.g., technologies and innovations that support the integration of food, water and energy goals). Such effects may still happen when there are significant information asymmetries and high-cost barriers to action, as can occur when working across multiple climate and development-related sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kemp--2017">Kemp and Never 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, the same conditions that may serve to impede a transition (i.e., organisational structure, behaviour, technological lock-in) can also be ‘flipped’ to enable it (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burch--2010">Burch 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2017">Lee et al. 2017</a>), while the framing of policies that are relevant to the sustainable development agenda can also create a stronger basis and stronger policy support. The technological developments and broader cultural changes that may generate new social demands on infrastructure to contribute to sustainable development will involve a process of social learning and awareness building (<a class="reference-link" href="#Naber--2017">Naber et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sengers--2019">Sengers et al. 2019</a>). However, it is also important to note that strong shocks to these systems, including accelerated climate change impacts, economic crises and political changes, may provide crucial openings for accelerated transitions to sustainable systems through fundamental institutional changes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Broto--2014">Broto et al. 2014</a>). The global COVID-19 pandemic is one such shock that has sparked widespread conversations about recovery that is fundamentally more sustainable, equitable and resilient (<a class="reference-link" href="#McNeely--2021">McNeely and Munasinghe 2021</a>). Key enabling conditions appear to be individual and collective actions, including leadership and education; financial, material, social and technical drivers that foster innovation; robust national and regional innovation systems that enhance technological diffusion (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wieczorek--2018">Wieczorek 2018</a>); supportive policy and governance dynamics at multiple levels that permit both agility and coherence (<a class="reference-link" href="#G%C3%B6pel--2016">Göpel et al. 2016</a>); measures to recognise and address the challenges to equality inherent in the transition; and long-range, holistic planning that explicitly seeks synergies between climate change and sustainable development while avoiding trade-offs.

Individual action suggests aggregated but uncoordinated actions taken by individuals, whereas collective sustainability actions involve coordination, a process of participation and governance that may ensure more efficient, equitable and effective outcomes.

For example, in the transport sector, individuals can quickly become accustomed to personal vehicles, making it difficult for them to transition to sustainable, low-carbon modes of public transport. Demand for high-carbon transportation may also be locked-in, and habits reinforced, if low-cost housing (for instance) is not sufficiently served by more sustainable (i.e., mass transit, safe cycling and walking infrastructure) transportation options (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mattioli--2020">Mattioli et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This is made all the more challenging because car-manufacturing ‘incumbents’ utilise information campaigns directed at the public, pursue lobbying and consulting with policymakers, and set technical standards that privilege the status quo and prevent the entry of more sustainable innovations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smink--2015">Smink et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Turnheim--2019">Turnheim and Nykvist 2019</a>).

For instance, in Delhi, India, attempts to introduce ostensibly more sustainable bus rapid transit (BRT) systems failed in part due to an arguably top-down approach that had limited public support. It may nonetheless be difficult to win public support (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bachus--2018">Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018</a>), and even grassroots initiatives may themselves be contested and dynamic, making it difficult to generate the collective push to drive a bottom-up transition forward (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hakansson--2018">Hakansson 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, dominant, top-down approaches and local, grassroots ‘alternative’ approaches and values do overlap and interact. For example, in Manchester, UK, dominant and alternative discourses interact with each other to create sustainable transformations through re-scaling (decentralising) energy generation, creating local engagement with sustainability, supporting green infrastructure to reduce costs, reclaiming local land, transforming industrial infrastructure and creating examples of sustainable living (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hodson--2017">Hodson et al. 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Embedding local values in higher-level policy frameworks is also significant for forest communities in Nepal and Uganda.

Sustainable entrepreneurs (SEs), for instance, are described as those who participate in the development of an innovation while simultaneously being rooted in the incumbent energy-intensive system. SE actors who have developed longer-term relationships, both formal and informal, with the public authorities can have considerable influence on developing novel renewable-energy technologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gasbarro--2017">Gasbarro et al. 2017</a>). Institutions and policies that nurture the activities of sustainable entrepreneurs, in particular small- and medium-sized enterprises (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burch--2016">Burch et al. 2016</a>), can facilitate and strengthen transitions toward more sustainable development pathways, as can more fundamental adjustments to underlying business models, rather than relying only on incremental adjustments in the efficiency with which resources are used (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burch--2021">Burch and Di Bella 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The creation and growth of sustainable energy and clean-tech clusters enable economic development and transformation on regional scales. Such clusters can put pressure on incumbent technologies and rules to accelerate energy transitions.

However, there may be some limitations in using carbon pricing alone (rather than in combination with flexible regulations and incentives) where market failures hinder low-carbon investments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Campiglio--2016">Campiglio 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2019">World Bank 2019</a>) and high political costs are incurred (Van Der Ploeg 2011).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Many forms of transformational change to energy systems are not possible when financial systems still privilege investing in unsustainable, carbon-intensive sectors. One of the root causes of the failure of traditional financial systems is the undervaluation of natural capital and unsettled property-right issues that are associated with it. The exclusion of proper rents for scarcities or for global and local externalities, including climate change, can undermine larger-scale changes to energy systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clark--2018">Clark et al. 2018</a>). But even smaller-scale low-carbon energy and infrastructure projects can fail to get off the ground if uncertainty and investment risk discourage project planning and bank-lending programmes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bolton--2016">Bolton et al. 2016</a>). The EU’s previous actions regarding the ‘shareholder maximisation norm’ and non-binding measures have created path dependencies, limiting its flexibility in creating sustainable financial legislation. However, the Sustainable Finance Initiative and the Single Market may prove to be ‘policy hotspots’ in encouraging sustainable finance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahlstr%C3%B6m--2019">Ahlström 2019</a>). Taking advantage of these hotspots may be crucial in overcoming path dependencies and setting new ones in motion.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">One possible positive turn in this regard is the acceleration in investing in the environment (impact and ESG) globally: for instance, there is evidence that some institutional investors are divesting from coal, potentially auguring well for the future (<a class="reference-link" href="#Richardson--2017">Richardson 2017</a>).

Also, the degrowth movement, with its focus on sustainability over profitability, has the potential to speed up transformations using alternative practices such as fostering the exchange of non-monetary goods and services if large numbers of stakeholders want to invest in these areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chiengkul--2017">Chiengkul 2017</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="17.4.4"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">17.4.4</span> Institutional Capacities and Multi-level Governance <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-16-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Capable institutions and multi-level governance often support the inter-agency coordination and stakeholder coalitions that drive sustainable transitions. Such institutions and governance arrangements are frequently required to formulate and implement the multi-sectoral policies that spur the adoption and scaling of innovative solutions to climate change and other sustainable development challenges. For example, such institutional and governance conditions have helped support the industrial policies that will be needed to spread renewables through the creation of domestic supply chains (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zenghelis--2020">Zenghelis 2020</a>) or to pilot CDR methods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Quarton--2020">Quarton and Samsatli 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, government agencies with climate and other remits do not always work well together: the absence of coordination and consensus-building mechanisms can further deepen inter-agency conflicts that stall a transition. These challenges appear not only within but also between levels of decision-making. Studies of developing megacities, for instance, have found the lack of mechanisms promoting vertical cross-level integration to be a sizeable constraint on decarbonisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Canitez--2019">Canitez 2019</a>). Differences in perspectives across non-state actors can similarly frustrate transitions in areas such as green buildings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Song--2020">Song et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Here coordination complicates matters: coalition-building may require mutually reinforcing changes to institutions and policies. For example, decentralised renewable energy has made progress in Argentina, but consumer electricity subsidies give agencies and firms supporting conventional energy an advantage over those promoting renewable energy. Similarly, the lack of concrete guidance in green finance policies can deprive government agencies and other stakeholders of the information needed to balance ecological and financial goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2016">Wang and Zhi 2016</a>). Many of these challenges can be particularly formidable in developing countries, where agencies lack sufficient financial and other capacities. A lack of government funds to cover ongoing maintenance costs along with resource shortages in rural locations can pose constraints on sustainable energy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schaube--2018">Schaube et al. 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Building inter-agency or multiple stakeholders is frequently challenging because of the mutually reinforcing interactions between institutions and ideas. The imperceptible embedding of long-standing development paradigms (such as ‘grow now, clean up later’) in agency rules and standard operating procedures can make changes to governance arrangements challenging. This is partly because these rules and procedures can also shape the interests of key decision-makers (e.g., the head of an environmental agency). For some, this suggests a need to look not just at changing prevailing ideas and interests, but also at broader institutional and governance arrangements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2011">Kern 2011</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, institutional and governance reforms can be more than a technical exercise. Political, economic and other power relations can lock-in dominant institutional and economic structures, making the integration of climate and sustainable development agendas exceedingly difficult. For example, though there have been recent reforms, the initial lack of early progress in Australia’s energy transition is partly attributable to institutions of political economy being oriented to providing steady supplies of affordable fossil fuels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Warren--2016">Warren et al. 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This suggests that it is important to look closely at the pre-existing political economic system as well as the institutional context and capacities in assessing the prospects for transitions to sustainability. Furthermore, this is how existing institutions interact with ideas that often strengthen lock-ins. To illustrate, studies have shown that the status-quo orientations of leaders (including decision-makers’ disciplinary backgrounds, world views and perceptions of risk) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Willis--2018">Willis 2018</a>), as well as the organisational culture and management paradigms within which they operate, affect the speed and ambitions of climate policies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rickards--2014">Rickards et al. 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Some studies have focused on factors that can break institutional and ideational lock-ins (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arranz--2017">Arranz 2017</a>), while others have found that intentional higher-level (or, in the language of socio-technical transitions, ‘landscape’) pressures can be the destabilising force needed to move transitions forward (<a class="reference-link" href="#Falcone--2015">Falcone and Sica 2015</a>). Often the state or national government (as the sovereign that determines how resources are used and allocated) can play a key role in destabilising incumbent energy regimes, a role that is significantly strengthened by public support (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arranz--2017">Arranz 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Avelino--2016">Avelino et al. 2016</a>). However, this role is not limited to government insiders. In some contexts, regime outsiders have also played a pivotal role in destabilising regimes by combining persuasive narratives that gain market influence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arranz--2017">Arranz 2017</a>). Carbon-intensive luxury goods and services for wealthy consumers, for instance, especially if applied at the ‘acceleration’ phase of a transition, can help transform long-term social practices and behaviour and dissolve the ‘structural imperative for growth’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wiedmann--2020">Wiedmann et al. 2020</a>). In a similar fashion, environmental taxes can remove ‘locked-in’ technology and place pressure on dominant regimes to become more sustainable (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bachus--2018">Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In many contexts, it is not multiple institutional and policy variables that come together to break unsustainable inertias. In South Korea, where the state was an initiator and enabler of change, the clean-energy transition took much longer than anticipated due to private-sector resistance. However, when policymakers focused on incorporating adaptive learning and flexibility into their decision-making, public- and private-sector interests gradually converged and joined with top-down policymaking to drive the transition forward (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2019">Lee et al. 2019</a>).

As such, many of the claims reviewed involve not only increasing the speed of the transition but also ensuring that it is just, equitable and delivers a wider range of environmental and social benefits. A sustainability transition requires removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high emissions (quality and depth) while aligning the interests of different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Interest in a sustainability transition has grown steadily over the history of the IPCC and of climate and related policy processes. That interest hit a high point in 2015 with the Paris Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs. It has continued to remain high as countries have issued NDCs on climate change, VNRs on the SDGs and, in some instances, integrated climate and SDG plans (or similarly themed integrated actions, e.g., circular economy plans). Interest has also gained momentum as local governments, businesses and other stakeholders have followed suit with climate change- or SDG-related plans.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Implementing many of the recent pledges, however, has proved challenging. Part of the challenge is a need to address everything from public policies and prevailing technologies to individual lifestyles and social norms, to governance arrangements and institutions with associated political economy implications. These factors can lock-in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering the momentum needed for large-scale transformations of socio-economic systems. Another consideration is that transition pathways are likely to vary across and within countries due to different development levels, starting points, differential vulnerabilities, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and other contextual factors.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Even with this diversity, prominent lines of economic, institutional, psychological and systems thinking have reflected on interventions that can enable transitions. Because these disciplines often focus on different levels of analysis and draw upon diverse analytical methods and empirical evidence, the recommended interventions also tend to vary. For instance, economic arguments often point to the need for targeted regulation or investments, institutional claims centre on multi-level governance reforms, and psychology encourages participation to change mindsets and social norms. Systems-level perspectives offer a useful frame for bringing together these views, but may not capture the richness and details of them treated separately. Greater inter- and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the more focused interventions and show how they work together in a system. Such research will be particularly important for working on the concern running through these studies: strengthening synergies between climate and the broader sustainable development agenda.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">National and sub-national, sectoral and cross-sectoral, short- and long-term transition studies have assessed the links between sustainable development and mitigation policies and synergies and the trade-offs between the different policy domains. Some general conclusions can be drawn on synergies and trade-offs, despite the actual impacts of policy implementation depending on scale, context and the development starting point.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">From a cross-sectoral perspective, it can be concluded that the AFOLU sector offers many low-cost mitigation options with synergetic SDG impacts, which, however, can also create trade-offs between land use for food, energy, forest and biodiversity. Some options can help to mitigate such trade-offs, like agricultural practices, forest conservation and soil carbon sequestration. Lifestyle changes, including dietary changes and reduced food waste, could jointly support the SDGs and mitigation. Industry also offers several mitigation options with SDG synergies, for example, related to energy efficiency and the circular economy. Some of the renewable-energy options in industry could indicate some trade-offs in relation to land use, with implications for food- and water security and costs. Cities provide a promising basis for implementing mitigation with SDG synergies, particularly if urban planning, transportation, infrastructure and settlements are coordinated jointly. Similarly, studies of the building sector have identified many synergies between the SDGs and mitigation, but there are issues related to the costs of new technologies. Also, in relation to households and buildings, important equity issues emerge due to the ability of low-income groups to afford the introduction of new technologies. Altogether these cross-sectoral conclusions create a need for policies to address both synergies and trade-offs, as well as for coordination between different sectoral domains. Context-specific assessments of synergies and trade-offs are here important, as is sharing the benefits and costs associated with mitigation policies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Several opportunities for creating SDG synergies and avoiding trade-offs have also been identified in relation to integrated adaptation and mitigation policies. The AFOLU sector has a large potential for integrating adaptation and mitigation policies related to agriculture, bioenergy crops, forestry and water use. As was concluded for mitigation options, integrated adaptation and mitigation policies also entail the risks of creating trade-offs in relation to food, water, energy access and biodiversity. There are several potentially strong links between climate change adaptation in industry and climate change adaptation more generally. Various supply chains can be affected by climate change, and mitigation options related to energy and water supply can be disrupted by climate events, implying that great benefits may come from integrating adaptation in industrial planning efforts. Adaptation options in industry can imply increasing the demand for packaging materials such as plastics and for access to refrigeration, which are also major sources of GHG emissions, which then would require further mitigation options. Mitigation and the co-benefits of adaptation in urban areas in relation to air quality, health, green jobs and equality issues can in most cases be synergetic and can also support the SDGs. One exception are compact cities, with their trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation because decreasing urban sprawl can increase the risks of flooding and heat stress. Detailed mapping of mitigation and adaptation in urban areas shows that there are many, very close interactions between the two policy domains and that coordinated governance across sectors is therefore called for.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Meeting the ambitions of the Paris Agreement will require phasing out fossil fuels from energy systems, which is technically possible and is estimated to be relatively low in cost. However, studies also show that replacing fossil fuels with renewables can have major synergies and trade-offs with a broader agenda of sustainable development if a balance is established in relation to land use, food security and job creation (<a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2018">McCollum et al. 2018</a>). Furthermore, the transition to low-emission pathways will require policy efforts that also address the emissions locked-in to existing infrastructure, like power plants, factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure already in use: for example, today coal-fired power plants account for 30% of all energy-related emissions. Thus, even though the transition away from fossil fuels is desirable and technically feasible, it is still largely constrained by existing fossil fuel-based infrastructure and the existence of stranded investments. The ‘committed’ emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure may consume all the remaining carbon budget in the 1.5°C scenario or two thirds of the carbon budget in the 2°C scenario.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Stranded hydrocarbon assets, including hydrocarbon resources and the infrastructure from which they are produced, and investments made in exploration and production activities, are likely to become unusable, lose value or may end up as liabilities before the end of the anticipated economic lifetime. This phenomenon is rapidly becoming a global reality as social norms change and the pressure to reduce emissions mounts. Energy and other forms of structural inequities are likely to make the transition planning more challenging, especially given stranded assets.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Countries dependent on fossil fuel income will need to forego these revenues to keep well within the Paris Agreement requirements and align with the rapidly growing divestment movement. Climate injustice, energy poverty and COVID-19 have reduced the space and manoeuverability for developing countries to innovate and use surplus funds to procure new and clean technologies. A rising debt burden already hamstrings many. Decisions on how to spend the remaining carbon budget and who has the right to decide on what to do with existing fossil fuels reflect the complexity of the transition and its non-linear character. Given the asymmetrical dimension of energy production, distribution and use, it is likely that stranded assets will have implications for oil-producing countries, especially for early producers who perceive that new-found oil and gas will open doors to new forms of prosperity.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While the transitional drivers are not in place in some developing countries, that is, technology, infrastructure, knowledge, and finance, among others, investing in new forms of renewable energy for the land, energy, or water sectors will see the emergence of a more diversified economy and one less vulnerable to carbon and other exogenous risks. The transition away from fossil fuels will come with hard choices. Still, these choices can enable a sustainable development world and reduce the many asymmetries and injustices inherent in the current system, not least the gaping energy disparities that divide the developed and the developing world.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Equality and justice are central dimensions of transitions in the context of sustainable development. Viewing climate change through the lens of justice requires a focus on the protection of vulnerable populations from the impacts of climate change, addressing the unequal distribution of the costs and consequences of the transitions themselves, including for those whose livelihoods are rooted in fossil fuel-based sectors, and developing more creative and participatory processes for envisioning an equitable decarbonised world. Neglecting issues of justice will have implications for the pace, scale and quality of the transition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Ultimately, the evidence demonstrates that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing transitions. A constellation of elements come into play, including technological innovations, shifts in markets, social and behavioural dynamics, and governance arrangements. Indeed, transitions require an examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs and the structures that shape behaviour, as well as the dynamics of social movements and education at multiple levels. Likewise, technological and social innovation both play an important role in enabling transitions, highlighting the importance of multi-institutional and multi-stakeholder actors building institutional support networks, facilitating collaboration between sectors and actors, and promoting learning and social change. Financial tools and economic instruments are crucial enablers, since many forms of transformational change to energy systems are not possible when financial systems still privilege investing in unsustainable, carbon-intensive sectors. These instruments are deployed within the context of the multi-level governance of climate change, which suggests the importance of complementary policies and institutions that simultaneously integrate across multiple sectors and scales to address the multiple sources of lock-in that are shaping the current carbon-intensive energy system. Systems-oriented approaches, which holistically address the intersections among climate, water and energy (for instance), have significant potential to reveal and help avoid trade-offs, foster experimentation, and deliver a range of co-benefits on the path towards sustainable development.</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-heading" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 17.1 | 	Will decarbonisation efforts slow or accelerate sustainable development transitions?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 17.1 | Will decarbonisation efforts slow or accelerate sustainable development transitions?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-19-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Sustainable development offers a comprehensive pathway to achieving ambitious climate change mitigation goals.

Nonetheless, many climate change mitigation policies could generate incomes, new jobs and other benefits. Capturing these benefits could require specific policies and investments to be targeted directly towards including all parts of society in the new activities and industries created by the climate change mitigation policies, and that activities that are reduced in the context of transitions to a low-carbon future, including industries and geographical areas, are seeing new opportunities. Poor understanding of how governance at multiple levels can meet these challenges to the transition may fail to make significant progress in relation to national policies and a global climate agreement. It may therefore either support or weaken the climate architecture, thus constituting a limiting factor.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 17.3 | 	How critical are the roles of institutions in accelerating the transition and what can governance enable?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 17.3 | How critical are the roles of institutions in accelerating the transition and what can governance enable?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-21-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">Institutions are critical in accelerating the transition towards sustainable development: they can help to shape climate change response strategies in terms of both adaptation and mitigation. Local institutions are the custodians of critical adaptation services, ranging from the mobilisation of resources, skills development and capacity-building to the dissemination of critical strategies. Transitions towards sustainable development are mediated by actors within particular institutions, the governance mechanisms they use as implementing tools and the political coalitions they form to enable action. Patterns of production and consumption have implications for a low-carbon development, and many of these patterns can act as barriers or opportunities towards sustainable development. Trade policies, international economic issues and international financial flows can positively support the speed and scale of the transition; alternatively, they can have negative impacts on policies that may inhibit the process. Nonetheless, contextual factors are a fundamental part of the change process, and institutions and their governance systems provide pathways that can influence contextual realities on the ground. For instance, politically vested interests may lead powerful lobby groups or coalition networks to influence the direction of the transition, or they could put pressure on a given political elite through the imposition of regulatory standards, taxation, incentives and policies that may speed or delay the transition process. Civil-society institutions, such as NGOs or research centres, can act as effective governance ‘watchdogs’ in the transition process, particularly when they exercise a challenge function and question government actions in respect of transitions related to sustainable development.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">References</span></h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-8-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Abson--2017" lang="en-GB">Abson, D.J. et al., 2017: Leverage points for sustainability transformation. <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Ambio</span>, <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">46(1) </span> , 30–39, doi:10.1007/s13280-016-0800-y.</p><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Addison--2018" lang="en-GB">Addison, T. and A.R.
