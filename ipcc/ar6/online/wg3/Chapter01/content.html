Climate mitigation has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs. There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation. However, recent evidence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions. Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and capabilities. Given the differences in GHG emissions contributions, degree of vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep decarbonisation. Achieving sustainable global development and eradicating poverty as enshrined in the 17 SDGS would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale. Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability. International cooperation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development. <!-- -->{1.4, 1.6, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 17}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The transition to a low-carbon economy depends on a wide range of closely intertwined drivers and constraints, including policies and technologies where notable advances over the past decade have opened up new and large-scale opportunities for deep decarbonisation, and for alternative development pathways which could deliver multiple social and developmental goals (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">robust evidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">, </span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">medium agreement</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">)</span>.

At the same time, attention to and support for climate policies and low-carbon societal transition has generally increased, as the impacts have become more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and balance of high- and low-carbon investments. COVID-19 has strained public finances, and integrating climate finance into ongoing recovery strategies, nationally and internationally, can accelerate the diffusion of low-carbon technologies and also help poorer countries to minimise future stranded assets.

Effective governance of climate change entails strong action across multiple jurisdictions and decision-making levels, including regular evaluation and learning. Choices that cause climate change as well as the processes for making and implementing relevant decisions involve a range of non-nation state actors such as cities, businesses, and civil society organisations. At global, national and sub-national levels, climate change actions are interwoven with and embedded in the context of much broader social, economic and political goals. Therefore, the governance required to address climate change has to navigate power, political, economic, and social dynamics at all levels of decision-making. Effective climate-governing institutions, and openness to experimentation on a variety of institutional arrangements, policies and programmes can play a vital role in engaging stakeholders and building momentum for effective climate action. <!-- -->{1.4, 1.9, Chapters 8, 15 and 17}</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="1.1"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">1.1</span>Introduction </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-2-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">This report (AR6 WGIII) aims to assess new literature on climate mitigation including implications for global sustainable development.

At the same time, the Paris Agreement (PA) and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), both adopted in 2015, set out a globally agreed agenda within which climate mitigation efforts must be located. Along with a better understanding of the physical science basis of climate change (AR6 WGI), and vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptation (AR6 WGII), the landscape of climate mitigation has evolved substantially since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Since (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC 2014a</a>), climate mitigation policies around the world have grown in both number and shape (Chapter 13). However, while the average rate of annual increase of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions has declined (<a class="section-link" data-title="Global and Regional Emissions" href="/chapters/chapter-1#1.3.2">Section 1.3.2</a>), GHG emissions globally continued to rise, underlining the urgency of the mitigation challenge (Chapters 2 and 3). Over 20 countries have cut absolute emissions alongside sustained economic growth, but the scale of mitigation action across countries remains varied and is generally much slower than the pace required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement (Sections 1.3.2 and 2.7.2). Per capita GHG emissions between countries even at similar stages of economic development (based on GDP per capita) vary by a factor of three (Figure 1.6) and by more than two on consumption basis (<a class="section-link" data-title="Past and Present Trends of Consumption-based CO" href="/chapters/chapter-2#2.3">Section 2.3</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) underlined that humanity is now living with the ‘unifying lens of the Anthropocene’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC 2018a</a>, pp. 52–53), that requires a sharpened focus on the impact of human activity on the climate system and the planet more broadly given ‘planetary boundaries’ (Steffen et al. 2015) including interdependencies of climate change and biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021). Recent literature assessed by Working Groups I and II of this AR6 underlines the urgency of climate action as cumulative CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions, along with other greenhouses gases (GHGs), drives the temperature change. Across AR6, global temperature changes are defined relative to the period 1850–1900, as in SR1.5 and collaboration with WGI enabled the use of AR6-calibrated emulators to assure consistency across the three Working Groups. The remaining ‘carbon budgets’ (see Annex I: Glossary) associated with 1.5°C and 2°C temperature targets equate to about one (for 1.5°C) to three (for 2°C) decades of current emissions, as from 2020, but with significant variation depending on multiple factors including other gases (Figure 2.7, and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3). For an outline of the WGIII approach to mitigation scenarios, emission pathways implied by the Paris goals, and the timing of peak and ‘net zero’ (see Glossary and FAQ 1.3), see <a class="section-link" data-title="Emissions Scenarios and Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs)" href="/chapters/chapter-1#1.5">Section 1.5</a> and Chapter 3.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Strong differences remain in responsibilities for, and capabilities to, take climate action within and between countries. These differences, as well as differences in the impact of climate change, point to the role of collective action in achieving urgent and ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development, with attention to issues of equity and fairness as highlighted in several chapters of the report (Chapters 4, 5, 14, 15 and 17).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Innovation and industrial development of key technologies in several relevant sectors have transformed prospects for mitigation at much lower cost than previously assessed (Chapters 2 and 6–12). Large reductions in the cost of widely available renewable energy technologies, along with energy efficient technologies and behavioural changes (Chapters 5 and 9–11), can enable societies to provide services with much lower emissions. However, there are still significant differences in the ability to access and utilise low-carbon technologies across the world (Chapters 4, 15 and 16). New actors, including cities, businesses, and numerous non-state transnational alliances have emerged as important players in the global effort to tackle climate change (Chapters 13–16).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Along with continued development of concepts, models and technologies, there have been numerous insights from both the successes and failures of mitigation action that can inform future policy design and climate action.

At the same time, some climate mitigation policies can run counter to sustainable development and eradicating poverty, which highlights the need to consider trade-offs alongside benefits. Examples include synergies between climate policy and improved air quality, reducing premature deaths and morbidity (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014b">IPCC 2014b</a>, Figure SPM.6) (AR6 WGI Sections 6.6.3 and 6.7.3), but there would be trade-offs if policy raises net energy bills, with distributional implications. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) also emphasises important synergies and trade-offs, bringing new light on the link between healthy and sustainable food consumption and emissions caused by the agricultural sector.

The AR5 noted that greater cooperation would ensue if policies are perceived as fair and equitable by all countries along the spectrum of economic development – implying a need for equitable sharing of the effort.

After COVID-19 however, no country is in this state. Very low interest rates amplify opportunities for large-scale investments which could bring ‘economic multiplier’ benefits, especially if they help to build the industries and infrastructures for further clean growth (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hepburn--2020">Hepburn et al. 2020</a>). However, the capability to mobilise low-interest finance varies markedly across countries and large public debts – including bringing some developing countries close to default – undermine both the political appetite and feasibility of large-scale clean investments.

However, the terminology of drivers and constraints have been chosen here to reflect the fact that each of these factors can serve as an enabling condition or a constraint to ambitious climate action depending on the context and how they are deployed. Often one sees the factors exerting both push and pull forces at the same time in the same and across different scales. For example, finance and investments can serve as a barrier or an enabler to climate action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2021">Battiston et al. 2021</a>). Similarly, political economy factors can align in favour of ambitious climate action or act in ways that inhibit strong cooperation and low-carbon transition. The other key insight from the assessment of the system drivers and constraints undertaken below is that none of the factors or conditions by themselves is more or less important than the others. In addition to being deeply intertwined all the factors matter in different measures with each exacting more or less force depending on the prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context. Often achieving accelerated mitigation would require effort to bring several of the factors in alignment in and across multiple levels of political or governance scales.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="1.4.1"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">1.4.1</span> Services, Sectors and Urbanisation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-7-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Human activities drive emissions primarily through the demand for a wide range of services such as food, shelter, heating/cooling, goods, travel, communication, and entertainment.

With its significant negative impact on natural systems, food security and infrastructure, loss of lives and territories, species extinction, conflict health, among several other risks, climate change poses a serious threat to development and wellbeing in both rich and poor countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2007">IPCC 2007</a>, 2011a, 2014a, 2018b, 2019b).

The SDGs represent medium-term goals, and long-term sustainability requires continued effort to keep the world along a climate-resilient development path.

Policy design can encourage coalitions to form that sustain momentum by supporting further policy development to accelerate decarbonisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2018">Roberts et al. 2018</a>), for example, by generating concentrated benefits to coalition members (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bernstein--2018">Bernstein and Hoffmann 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Meckling--2019">Meckling 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Millar--2020">Millar et al. 2020</a>), as with renewable feed-in tariffs (FiTs) in Germany (<a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2018">Michaelowa et al. 2018</a>). Coalitions may also be sustained by overarching framings, especially to involve actors (e.g., NGOs) for whom the benefits of climate policy are not narrowly economic.

exceptional degree of path-dependence in urban systems (Chapter 8) and associated buildings (Chapter 9) and transport (Chapter 10) sectors, but it is a feature across almost all the major emitting sectors. The (typically expected) operating lifetimes of existing carbon-emitting assets would involve anticipated emissions (often but inaccurately called ‘committed’ emissions in the literature), substantially exceeding the remaining carbon budgets associated with 1.5°C pathways (Chapter 2.7). Ongoing GHG-intensive investments, including those from basic industrialisation in poorer countries, are adding to this.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The fact that investors anticipate a level of fossil fuel use that is not compatible with severe climate constraints creates a clear risk of ‘<span class="•-Condensed-italic">stranded assets’</span> facing these investors (Box 6.2), and others who depend on them, which itself raises issues of equity. A multi-dimensional/multi-framework assessment helps to explain why such investments have continued, even in rich countries, and the consequent risks, and the complexity of shifting such investments in all countries.

Aggregate economic frameworks generally indicate carbon pricing (on principles which extend to other gases) as the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, notwithstanding various market failures which complicate this logic. <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch01.html#footnote-000">9</a> </span></span>The High-Level Commission on carbon pricing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stern--2017">Stern and Stiglitz 2017</a>) estimated an appropriate range as USD40–80 tCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> in 2020, rising steadily thereafter.

The fact that this has never even been seriously considered (outside some efforts in the EU) may reflect the exceptional sovereignty sensitivities around taxation and cultural differences around the role of markets. However, carbon-pricing concepts can be important outside of the traditional market (‘tax or trading’) applications. A ’social cost of carbon’ can be used to evaluate government and regulatory decisions, to compensate for inadequate carbon prices in actual markets, and by companies to reflect the external damage of their emissions and strategic risks of future carbon controls (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2020">Zhou and Wen 2020</a>).

The realities of the ‘drivers and constraints’ detailed in Section 4, the ‘glocal’ nature of climate change, the divided authority in world politics, diverse preferences of public and private entities across the spectrum, and pervasive suspicions of free riding, imply the challenge as how to incrementally deepen cooperation in a polycentric global system, rather than seeking a single, integrated governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keohane--2016">Keohane and Victor 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Crucially, climate governance takes place in the context of embedded power relations, operating in global, national and local contexts.

Investigating the distribution and role of hard and soft power resources, capacities and power relations within and across different jurisdictional levels is therefore important to uncover hindrances to effective climate governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marquardt--2017">Marquardt 2017</a>). Institutions at international and national levels are also critical as they have the ability to mediate the power and interest of actors, and sustain cooperation based on equity and fair rules and outcomes. Governance, in fact, helps to align and moderate the interests of actors as well as to shift perceptions, including the negative, burden-sharing narratives that often accompany discussion about climate action, especially in international negotiations. It is also useful for engaging the wider public and international networks in imagining low-carbon societies (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Levy--2013">Levy and Spicer 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Milkoreit--2017">Milkoreit 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nikoleris--2017">Nikoleris et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wapner--2017">Wapner and Elver 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bengtsson%20Sonesson--2019">Bengtsson Sonesson et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fatemi--2020">Fatemi et al. 2020</a>).

The Paris Agreement and the SDGs provided a new international context, but global intergovernmental cooperation has been under intense stress. Growing direct impacts of climate change are unambiguous and movements of protest and activism – in countries and transnational organisations at many levels – have grown. Global emissions growth had slowed but not stopped up to 2018/19, albeit with more diverse national trends. Growing numbers of countries have adopted ‘net zero’ CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> and/or GHG emission goals and decarbonisation or low-carbon growth strategies, but the current NDCs to 2030 collectively would barely reduce global emissions below present levels (<a class="section-link" data-title="Some Other Key Trends and Developments" href="/chapters/chapter-1#1.3.3">Section 1.3.3</a>). An unfolding technology revolution is making significant contributions in some countries, but as yet its global impact is limited. Global climate change can only be tackled within, and if integrated with, the wider context of sustainable development, and related social goals including equity concerns. Countries and their populations have many conflicting priorities. Developing countries in particular have multiple urgent needs associated with earlier stages of sustainable development as reflected in the non-climate SDGs. Developed countries are amongst the most unsustainable in terms of overall consumption, but also face social constraints particularly arising from distributional impacts of climate policies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The assessment of the key drivers for, and barriers against mitigation undertaken in this chapter underscore the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of climate mitigation. Historically, much of the academic analysis of mitigating climate change, particularly global approaches, has focused on modelling costs and pathways, and discussion about ‘optimal’ policy instruments. Developments since AR5 have continued to highlight the role of a wide range of factors intersecting the political, economic, social and institutional domains. Yet despite such complexities, there are signs of progress emerging from years of policy effort in terms of technology, social attitudes, and emission reductions in some countries, with tentative signs of impact on the trajectory of global emissions. The challenge remains how best to urgently scale up and speed up the climate mitigation effort at all scales – from local to global – to achieve the level of mitigation needed to address the problem as indicated by climate science. A related challenge is how to ensure that mitigation effort and any associated benefits of action are distributed fairly within and between countries and aligned to the overarching objective of global sustainable development. Lastly, globally effective and efficient mitigation will require international cooperation especially in the realms of finance and technology.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Multiple frameworks of analytic assessment, adapted to the realities of climate change mitigation, are therefore required. We identified four main groups. <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Aggregate economic</span> frameworks – including environmental costs or goals, and with due attention to implied behavioural, distributional and dynamic assumptions – can provide insights about trade-offs, cost-effectiveness and policies for delivering agreed goals. <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Ethical frameworks</span> are equally essential to inform both international and domestic discourse and decisions, including the relationship with international (and intergenerational) responsibilities, related financial systems, and domestic policy design in all countries. Explicit frameworks for analysing <span class="•-Condensed-italic">transition and transformation</span> across multiple sectors need to draw on both socio-technical transition literatures, and those on social transformation. Finally, literatures on <span class="•-Condensed-italic">psychology, behaviour and political sciences</span> can illuminate obstacles that have impeded progress to date and suggest ways to overcome them.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">No single analytical framework, or single discipline, on its own can offer a comprehensive assessment of climate change mitigation. Together they point to the relevance of growing literatures and discourses on Just Transitions, and the role of governance at multiple levels. Ultimately all these frameworks are needed to inform the decisions required to deepen and connect the scattered elements of progress to date, and hence accelerate progress towards agreed goals and multiple dimensions of climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable development.</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="1.11"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">1.11</span>Knowledge Gaps </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-12-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Despite huge expansion in the literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Callaghan--2020">Callaghan et al. 2020</a>), knowledge gaps remain. Modeling still struggles to bring together detailed physical and economic climate impacts and mitigation, with limited representation of financial and distributional dynamics.

There remain gaps in understanding how international dynamics and agreements filter down to affect constituencies and local implementation. Literature on the potential for supply-side agreements, in which producers agree to restrict the supply of fossil fuels (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Asheim--2019">Asheim et al. 2019</a>) is limited but gaining increasing academic attention.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Nature is under pressure both at land and at sea, as demonstrated by declining biodiversity (IPBES 2019).

In addition to these emissions, black carbon – an aerosol that is, for example, emitted during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels – contributes to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, whilst some other short-lived pollutants temporarily cool the surface (IPCC AR6 WGI <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts on Electricity System Vulnerability" href="/chapters/chapter-6#6.5.4">Section 6.5.4</a>.3).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 1.3 | 	What is the difference between ‘net zero emissions’ and ‘carbon neutrality’?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 1.3 | What is the difference between ‘net zero emissions’ and ‘carbon neutrality’?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-28-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Annex I (Glossary) states that ‘carbon neutrality and net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions are overlapping concepts’ which ‘can be applied at the global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national)’. At the global scale the terms are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> typically applies to emissions under direct control or territorial responsibility of the entity reporting them (e.g., a country, district or sector); while carbon neutrality is also applied to firms, commodities and activities (e.g., a service or an event) and generally includes emissions and removals beyond the entity’s direct control or territorial responsibility, termed ‘Scope 3’ or ‘value chain emissions’ (Bhatia et al. 2011).</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">This means the emissions and removals that should be included are wider for ‘neutrality’ than for net zero goals, but also that offset mechanisms could be employed to help achieve neutrality through abatement beyond what is possible under the direct control of the entity. Rules and environmental integrity criteria are intended to ensure additionality and avoid double counting of offsets consistent with ‘neutrality’ claims (see ‘carbon neutrality’ and ‘offset’ in Glossary, for detail and a list of criteria).</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">While the term ‘carbon’ neutrality in this report is defined as referring specifically to CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> neutrality, use of this term in practice can be ambiguous, as some users apply it to neutrality of all GHG emissions. GHG neutrality means an entity’s gross emissions of all GHG must be balanced by the removal of an equivalent amount of CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> from the atmosphere. This requires the selection of a suitable metric that aggregates emissions from non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> gases, such as the commonly used GWP100 metric (for a discussion of GHG metrics, see AR6 WGI Box 1.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 2 in <a class="section-link" data-title="Emissions trends and drivers" href="/chapters/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> of this report).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading" id="references" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">References</span></h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-15-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Abrahamsen--2019" lang="en-GB">Abrahamsen, R., L.R.

An important factor is that many mitigation policies involve investments in low-carbon or energy-efficient technology, the savings from which persist. As a purely illustrative example: the annual increase in global emissions during 2000–2010 averaged around 1 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span>, but with large fluctuations. If policies by 2010 reduced the <span class="•-Light-CondensedItalic">annual increase</span> in that year by 100 MtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq (0.1 GtC0<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq) below what it would otherwise have been, this is hard to discern. But if these savings sustain, and in each subsequent year, policies cut another 100 MtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq off the annual increase compared to the previous year, global emissions after a decade would be around 5 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> below what they would have been without any such policies, and on average close to stabilising. However each step would be difficult to discern in the noise of annual fluctuations.</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-002"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch01.html#footnote-002-backlink">7</a> </span><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"></span>The Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) emulates the widely used Human Development Index (HDI) as they both summarise in indexes the key human development dimensions consisting of a healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living.
