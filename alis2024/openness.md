#  Openness 

The concept of "open" flourished in the 1990s and 2000s. Epitomised by the Open Knowledge Foundation [] many fields adopted the Open Definition []:
"Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).”

The semantic version of this article is OKD-Open but unfortunately many "open" systems and materials (including the PDF of this article and millions of "Open Access" articles) are not. OKD-Open can be algorithmically determined (by licence) but "Open Access" is so misused (unwittingly and deliberately) that it is semantically meaningless

## The blogosphere

The 2000's saw a blossoming of new forms of knowledge creation and dissemination, especially blogging which allowed readers to feedback additional material on the authors' sites effectively instantaneously. This allows for corrections, enhancements, aggregation, innovation and many different styles and uses. Blogs showed new types of publication such as commentary [A], collaboration, text, video, maths, chemistry, scientific findings, publication justice. See PeterMR's blog [] which included reviews and challenges to injustice.
