In this discussion, Peter Murray-Rust emphasizes the importance of regular attendance and discipline among interns, noting that this consistency is crucial for achieving quality work. He then delves into the significance of open science and semantic publication, advocating for the immediate and accessible dissemination of knowledge. He stresses the urgency of addressing climate change, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature and the need for a global, open-access approach to scientific information. The conversation touches on the challenges and progress in making scholarly publications semantic, aiming to facilitate easier reuse and broader accessibility of scientific data . The challenge lies in converting legacy information, which is often non-semantic and unstructured, into a semantic format. This process is particularly complex with PDFs, which contain only basic primitives like characters and images. Effective semantic publication requires extensive tooling and a commitment to continuous development and adaptation to changing information .
