# Suspension of GitHub account while creating a Discussion on Github

[PMR] 10:15:21 :Exactly what you did.  [Renu Kumari] 10:15:56 :So I try to create the discussion as my good having closed so I created the new discussion. In the general category. [PMR] 10:16:04 :No, was it so? What when was it 1st closed? Today? Renu Kumari] 10:16:12 :It's today. morning I tried to post the like. [PMR] 10:16:17 :So, you went to GitHub to post this into the discussion. [Renu Kumari] 10:16:23 :Of the 70 climate repository. [PMR] 10:16:27 :And. You got that screen, is that right?
[Renu Kumari] 10:16:31 :Yes. Currently it is not showing the new button, new discussion, open new discussion. [PMR] 10:16:32 :Okay. [PMR] 10:16:37 :No, but but let's try and take this. Step by step. So you took the you took a piece of text, right, which is quite large. [Renu Kumari] 10:16:51 :No, I did not took large text,  I have copied all the text in the transcript  [PMR] 10:16:57 :Yeah copied the text in the transcript, right? [PMR] 10:17:13 :You took this text, right? Okay. So it's a text file. [PMR] 10:17:21 :And. You posted that. Into an existing GitHub discussion or a new discussion. [Renu Kumari] 10:17:29 :No, it's new discussion. It's a discussion slash 12 number discussion.
[PMR] 10:17:36 :So be very, very clear. You opened a new discussion, is that right? [Renu Kumari] 10:17:43 :Yes. [PMR] 10:17:44 :What was it called? [Renu Kumari] 10:17:46 :So I give the title session1_11 June_ for formatted transcript. [Renu Kumari] 10:17:58 :That was a title and then in this. Body part like whatever it is called and then lower substance sections. [PMR] 10:17:59 :Yeah. Okay. [Renu Kumari] 10:18:07 :I base of the whole. Translate text. And submitted it. [PMR] 10:18:13 :Right. you submitted it and immediately you got this kind of  screen. Is that right? [Renu Kumari] 10:18:20 :Okay, yes. [PMR] 10:18:22 :Alright, so let's be very clear about this. You took a piece of text. Which was, a text file. [PMR] 10:18:31 :Which we had, created together. As a community, you posted it into a new discussion on GitHub and immediately, your account was suspended. [Renu Kumari] 10:18:37 :Yes. [Renu Kumari] 10:18:45 :Hmm. They got me this messages. What was that? This message is about account being suspended. [Renu Kumari] 10:18:52 :Access to your account has been suspended due to violation of our terms of services. So I. Then I click on the contact support. [Renu Kumari] 10:19:25 :And then I found from the internet, the support.email, like from chat, GPT. [Renu Kumari] 10:19:27 :I go to support@github.com. [PMR] 10:19:30 :Yes. And when did you mail them? [Renu Kumari] 10:19:35 :I mailed today morning. [PMR] 10:19:42 :Yes. Okay, you've done exactly right. What I would say is, The. Clear and more structured your mail to them is. [Renu Kumari] 10:20:07 :Okay. [PMR] 10:20:08 :Okay. So 1st of all, It's traumatic when something like this happens. [PMR] 10:20:19 :You're behaving responsibly. And you are accused of malpractice. And I don't believe that you could possibly have done anything which merits Malpractice. [Renu Kumari] 10:20:25 :Hmm.
# Peter's Hypothetical Assumptions about banning the Account
[PMR] 10:20:31 :I'm going to hypothesize now. The possible hypotheses are A that they thought this was serious copyright violation. [Renu Kumari] 10:20:50 :Yes. [PMR] 10:20:51 :{1}There is no, there is no copyright violation because it's actually, my speech and unless They have actually felt that it was inappropriate for you to publish this. [PMR] 10:21:03 :Which is possible. Then, I don't think it's copyright very nice. [Renu Kumari] 10:21:03 :Yes. [PMR] 10:21:16 :We did not quote anybody in this. There is nothing where they can say you have violated, Disney's copyright or whomever it might be. [Renu Kumari] 10:21:26 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:21:26 :{2} the second possibility is it contains dialogue. Which is unacceptable to, the GitHub principles. [PMR] 10:21:41 :Now, we have not discussed anything, I believe, which is inappropriate. We should Look through. [PMR] 10:21:51 :And one of the difficult things, where machines fail, is that if you are talking about something, then the machine may mistake it. [PMR] 10:22:05 :So if it's reported dialogue. Then you know it is possible, that it's not regarded as reported dialogue but as actual dialogue. [PMR] 10:22:18 :So if I. For example, quote somebody. As coming up with something which is. [PMR] 10:22:29 :Unacceptable for all sorts of reasons whether it might be hate speech or sexual inappropriateness or whatever, then It's. [PMR] 10:22:43 :And this is frequent. This is one reason why automated filters are a very bad idea. [PMR] 10:22:50 :Because people cannot design automatic filters which are as good as humans, right? So it's possible that something in the content upset them. [PMR] 10:23:02 :{3}The 3rd is that it might violate some practice which was not allowed so it could be that it was too big or it was too frequent. [PMR] 10:23:19 :Or that there was an intention. To. An intention to, in some way. [PMR] 10:23:31 :Cause problems to the site. So, you know, might be seen as a denial of service attack or something of that sort. [PMR] 10:23:42 :So all of these are possibilities. Too big, too frequent. something of that sort. [PMR] 10:23:53 :{4} Then it's a possibility that your email has been confused with somebody else. Right. Okay.

# Discussing the solution
[PMR] 10:24:02 :Do you have more than one GitHub account? [Renu Kumari] 10:24:05 :No, I have only one but I created another one today. [PMR] 10:24:10 :Right. Okay. That's what did they do about that? [Renu Kumari] 10:24:19 : another invite is with the semantic climate and one is with my, personal account like the email account. [PMR] 10:24:26 :Right, so you've got a personal one. Have you had any response from GitHub on that? [Renu Kumari] 10:24:32 :Yes, on the 1st one, the personal one, which I was using earlier. So they sent me the ticket ID for the complaint ticket number. [PMR] 10:24:42 :Oh, you've got a ticket number. Okay, can you show us this ticket number? [Renu Kumari] 10:24:44 :Yes. [Renu Kumari] 10:24:50 :Yes, I can share it. [PMR] 10:26:17 :Right, it may be worth [PMR] 10:26:24 :Yes, it It may, now 1st will renew. I think you should not do any of this because you don't want to be. [PMR] 10:26:36 :Cut off github again and you don't want the automated system to think that you know you are in some way an irresponsible user right okay I'm also a little bit, [Renu Kumari] 10:26:47 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:26:53 :Reluctant to do it myself because All of our code is in my repositories. And if they ban me. [Renu Kumari] 10:27:00 :And the website is also we are running the semantic climate website whatever we are updating it through the [PMR] 10:27:01 :Then we've got [PMR] 10:27:08 :Yes. So.
[PMR] 10:27:13 :Have they banned the semantic climate site then? [Renu Kumari] 10:27:19 :No. [PMR] 10:27:20 :They banned, flower, whatever, but not semantic climate, right? [Renu Kumari] 10:27:28 :There's, there's no data ID for the semantic climate. I think the website, yes. [PMR] 10:27:31 :There isn't. Okay, fine. [PMR] 10:27:39 :So you'll see that I am. 1st of all, I'm not panicking, right? [Renu Kumari] 10:27:47 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:27:48 :Secondly I'm giving you reassurance. [Renu Kumari] 10:27:51 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:27:52 :Right, so you've done nothing wrong. you may have, [PMR] 10:28:02 :Overstep something. Without. You know, totally accidentally or it may be that they're software, has inappropriateately banned you. [Renu Kumari] 10:28:14 :So now what the other people will do with the are they going to do this? Both the sense, other things like similar to our what should they avoid. [Renu Kumari] 10:28:23 :To profit not facing the situations again. [PMR] 10:28:27 :Well. 1st of all, [PMR] 10:28:35 :So I'm thinking. I will ask my associates about this because they will know this, right? [Renu Kumari] 10:28:44 :Hmm [PMR] 10:28:45 :And. We have. [PMR] 10:28:51 :We should be careful what we post to GitHub. Because we don't want to get cut off. [Renu Kumari] 10:28:54 :Hmm.
# Reading the content made available on slack for re-examine of content

[PMR] 10:28:59 :let me read to the content quickly. [Renu Kumari] 10:29:08 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:29:11 :Is the content on Slack? [Renu Kumari] 10:29:12 :Yes. [PMR] 10:29:14 :Right, okay. So, [PMR] 10:29:22 :Let me go to our slack. This is, you know, absolutely. Textbook illustration as to  my knowledge. [Renu Kumari] 10:29:25 :Thank you. [PMR] 10:29:34  :so is it in coordination, is that right? [Renu Kumari] 10:29:35 :So maybe copyright issue. Copyright issue may be there [Renu Kumari] 10:29:45 :Yes. [PMR] 10:29:48 :Right. [PMR] 10:29:52 :Is it this one?  [Renu Kumari] 10:29:55 :You can share the screen. [Renu Kumari] 10:29:58 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:30:36 :I think I have no option but I'm going to read it here. [Renu Kumari] 10:30:39 :You can download this. [PMR] 10:31:16 :Right, this isn't today's monologue, it's yesterday's, is that right? [Renu Kumari] 10:31:21 :It's from the 11th June  [PMR] 10:33:09 :Right. That's the complete thing. 71 lines, is that right? [Renu Kumari] 10:33:15 :Yes. [PMR] 10:33:18 :Oh, it's just truncated for display. [PMR] 10:33:27 :No, it's the same links, okay. So. Reno, I can't see anything in that which would trigger some violation of the guidelines. [Renu Kumari] 10:33:28 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:33:52 :I'm trying to get through my mind as to why somebody's account would be closed. [PMR] 10:34:01 :Another one is and National security, So if You are from. [PMR] 10:34:10 :The certain countries which are called the axis of evil by the united states and they are Iran, North Korea, Cuba and some where else I forget. [PMR] 10:34:22 :If you are from any of those places, then, If you post things, they may be seen as of, a violation. [PMR] 10:34:34 :A violation of security. These countries are not allowed to use US software, for example. But I don't think there's anything in that. [Renu Kumari] 10:34:41 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:34:46 :And I don't think you're, you know, you're likely to be, [PMR] 10:34:52 :Identified.
# Writing a descriptive email to support.github

[Renu Kumari] 10:34:55 :So I have to write it in a descriptive email to them. What is step by step? So what I wanted to do and what I did and what I got it. [PMR] 10:34:59 :Absolutely. [Renu Kumari] 10:35:05 :That is the reason. Yeah, I'll do this. [PMR] 10:35:06 :Yes. You don't need to take more than a line or 2 about it. Just we will do this together. [Renu Kumari] 10:35:12 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:35:15 :So, okay, let's, dictate this. [PMR] 10:35:24 :So [PMR] 10:35:28 :I am manager of a community projects run between the UK and india make that  where we collect How public knowledge and make it semantic. [PMR] 10:35:47 :We use GitHub both for our code. And for documents. [PMR] 10:35:56 :Our documents are created by us. And we will How, these will publish under  [PMR] 10:36:09 :Okay, under an open license, allowing, a redistribution, there is no known copyright violation in what we do. [PMR] 10:36:22 :We do not include, any, unacceptable language such as No. [PMR] 10:37:47 :We Do not believe we have violated any terms and conditions of GitHub. And we asked to be. [PMR] 10:37:58 :Reconnected immediately. And Assured that this will not happen again. [PMR] 10:38:07 :I think that's probably good enough. Okay. Draft it out. [Renu Kumari] 10:38:10 :Yes. [PMR] 10:38:18  :then come to me and I will also sign it. [Renu Kumari] 10:38:22 :Okay.  [PMR] 10:38:28 :Good. Have you mailed their support? [Renu Kumari] 10:38:33 :We had just. Yes. [PMR] 10:38:34 :You've got a ticket. What did you put on your ticket? [Renu Kumari] 10:38:39 :I have to reinstate the word was there in the. [Renu Kumari] 10:38:45 :Okay, Yes. Hmm. Yes, we are that we I am Renu Kumari and this my account has been suspended today. [PMR] 10:38:46 :You ask for reinstatement. That's good. Was it just a single sentence? [PMR] 10:38:57 :Yep. That's an excellent message. Okay, I would probably, since you've said that and it's very clear. [Renu Kumari] 10:38:57 :So please reinstate this account. [PMR] 10:39:10 :And you might have been, suspended for some other reason. We don't know. [Renu Kumari] 10:39:16 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:39:17 :So it's, it's probably not a good idea. To send anything more. On that ticket. [Renu Kumari] 10:39:21 :Yes, because, I send, another email that, another account I created and then, Maybe it is capturing our IP address or whatever it is the same browser. [Renu Kumari] 10:39:34 :So, do you mean saying that this is a duplicate, complaint? [Renu Kumari] 10:39:43 :So they are not raised any other ticket. [PMR] 10:39:43 :Right. Right, so you've. So this will probably, the ticket will only be with one account, I would think. [Renu Kumari] 10:39:54 :Yes, one account. [PMR] 10:39:56 :Is it with the flower account? [Renu Kumari] 10:39:58 :Yes, this is for the flower. But I don't know how they capture the same information. [PMR] 10:40:00 :Okay, continue on that. We'll see what happens. [Renu Kumari] 10:40:05  :Yeah, maybe we'll wait for a 1 day and then after that time. Hmm. [PMR] 10:40:07 :I think you've got to wait. they do say that they are, understaffed at the moment. [Renu Kumari] 10:40:16 :Hmm. [Renu Kumari] 10:40:21 :We will wait and then reply more from on Monday. Maybe I'll do Monday with reference to the ticket. [PMR] 10:40:25 :I think that's a good idea. Now, Is this somebody here? [Renu Kumari] 10:40:29 :Okay.
# Seeking someone from the interns to volunteer to do it

[PMR] 10:40:35 :So I've said why I don't want to do it. Could somebody else volunteer, to post this to a discussion and see whether it's the content that is the problem or whether it's the use as the problem. [Renu Kumari] 10:40:49 :So their account will be banned, So how they are going to handle it. [PMR] 10:40:58 :No, what I mean is flower has been suspended and your prior, your other accounts has been suspended. [PMR] 10:41:16 :Right, okay. So. We're really looking for a volunteer. [PMR] 10:41:29 :To carry this out. I'm also thinking about whether we should move this. [Renu Kumari] 10:41:40 :We should wait. I think we should wait and then because other accounts will be seized again and then. They have to replace the problem. [Renu Kumari] 10:41:48 :Because we are working on the Yeah.
# Moving to GitLab instead

[PMR] 10:41:51 :Yes. We may need to move ,[PMR] 10:42:02 :We may need to move to get lab. Gitlab is much smaller, [PMR] 10:42:12 :It's open. [PMR] 10:42:19 :It's run by, a Mega Corporation. [Renu Kumari] 10:42:24 :I thought it is not open. Okay. [PMR] 10:42:25 :No, the contents are Open. But not this software and not the control. [Renu Kumari] 10:42:37 Okay, then we can move on.
# How we create the Paper
[PMR] 10:45:08 :Talk about how we create the paper because this is actually describing this process. So, here we go, section. [Renu Kumari] 10:45:14 :Hmm. [PMR] 10:45:18 :How we created this paper. This paper consists of, Many hundreds of pages of. [PMR] 10:45:30 :Text data software and other material. It's primarily stored on the GitHub repository. [PMR] 10:45:43 :And to Right an account of it, we have used a number of free but not open tools to create it. [PMR] 10:46:23 :And we also, save the results in the slack system. Which also have a transcriber. [PMR] 10:46:31 :So the 1st step. Is to record our. Audio. And where necessary video session. [PMR] 10:46:41 :And we plan to make this, open notebook available for everybody. We then, take the transcript or transcription created by the automatic system. [PMR] 10:46:56 :The and, make those available. And post those, particularly on GitHub discussions. [PMR] 10:47:06 :Which is which allows for posting and commenting by all members of the GitHub community. [PMR] 10:47:17 :We then, take that text And convert it into a summary. Because it's it contains quite a lot of colloquialisms and, Start stops as part of the, monologue, creation process. [PMR] 10:47:41 :And we turn that into a rough. Transcript, of, the material. And then we are experimenting with summarization to turn it into a concise summary of the process using the [PMR] 10:48:05 :Open source tools such as hugging face to make a summary. Finally, we craft the Translation and summarization, there's transcription and summarization into the final PDF. [PMR] 10:48:23 :Chapter or section for the alias article that we are authoring. [PMR] 10:48:32 :That article is not a static article. It's an HTML document which can change day by day. [PMR] 10:48:42 :Both after the submission of the, alice article for PDF rendering, and, well. [PMR] 10:48:56 :Remain as a limit living document for all time. So although the PDF is a static snapshot of the article, the crew article is a living HTML, Don't, which can be read by the whole world, which can be, commented on using whatever system it's published in, such as, at the moment. [PMR] 10:49:27 :GitHub, which allows discussion comments. And so forth. [PMR] 10:49:37 :We will annotate. The HTML version, with our dictionaries, we will apply doc analysis to come up with the most important terms in that and to link it into entity recognition. [PMR] 10:49:56 :And we will also use our own dictionaries to annotate the text and publish those annotations as a growing work. [PMR] 10:50:07 :Which will have no fixed end date. The growing work will be strictly versioned. Because the tools we use allow and therefore it will be possible to observe what this document was at any time. [PMR] 10:50:25 :So we would see this as an extension. Of, Ranganson's final 5th law, which was that the library is a growing organism. [PMR] 10:50:41 :We would say that knowledge documents are a continuously growing.
