In this session we discussed on
## History of Semantification and Open Notebook Science
**Origins and Memex** : Vannevar Bush's 1945 concept of the Memex envisioned a device storing all books, records, and communications.
**Library Catalogs** : These systems influenced faceted classification methods and the idea of capturing all research data efficiently.
**Open Notebook Science:**  Pioneered by Jean Claude Bradley, this practice involves making primary research records publicly available online as they are recorded. It promotes transparency and collaboration but faces challenges due to existing academic cultures and lack of tools.

## Problems with Current Publication Methods
**Static Publication** : Traditional methods involve transcribing data into papers, often losing dynamic, day-to-day research details.
**Need for Semantics** : Current publications do not capture the full dynamic range of research activities.

## Creating Semantic Information
**Tools and Practices** : Utilizing GitHub for software uploads, following the ethos of the Human Genome Project's Bermuda Protocol.
**Challenges** : Publishers focus on metrics, which do not support open notebook science.

## IPCC Glossaries and Reports
**Glossary Usage** : Essential for understanding and marking up terms in reports. Multiple glossaries are combined to create a comprehensive, searchable resource.
**Acronyms and Terms** : Collecting acronyms and terms from various reports to enhance searchability and semantic meaning.

## IPCC Chapters and Semantic Structuring
**HTML Conversion** : Converting PDF chapters to HTML using headless browsers to facilitate better navigation and semantic labeling.
**Figures and Captions** : Emphasizing the importance of figure captions and internal links for easy navigation.

## Software and Libraries
**AmyLib and AmiClimate** : Modular software libraries for document analysis, classification, and semantification. Includes tools for handling bibliographies, CSVs, dictionaries, HTML, NLP, and PDF conversion.
**Testing** : Extensive test suites ensure functionality and robustness.
Research Tools
**`pygetpapers`** : Updated tool for searching and retrieving climate literature.
**`docanalysis`** : A repository for analyzing and processing documents.
