* ##Summary
In this session Renu Kumari explained that her GitHub account was suspended while she was creating a new discussion in the semantic climate repository. She was posting a formatted transcript when she received the suspension notification. They speculated on the possible reasons for the suspension and promptly wrote a detailed email to GitHub support. Expecting a delayed response, they considered alternatives like having an intern attempt the same task (volunteering) or moving to GitLab. Later on, Peter (PMR) conducted a session on creating papers, which involved drafting text, summarizing extensive transcripts, and converting them into concise summaries using open-source tools. They discussed publishing these documents as living, versioned HTML files on GitHub, allowing continuous updates, annotations, and public engagement.
