The study introduces deep learning and designs a Chinese word sense disambiguation model based on the fusion of the Transformer with the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism of Transformer and the sequence modeling capability of BiLSTM, this model efficiently captures semantic information and context relationships in Chinese sentences, leading to accurate word sense disambiguation. The model's evaluation is conducted using the PKU Paraphrase Bank, a Chinese text paraphrase dataset. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a precision rate of 83.71% in Chinese word sense disambiguation, significantly outperforming the Long Short-Term Memory algorithm. Additionally, the root mean squared error of this algorithm is less than 17, with a loss function value remaining around 0.14. Thus, this study validates that the constructed Transformer-fused BiLSTM-based Chinese word sense disambiguation model algorithm exhibits both high accuracy and robustness in identifying word senses in the Chinese language. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for advancing the intelligent development of word senses in Chinese language applications.", "affiliation": "The College of Literature and Journalism, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610000, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Chinese Language", "Word Sense Disambiguation", "Root Mean Squared Error", "Bilstm", "Transformer Model Algorithm"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56976-5"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10943221"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10943221?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-03-16", "firstIndexDate": "2024-03-17", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-03-19", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-18", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-03-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-03-15"}
