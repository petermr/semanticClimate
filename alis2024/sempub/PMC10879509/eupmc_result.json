While there is ample evidence that processing associated with task execution changes with practice, such evidence regarding cue-induced task preparation is scarce. Here we explored practice-related changes of processing pathways by task cuing in order to assess the plasticity of task preparation. We first developed and validated a new method for the study of practice-related changes, the effect course analysis. The effect course analysis is a model-free, non-parametric method designed to reveal effect changes within an experimental session on a continuous time scale. Then we applied this method to a new study in which cued task sets were supposed to remain activated during assessment of task-relevant pathways, as potential task execution was postponed at the end of the trial. The results showed that, with little practice, task cuing amplified task-relevant pathways, whereas this effect vanished with practice, suggesting that practice prompts fundamental changes of how task cues are used for task preparation. Hence, if one cannot be certain that cognitive processing is stationary, investigating the time course of experimental effects appears to be crucial to determine how cognitive processing is influenced by practice.", "affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Section for Cognitive Electrophysiology, Ulm University, Leimgrubenweg 12, 89075, Ulm, Germany. alexander.berger@uni-ulm.de.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"agency": "Universit\u00e4t Ulm", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "DFG KI 804/8-1", "agency": "Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Cues"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Psychomotor Performance"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Reaction Time", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "PH", "qualifierName": "physiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54823-1.pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-54823-1"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10879509"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10879509?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-02-22", "dateOfCreation": "2024-02-20", "firstIndexDate": "2024-02-21", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-02-23", "dateOfRevision": "2024-02-24", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-02-21", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-02-21"}
