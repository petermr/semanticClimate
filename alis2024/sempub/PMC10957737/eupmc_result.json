This study examines the factors influencing public participation behavior on government microblogs in these megacities during the pandemic. It guides megacities in disseminating epidemic information, promoting knowledge on epidemic prevention, managing public opinion, and addressing related matters.<h4>Methods</h4>Utilizing the elaboration likelihood model's central and peripheral routes, drawing on an empirical analysis of 6,677 epidemic-related microblogs from seven Chinese megacities, this study analyses the influence mechanisms influencing public participation behavior and reveals the regulatory role of confirmed case numbers. Meanwhile,a qualitative comparative analysis examines and discusses diferent confgurations of ixn fuential factors.<h4>Results</h4>The study reveals that microblog content richness demonstrates a U-shaped impact on public participation behavior. Conversely, content interaction, content length, and the number of fans positively impact participation, while update frequency has a negative impact. Additionally, the number of new confrmed cases positively regulates the impact of microblog content and publisher characteristics on public participation behavior. Public participation behavior also varies based on publishing time and content semantic features. This study further revealed the different confgurations of influential factors by QCA method.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study reveals the impact mechanism of the microblog content and publisher characteristics on public participation behavior. It also demonstrates the regulatory role of newly confrmed cases in the way content and publishers' characteristics influence public participation behavior. This study is of great significance for the operation of government microblogs, the release of emergency information, and the promotion of public participation.", "affiliation": "School of Management, Xi'an Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Government"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pandemics", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "PC", "qualifierName": "prevention & control", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Community Participation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "EP", "qualifierName": "epidemiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Public Participation", "Megacity", "Covid-19", "Confirmed Cases", "Government Microblog"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1337107/pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1337107"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10957737"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10957737?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-03-26", "dateOfCreation": "2024-03-25", "firstIndexDate": "2024-03-25", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-03-25", "dateOfRevision": "2024-05-10", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-03-08", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-03-08"}
