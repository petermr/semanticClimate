Continuous dust emission from the road surfaces is detrimental to the road itself and the road users. Due to this, multiple dust monitoring and control techniques are currently adopted in the world. The current dust monitoring methods require expensive equipment and expertise. This study introduces a novel pragmatic and robust approach to quantifying traffic-induced road dust using a deep learning method called semantic segmentation. Based on the authors' previous works, the best-performing semantic segmentation machine learning models were selected and used to identify dust in an image pixel-wise. The total number of dust pixels was then correlated with real-world dust measurements obtained from a research-grade dust monitor. Our method shows that semantic segmentation can be adopted to quantify traffic-induced dust reasonably. Over 90% of the predictions from both correlations fall in true positive quadrant, indicating that when dust concentrations are below the threshold, the segmentation can accurately predict them. The results were validated and extended for real-time application.
