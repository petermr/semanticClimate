We defined the dimensions and related features to include in the maturity model by analysing the current literature and existing catalogues of semantic artefacts provided by experts. In addition, we assessed 26 different catalogues to demonstrate the effectiveness of the maturity model, which includes 12 different dimensions (Metadata, Openness, Quality, Availability, Statistics, PID, Governance, Community, Sustainability, Technology, Transparency, and Assessment) and 43 related features (or sub-criteria) associated with these dimensions. Such a maturity model is one of the first attempts to provide recommendations for governance and processes for preserving and maintaining semantic artefacts and helps assess/address interoperability challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Research data</kwd><kwd>Computer science</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101017452</award-id><award-id>101095129</award-id><award-id>101057344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonquet</surname><given-names>Clement</given-names></name><name><surname>Peroni</surname><given-names>Silvio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Data Repository Platform project of the E&#x000f6;tv&#x000f6;s Lor&#x000e1;nd Research Network (ELKH ARP)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the advent of Open Data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, the Open Science movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and the FAIR Principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> in the scholarly ecosystem, the role and need for storing, managing and sharing data grew significantly in academia. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been an essential step in European data management in recent years. At least initially, the GDPR was the main responsible for scientists&#x02019; fears of making their work impossible as data scientists. Indeed, one of the reasons for the introduction of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) has been to provide a safe European environment for data management compliant with the GDPR, to avoid the risk of European scientists starting to entrust all their data to foreign-owned/registered data servers to bypass European laws<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In the EOSC, strategic relevance has been given (since the beginning) to address issues with implementing real interoperability among all the infrastructures, services and data researchers share in this ecosystem. Indeed, one of the most cited and used documents produced in projects implementing the EOSC is the EOSC Interoperability Framework, a report of the Interoperability Task Force of the EOSC Executive Board FAIR Working Group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This report aimed to identify &#x0201c;the general principles that should drive the creation of the EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF), and organises them into the four layers [...]: technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In this framework, the objects that are referred to as the key components to enable the implementation of semantic interoperability are named <italic>semantic artefacts</italic>.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>A definition for semantic artefact</title><p id="Par4">Previous studies used terms such as <italic>Knowledge Organization Systems</italic> (KOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> or knowledge artefact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> to address semantic artefacts. A KOS has been adopted as a general term to encompass all schemes used to organise information and promote knowledge management, such as classification schemes, gazetteers, lexical databases, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies. These KOSs aim to underline the semantic structure of a domain, which needs to be embodied as web services to facilitate resource discovery and retrieval for either humans or machines.</p><p id="Par5">Other recent works defined the expression <italic>semantic artefact</italic> as a machine-actionable and machine-readable formalisation of a conceptualisation enabling sharing and reuse by humans and machines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Semantic artefacts may have a broad range of formalisation, which include ontologies, terminologies, taxonomies, thesauri, vocabularies, metadata schemas, and standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Semantic artefact was also strongly advised as an overarching term in the H2020 FAIRsFAIR project&#x02019;s &#x0201c;FAIR semantics&#x0201d; task. Despite the different forms of a semantic artefact, some works used blanket terms such as &#x0201c;ontologies&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;vocabularies and ontologies&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, semantic artefacts are serialised using various digital representation formats, e.g. RDF or OWL using XML, Turtle and JSON-LD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In the context of this article, we define a <italic>semantic artefact</italic> as a machine-actionable formalisation (represented using appropriate formats and serialisations, including RDF and non-RDF standards) of a conceptualisation, enabling sharing and reuse by humans and machines. According to David <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, &#x0201c;machine-actionability&#x0201d; is defined as the property belonging to a type for which operations have been specified in a symbolic grammar. This entails that a machine-actionable definition is also machine-interpretable, i.e., can be related to semantic artefacts in a given context and, therefore, has a defined purpose, and machine-readable, i.e., is clearly defined by structural specifications. Semantic artefacts may have a wide range of formalisations, from loose sets of terms, taxonomies, thesauri, (meta)data schemas, term mappings, and schema crosswalks to higher-order logic constructs, vocabularies, and ontologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Where semantic artefacts are preserved</title><p id="Par7">Often, these semantic artefacts are stored and shared using specific services called registries, libraries, repositories, catalogues, or terminology/vocabulary servers. Each provides a mixture of functionality &#x02014; ranging from simple metadata descriptions to advanced content-based services &#x02014; to facilitate finding, accessing, understanding and re-using of such semantic artefacts and enabling their long-term preservation.</p><p id="Par8">The notion of <italic>ontology library</italic> was introduced in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, defined as &#x0201c;A library system that offers various functions for managing, adapting and standardizing groups of ontologies&#x0201d;. In addition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, highlighted the importance of making such libraries easily accessible and offering efficient support for re-using existing relevant ontologies and standardizing them based on upper-level ontologies and ontology representation languages.</p><p id="Par9">The terms &#x0201c;collection&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;listing&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;registry&#x0201d; are also used to describe ontology libraries. All correspond to systems that help reuse or find ontologies by simply listing them (e.g., DAML or DERI listings) or offering structured metadata to describe them (e.g., FAIRSharing, BARTOC, Agrisemantics Map). Yet, those systems do not support additional services beyond the description of the items, e.g., a content analysis of the ontologies or a search index on the ontology content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A new concept introduced by Hartmann <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> to cover these aspects is an <italic>ontology repository</italic> with advanced features that enable searching, browsing, managing metadata, customizing, and mapping an application to query the contents of the ontologies. D&#x02019;Aquin and Noy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and Naskar and Dutta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> provide the latest reviews of ontology repositories.</p><p id="Par10">By the end of the 2000s, the topic was of high interest as illustrated by the 2010 ORES workshop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or the 2008 Ontology Summit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/wiki/OntologySummit2008">http://ontolog.cim3.net/wiki/OntologySummit2008</ext-link>). The Open Ontology Repository Initiative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> aimed to create a joint infrastructure of ontology repositories through collaboration. At the time, the initiative utilized the NCBO BioPortal technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which was the most advanced open-source technology for ontology management. Still, it was not yet available as a &#x0201c;virtual appliance&#x0201d; as it is today. Later, the initiative considered using the OntoHub<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> technology for broader application, but it has since been discontinued.</p><p id="Par11">Other recent works used to refer to a catalogue (that may or may not contain semantic artefacts) with terms such as &#x0201c;repository&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and &#x0201c;registry&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as well as hypernyms such as &#x0201c;infrastructure&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;service&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, the FAIRsFAIR project employed the term &#x0201c;semantic registry&#x0201d;, which is defined as a &#x0201c;catalogue that contains metadata about semantic artefacts&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">While talking about catalogues, two other works provide relevant insights.

Instead, Lin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> introduce the concept of <italic>trustworthy digital repositories</italic> and provide an operational definition for them &#x0201c;with a clear remit to actively preserve data in response to changes in both technology and stakeholder requirements&#x0201d;. Instead, the only works referring explicitly to semantic artefacts as the items contained in the catalogue are by Corcho <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and, more recently, Jonquet <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Considering the status we have presented, there is a clear need to adopt an inclusive definition that, in principle, enables us to consider as a catalogue also web pages (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://w3id.org/mobility">https://w3id.org/mobility</ext-link>) with descriptive metadata of the semantic artefacts included in the catalogue in human-readable form.

These TFs have been grouped into four macro topics:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par15"><italic>Metadata and data quality</italic> - focussed on providing guidelines and tools for the discoverability, understanding, and reusability of research objects, and aiming at developing models and benchmarks to assess the data FAIRness and quality;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16"><italic>Research careers and curricula</italic> - dedicated to identifying the characteristics of the main stakeholders involved in the EOSC, i.e. researchers and data stewards, and possible rewarding systems to promote Open Science practices within the EOSC;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17"><italic>Technical challenges</italic> - directed at proposing approaches to foster authentication and authorisation procedures, augment the quality and FAIR-compliancy of research software, data and services, and their long-term preservation;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18"><italic>Sustaining EOSC</italic> - finalised at producing proposals for long-term financial sustainability of the EOSC and the monitoring of the TFs.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par19">The first macro topic resonates with three distinct dimensions (each implemented through a different TF).

The charter of this task force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and the subsequent working activities held in this context have concerned several aspects of semantic interoperability, including the identification of <italic>Semantic Interoperability Profiles</italic> (SIPs, i.e. the list of resources used to address a specific semantic interoperability case study as defined by a community), mappings and crosswalks (for establishing relationships between elements in different models to achieve interoperability and data exchange), and the management and sharing of the primary tool for enabling semantic interoperability, i.e. semantic artefacts.</p><p id="Par21">The work we describe in this article contributes to the ongoing effort by the EOSC Task Force on Semantic Interoperability to address interoperability challenges towards the vision of building the EOSC, as a Europe-wide shared data infrastructure based on the FAIR ecosystem of data and services. In particular, our work addresses the need to identify dimensions to assess the <italic>maturity</italic> of catalogues of semantic artefacts. Catalogues are the critical system that enables and maximises the availability and discoverability of the semantic artefacts, thus acting as a keyholder and crucial component for implementing semantic interoperability.</p><p id="Par22">Understanding the maturity of such catalogues is a crucial aspect to consider for envisioning how to enable and improve the long-term preservation of the semantic artefacts that permit semantic interoperability of systems. Indeed, a maturity model for assessing such catalogues would provide recommendations for governance and processes for preserving and maintaining semantic artefacts and help assess/address interoperability challenges. Additionally, improving these catalogues might help to enhance the data research life-cycle and other tools made available by research infrastructures. For example, the research infrastructure may warn the researcher about a new version of a semantic artefact, and help her find relevant mappings and adapt the research to the new version. Finally, the recent workshop organized by the Horizon Europe project FAIR-IMPACT on the governance of semantic artefacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> has shown the importance of catalogues in the different governance models for semantic artefacts.</p><p id="Par23">This article presents the outcomes of an extensive analysis done by a group within the EOSC Task Force on Semantic Interoperability aiming at answering the following research question:</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Which dimensions and features can be used to assess the maturity of catalogues of semantic artefacts?</title><p id="Par24">To answer this research question, we have gathered various definitions concerning catalogues storing and serving semantic artefacts (either at the metadata or data/content level or both).

These dimensions facilitate the categorization of catalogues and the evaluation of their maturity. In addition, we analysed a collection of 26 semantic artefacts catalogues, aiming, on the one hand, at completing the maturity model by adding additional features (or sub-criteria) for each of the dimensions identified and, on the other hand, at showing how existing catalogues comply with such dimensions and sub-criteria. These features serve as a specification of different levels of compliance of a catalogue against the related dimension and provide a categorical view to assess the maturity of catalogues of semantic artefacts.</p><p id="Par25">The target audience of our work and the maturity model presented here refers to at least the following users:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par26">Semantic artefact <italic>providers</italic> may benefit from the model by understanding the criteria that make their artefacts more discoverable and usable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27"><italic>Users</italic> of semantic artefacts can leverage the maturity model to assess and compare different catalogues, gaining insights into the reliability and relevance of the offered artefacts.

Understanding the criteria critical to users helps developers prioritise features and improvements that enhance the user experience and overall utility of the catalogue, ensuring they meet the criteria that users find valuable. This also enables developers to identify areas for continuous improvement in their catalogues through regular evaluation and benchmarking against industry standards and user expectations. This ensures they stay competitive and deliver a valuable resource for semantic artefact providers and users. Furthermore, this allows developers to communicate the strengths of their catalogues better to stakeholders, providers, and users, thus fostering trust and engagement.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par29">The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

catalogues listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> are not the same type of system. Indeed, some are ontology lookup services/repositories (e.g. AgroPortal and the EBI Ontology Lookup Service), while others are wider registries of standards/databases/policies (e.g., FAIRsharing) that include, but are not limited to, ontologies or other semantic artefacts. As such, their original intended scope and functionalities are inevitably different. However, according to the definition provided in this work, they all fall within the concept of catalogues of semantic artefacts.</p><p id="Par117">The raw data of Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> are available online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par118">This section contains an analysis of the maturity dimensions based on the assessment results outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Maturity dimensions are examined in the order they appear in the table to summarize the current status of implementation regarding each category.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Metadata (Me)</title><p id="Par119">Adopting standard vocabulary for metadata is an essential aspect of joining, comparing, and curating semantic artefacts. In addition, it fosters the interoperability of these items. Yet, only 19% (5) use standard vocabularies. Further analysis is needed to confirm that all the other catalogues do not use standard vocabularies. Indeed, these catalogues may use custom vocabularies made by extending standard vocabularies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Openness (Op) and Quality (Qu)</title><p id="Par120">All the catalogues maintained by a community with members from different organizations/infrastructures (5 out of 26) are based on open-source tools and provide no authentication methods/restrictions to their contents. Furthermore, catalogues that enable external/registered users to add/propose new semantic artefacts to include in the catalogue (65%) delegate the quality control of these changes to the maintainers/curators of the artefacts. Indeed, generally, more than half of the analysed catalogues (65%) permit the curation of their data by either the owners of the catalogue or the maintainers of the semantic artefacts. No catalogue provides both strategies. This aspect is a positive sign, which shows that most of the catalogues are concerned with guaranteeing a good quality of their data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Availability (Av) and PID (Pi)</title><p id="Par121">All catalogues, with only one exception, provide access with no restriction. However, 8 (i.e., around 31%) include functionalities, mostly APIs, accessible only to registered users. Only a tiny percentage of catalogues (i.e., 11.5%) use PIDs for identifying resources. At the same time, a more significant number of catalogues (i.e., 30.8%) provide a PID for the metadata of a given record. They are typically used to represent the creator, the contributor or for more specific aspects, e.g., the URI of imported ontologies. In only one case, the catalogue provides PIDs for both the identification of resources and their metadata; most of the time, the catalogues do not assume the role of assigning and managing PIDs to their resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistics (St)</title><p id="Par122">Half of the catalogues provide resource statistics, typically including the number of classes, properties and axioms included in their semantic artefacts. Most of these last (corresponding to around 35% of the total) also provide general statistics that aggregate information across all resources. In a few cases, social statistics are enabled by the catalogue or included from another source, e.g., in the form of metrics taken from GitHub metadata where the original resources are stored (e.g., number of received stars and contributors).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Governance (Go) and Community (Co)</title><p id="Par123">Governance processes and/or structure are described by over half of the catalogues, 73% of which explicitly provide rules for contributors willing to propose new resources. In 7 cases, external 3rd-party solutions, particularly GitHub, are used as resource management tools. Some of the catalogues are more open to the community&#x02019;s contribution than others. In particular, while almost one-third only provide the capabilities to communicate with the catalogue through read-only APIs, only 8 out of 26 also provide the possibility for resource creation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Sustainability (Su)</title><p id="Par124">In 2 cases, the sustainability could not be assessed. In the remaining catalogues, the sustainability seems sufficiently stable since they are maintained by at least one organization, community, or management board. Furthermore, six of them are also supported by research projects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Technology (Te)</title><p id="Par125">Most catalogues (92%) provide at least a web search GUI. The non-SPARQL catalogues represent 61% (16) of the total; around 88% of these use a web search GUI, and 56% combine it with REST APIs. Therefore, only 10 out of 26 provide a SPARQL endpoint. 70% of these provide machine-readable metadata. Overall, the preferred technology used by all the catalogues integrating machine-readable metadata is either REST APIs, web search GUI, or both. Many catalogues incorporate all three technologies (30%), i.e. REST API, web search GUI, and SPARQL endpoint, especially the catalogues based on the OntoPortal software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These catalogues provide data with no authentications/restrictions, and contents are freely available without restrictions. In addition, for most of them, external/registered users can add/propose new semantic artefacts to be included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Transparency (Tr)</title><p id="Par126">Only 10 catalogues (i.e., around 38%) explicitly document a workflow for data curation, which in two cases is mainly automated; 9 of these are open for modifications to be made to the semantic artefacts by external/registered users. In 11 cases, the catalogue also provides previous resource versions, enabling a versioning system useful for backward compatibility and documentation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Assessment (As)</title><p id="Par127">Most catalogues do not provide information on (self-)assessment against quality criteria. Among the few exceptions, AgroPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> includes an assessment in terms of FAIR score, an evaluation of the satisfaction of each aspect of the FAIR principles. This FAIRness assessment methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> has been recently transposed to 6 other OntoPortal-based catalogues, including solely EcoPortal, in our study. FAIR score includes many questions specific to ontologies and semantic resources, with the ability to compute the score for each resource and the whole catalogue. On the other hand, Archivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> proposes a rating based on a set of automatically assessed criteria (whether the ontology is retrievable and parsed correctly, is provided with a clear and proper license statement, and is logically consistent).</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Final remarks</title><p id="Par128">The analysis showed the current state of the identified catalogues, and it can also serve as a guidance for shaping future developments. The maturity model created was a first attempt toward understanding catalogues of semantic artefacts. In addition, the catalogue assessment we performed was a preliminary (and we believe a successful) attempt to perceive the effectiveness of the maturity model.</p><p id="Par129">The analysis will be complemented in the future with the ongoing work on minimum metadata sets and interoperability indicators currently carried out within the EOSC Task Force on Semantic Interoperability. By combining these efforts, the aim is to provide recommendations for governance and processes for preserving and maintaining semantic artefacts. This will involve identifying gaps and improvement areas in semantic interoperability approaches and developing strategies to address these challenges.</p><p id="Par130">In the future, we aim to interlink aspects of the dimensions identified within the maturity model presented in this paper with recommendations of other EOSC Task Forces. For instance, the ESOC Task Force on FAIR Metrics and Data Quality has produced some guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> that may be used in the context of the <italic>Quality</italic> maturity dimension for providing even more in-depth specifications for measuring the FAIRness of semantic artefacts catalogues. Similarly, the work under development in the EOSC Task Force on PID Policy and Implementation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.eosc.eu/advisory-groups/pid-policy-implementation">https://www.eosc.eu/advisory-groups/pid-policy-implementation</ext-link>) may provide additional insights related to the <italic>PID</italic> maturity dimension highlighted in this article.</p><p id="Par131">Another aspect that would deserve further study concerns the relation of our dimensions with those described in other maturity models available in the literature, such as some of those we used for defining the dimensions. Indeed, it would be essential to make maturity models semantically interoperable since it may also facilitate further analysis of the systems they measure. We will leave this investigation for future developments.</p><p id="Par132">The maturity dimensions, the related features, and the list of assessed catalogues are open for extensions and refinements in the future, especially in light of the feedback from the community. For instance, a few people suggested, via their reviews (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://prereview.org/preprints/doi-10.48550-arxiv.2305.06746">https://prereview.org/preprints/doi-10.48550-arxiv.2305.06746</ext-link>), the addition of further perspectives to include in the maturity model, such as metrics measuring the facility to find specific contextual information in a catalogue, the size of the community using it, its Technological Readiness Level (TRL), its time of existence, and the specification of the types of semantic artefacts handled by a catalogue with appropriate dimensional features associated to each type. Others have already suggested the inclusion of additional catalogues in the assessment. While these are all valid suggestions, further technical analyses are necessary for a future refinement/extension of the maturity model. While currently, within the Task Force, there are no particular plans for adding more technical/operational features, being the data and resources produced in this work available on Zenodo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> will allow and enable the community to create further versions of them if needed, even outside the framework of the EOSC Task Forces.</p><p id="Par133">We believe that having catalogues of semantic artefacts compliant with the dimensions and features we identified in the maturity model is a crucial step towards the broad adoption and reuse in research, by all the involved users (researchers, data stewards, etc.), of the semantic artefacts they provide. Indeed, without sound and well-governed catalogues, we do not have persistence, availability and maintenance of semantic artefacts in the long term; and, without guaranteeing these activities, it is challenging to build users&#x02019; trust in such artefacts, which is crucial to enable and push their broad adoption and reuse in the EOSC and, more generally, in research. However, we recognise a perceived need by the community to extend, in the future, the effort of the EOSC Task Force on Semantic Interoperability to focus on: (a) understanding how semantic artefacts should be used productively in and for research; (b) how data stewards can efficiently and effectively use these artefacts in metadata specification and metadata curation workflows; and (c) how to bring data producers, publishers, researchers, to adopt them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par134">This section presents the methodology followed to identify the dimensions and related features of the maturity model and analyse the catalogues of semantic artefacts. The process was divided into five steps, described in the following subsections.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Analysis of existing literature</title><p id="Par135">We involved all the members of the EOSC Task Force on Semantic Interoperability, which included several experts on the topic with very heterogeneous backgrounds, to provide us with relevant material related to at least one of the two aspects of interest for our study, i.e., (1) definitions of catalogues of semantic artefacts and (2) dimensions that can be used to measure the maturity of such catalogues.</p><p id="Par136">After gathering all such relevant documents, we asked the members of the Task Force to read them and highlight any passage in the text referring either to definitions related to catalogues of semantic artefacts or maturity measures. We also asked that the reading and analysis of each document must be performed, when possible, by a member who did not propose it to avoid possible biases.</p><p id="Par137">We found that 15 of the gathered documents contained relevant texts, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The raw data of this overview are available online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The authors analysed all the quotations highlighted to gather maturity dimensions. In particular, the names of the dimensions were compiled from the analysed literature, thus reusing a terminology already shared with the scientific community and heterogeneously distributed in different documents. The 12 dimensions extracted, which we used as a starting point for identifying additional features characterising them, are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Collection of catalogues</title><p id="Par138">A preliminary search was conducted to collect potential catalogues of semantic artefacts. Potential catalogues of semantic artefacts have been identified by direct knowledge of the co-authors and the other members of the Task Force.</p><p id="Par139">The authors then screened the resulting list of potential catalogues to remove duplicates and those irrelevant to the study. In particular, we decided to keep only those potential catalogues that refer mainly to semantic artefacts in the analysis. This exclusion criterion has been made to filter out (i) generic repositories that may also contain semantic artefacts, even if it is not the primary resource types they refer to (e.g., Zenodo), and (ii) generic repositories (e.g., Google or other general-purpose search engines). The resulting set included 26 selected catalogues. With this list, our goal was not to be exhaustive but to cover multiple application domains well and get a good representation of the underlying technology used to build the catalogues (e.g., OntoPortal, OLS, SKOSMOS, etc.).</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Setup of catalogues assessment</title><p id="Par140">The identified catalogues were evaluated based on their relevance to semantic artefacts. A spreadsheet was created with the selected catalogues listed on rows and the 12 maturity dimensions on columns. Additional columns were dedicated to the authors&#x02019; names (acting as reviewers) and comments. Each reviewer was assigned some catalogues to review.</p><p id="Par141">Twelve separate tabs in the spreadsheet described the possible features characterising each maturity dimension. These tabs contained the name of the dimension and a set of particular features, each with a number, a short name, a description, the name of the reviewer that proposed it, and whether the group had validated it. In addition, there was a column for possible comments.</p><p id="Par142">The main table in the first tab was extended with two additional columns. The first column allowed us to specify whether the catalogue under analysis stores a copy of the semantic artefacts it describes. The second column referred to the software or tool used to implement the catalogue to distinguish if the software adopted was generic (i.e., can be used to deploy multiple catalogues) and open-source.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par143">Each reviewer evaluated a first small set of 2-3 catalogues against the 12 dimensions identified before, which we considered fixed. For each catalogue and each dimension, the reviewer had to select which features of the dimensions applied to the catalogue. If, for a given dimension, a particular feature was not already present, the reviewer could add such a new feature, adding a name and a description for it and making it available for the following reviewers. Several features for each dimension (from 3 to 7), have been added during this step, for a total of 63 potential features.</p><p id="Par144">After the first analysis, early results and issues were discussed by all reviewers. The analysis was then extended by assessing other potential catalogues, i.e., an additional five for each reviewer, to have a clear view of other aspects that did not arise from the former analysis. In addition, we decided to invite other experts (external to the Task Force) to such a study afterwards, ideally after we have assessed all the potential catalogues. Our perceived risk here was to be biased by a particular point of view while we were still in a phase of preliminary analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Harmonization and summarization</title><p id="Par145">After completing the catalogue descriptions, a final review and summarization were conducted. Each reviewer was tasked with analyzing 2 to 4 dimensions to review the corresponding features provided by other reviewers and suggested potential edits such as merging similar features, removing irrelevant ones, or splitting them into separate aspects. As a result, 20 out of 63 identified features have been removed from the analysis or merged with others, keeping 43 final features. The main table was updated accordingly to reflect any changes made by the reviewer.</p><p id="Par146">A final meeting was held to review and harmonize the catalogue dimensions and features to ensure a consistent set of features that could be used to compare and analyze the different catalogues. During this meeting, any remaining inconsistencies or ambiguities in the features were discussed, and final decisions were made on harmonising them across all catalogues.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all members of the EOSC Task Force on Semantic Interoperability and all the reviewers of the prior version of this article (five anonymous experts involved in the single-blind reviewing process of the 22nd International Semantic Web Conference and Scientific Data, plus Allyson L.
