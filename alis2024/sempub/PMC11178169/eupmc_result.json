In view of the shortcomings of existing enterprise blockchain evaluation methods, this paper proposes a multi-source heterogeneous blockchain data quality evaluation model for enterprise business activities, so as to achieve efficient evaluation of business activity information consistency, credibility and value. This paper proposes a multi-source heterogeneous blockchain data quality assessment method for enterprise business activities, aiming at the problems that most of the data in enterprise business activities come from different data sources, information representation is inconsistent, information ambiguity between the same block chain is serious, and it is difficult to evaluate the consistency, credibility and value of information. The method firstly proposes an entity information representation method based on the Representation learning for fusing entity category information (CEKGRL) model, which introduces the triad structure of related entities in blockchain, then associates them with enterprise business activity categories, and carries out similarity calculation through contextual information to achieve blockchain information consistency assessment. After that, a trustworthiness characterization method is proposed based on information sources, information comments, and information contents, to obtain the trustworthiness assessment of the business. Finally, based on the information trustworthiness characterization, a value assessment method is introduced to assess the total value of business activity information in the blockchain, and a blockchain quality assessment model is constructed. The experimental results show that the proposed model has great advantages over existing methods in assessing inter-block consistency, intra-block activity information trustworthiness and the value of blockchain.", "affiliation": "School of Information, Liaoning University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "2022JH2/101300250", "agency": "the Applied Basic Research Program of Liaoning Province", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2023-BS-085", "agency": "the Nature Science Foundation Program Doctoral Startup Project of Liaoning Province", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "230701160261310", "agency": "the Ministry of Education University-Industry Collaborative Education Program", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "JYTMS20230761", "agency": "the General Program of University Basic Scientific Research of Education Department of Liaoning Province (Science and Engineering)", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Data Accuracy"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Blockchain"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0304835"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11178169"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11178169?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "PPR710513", "source": "PPR", "type": "Preprint in", "note": "CrossRef Pre-print loader", "orderIn": "10002"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "doi"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2024-06-14", "dateOfCreation": "2024-06-14", "firstIndexDate": "2024-06-14", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-06-18", "dateOfRevision": "2024-06-18", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-06-14", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-06-14"}
