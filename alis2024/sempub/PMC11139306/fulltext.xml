We address this puzzle by exploiting the ubiquitous function of negation. We track the online effects of negation (&#x0201c;not&#x0201d;) and intensifiers (&#x0201c;really&#x0201d;) on the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;) in parametrically designed behavioral and neurophysiological (MEG) experiments. The behavioral data show that participants first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Decoding analyses of neural activity further reveal significant above chance decoding accuracy for negated adjectives within 600 ms from adjective onset, suggesting that negation does not invert the representation of adjectives (i.e., &#x0201c;not bad&#x0201d; represented as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;); furthermore, decoding accuracy for negated adjectives is found to be significantly lower than that for affirmative adjectives. Overall, these results suggest that negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives. This putative suppression mechanism of negation is supported by increased synchronization of beta-band neural activity in sensorimotor areas. The analysis of negation provides a steppingstone to understand how the human brain represents changes of meaning over time.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Negation is an important concept in natural language but we still know relatively little about the cognitive and neural mechanisms underpinning negation.

The final representations derive in systematic ways from the combination of individual pieces. The composed meanings can be extracted in relatively straightforward ways, such as by sequentially combining individual meanings of words and phrases (e.g., &#x0201c;this theory is correct&#x0201d;) or stem from more subtle inferential processes, where further operations are required to achieve understanding (e.g., &#x0201c;this theory is not even wrong,&#x0201d; meaning &#x0201c;this theory is incoherent&#x0201d;). A mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes requires characterization of how meaning representations are constructed in real time. There has been steady progress and productive debate on syntactic structure building [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, how novel semantic configurations are represented over time is less widely investigated. In the experimental approach pursued here, we build on the existing literature on precisely controlled minimal linguistic environments [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We deploy a new, simple parametric experimental paradigm that capitalizes on the powerful role that negation plays in shaping semantic representations of words. While negation is undoubtfully a complex linguistic operation that can affect comprehension as a function of other linguistic factors (such as discourse and pragmatics [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), our investigation specifically focuses on how negation operates in phrasal structures. Combining behavioral and neurophysiological data, we show how word meaning is (and is not) modulated in controlled contexts that contrast affirmative (e.g., &#x0201c;really good&#x0201d;) and negated (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d;) phrases. The results identify models and mechanisms of how negation, a compelling window into semantic representation, operates in real time.</p><p>Negation is ubiquitous&#x02014;and, therefore, interesting in its own right. Furthermore, it offers a compelling linguistic framework to understand how the human brain builds meaning through combinatoric processes. Intuitively, negated concepts (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d;) entertain some relation with the affirmative concept (e.g., &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;) as well as their counterpart (e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d;). The function of negation in natural language has been a matter of longstanding debate among philosophers, psychologists, logicians, and linguists [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In spite of its intellectual history and relevance (interpreting negation was, famously, a point of debate between Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein), comparatively little research investigates the cognitive and neural mechanisms underpinning negation. Previous work shows that negated phrases/sentences are processed with more difficulty (slower, with more errors) than the affirmative counterparts, suggesting an asymmetry between negated and affirmative representations; furthermore, state-of-the-art artificial neural networks appear to be largely insensitive to the contextual impacts of negation [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This asymmetry motivates one fundamental question: <italic toggle="yes">how</italic> does negation operate?</p><p>Studies addressing this question suggest that negation operates as a suppression mechanism by reducing the extent of available information [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], either in 2 steps [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or in 1 incremental step [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; other studies demonstrate that negation is rapidly and dynamically integrated into meaning representations [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], even unconsciously [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Within the context of action representation (e.g., &#x0201c;cut,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;wish&#x0201d;), previous research suggests that negation recruits general-purpose inhibitory and cognitive control systems [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>While the majority of neuroimaging studies focused on how negation affects action representation, psycholinguistic research shows that scalar adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;bad-good,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;close-open,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;empty-full&#x0201d;) offer insight into how negation operates on semantic representations of single words. These studies provide behavioral evidence that negation can either <italic toggle="yes">eliminate</italic> the negated concept and convey the opposite meaning (&#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d;) or <italic toggle="yes">mitigate</italic> the meaning of its antonym along a semantic continuum (&#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;less good,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;average,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;somehow bad&#x0201d;; [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Thus, the system of polar opposites generated by scalar adjectives provides an especially useful testbed to investigate changes in representation of abstract concepts along a semantic scale (e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;), as a function of negation (e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d;).</p><p>Here, we capitalize on the semantic continuum offered by scalar adjectives to investigate <italic toggle="yes">how</italic> negation operates on the representation of abstract concepts (e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;). First, we track how negation affects semantic representations over time in a behavioral mouse tracking study (and a replication study; <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Next, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a decoding approach to track the evolution of neural representations of target adjectives in affirmative and negated phrases (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Mouse tracking and decoding approaches allow us to quantify and compare dynamic changes in participants&#x02019; interpretations and neural representations of adjectives over time (e.g., [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). We test 4 hypotheses: (1) negation does not change the representation of adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;); (2) negation weakens the representation of adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; &#x0003c; &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;); (3) negation inverts the representation of adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d;); and (4) negation changes the representation of adjectives to another representation (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = e.g., &#x0201c;unacceptable&#x0201d;). The combined behavioral and neurophysiological data adjudicate among these hypotheses and identify potential mechanisms that underlie how negation functions in online meaning construction. Emerging temporal dynamics clarify how the effect of negation on adjective meaning unfolds over time, whether incrementally (i.e., in parallel to adjective processing) or serially (i.e., in a second step after adjective processing).</p><fig position="float" id="pbio.3002622.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Experimental procedures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral procedure. Participants read affirmative or negated adjective phrases (e.g., &#x0201c;really really good,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;### not bad&#x0201d;) word by word and rated the overall meaning of each phrase on a scale.

Before each trial, participants were informed about the scale direction, e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;good,&#x0201d; i.e., 1 to 10. Scale direction was pseudorandomized across blocks.

More significantly, mouse trajectories show that participants initially interpreted negated phrases as affirmative (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; is located on the &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; side of the scale, for approximately 130 ms, <bold>Figs <xref rid="pbio.3002622.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref></bold>), indicating that initial representations of negated scalar adjectives are closer to the representations of the adjectives rather than that of their antonyms.

We contrasted 4 hypotheses (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref></bold>): Negation (1) does not change the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;good,&#x0201d; <italic toggle="yes">No effect</italic>); (2) weakens the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; &#x0003c; &#x0201c;good,&#x0201d; <italic toggle="yes">Mitigation</italic>); (3) inverts the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;bad,&#x0201d; <italic toggle="yes">Inversion</italic>); or (4) changes the representation of scalar adjectives to another representation (e.g., &#x0201c;not good&#x0201d; = e.g., &#x0201c;unacceptable,&#x0201d; <italic toggle="yes">Change</italic>). These 4 hypotheses make predictions about how negation operates on scalar adjectives at any given time. It is thus possible that multiple mechanisms may unfold over time when looking at time-resolved data (e.g., first <italic toggle="yes">no effect</italic> and then <italic toggle="yes">inversion</italic>). Using 2 complementary decoding approaches, we demonstrated that, within the time window of adjective encoding, the representation of affirmative adjectives generalizes to that of negated adjectives (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6D</xref></bold>). This finding rules out predictions (3) <italic toggle="yes">Inversion</italic> and (4) <italic toggle="yes">Change</italic>. Moreover, these findings complement our behavioral data that show that negated adjectives are initially interpreted by participants as affirmative. Second, we showed that the representation of adjectives in affirmative and negated phrases is not identical but is weakened by negation (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and 6E</xref></bold>). This result rules out prediction (1) <italic toggle="yes">No effect</italic> and supports prediction (2) <italic toggle="yes">Mitigation</italic>, wherein negation weakens the representation of adjectives. We observed such a reduction in early representations (i.e., within approximately 300 ms from adjective onset). This finding is consistent with previous research that reported effects of negation as soon as lexical-semantic representations of words are formed [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and not exclusively at later processing stages (e.g., P600 [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]). In addition, the fact that <italic toggle="yes">low</italic> versus <italic toggle="yes">high</italic> adjectives are decodable approximately 400 ms after the adjective onset in negated phrases (<bold>Figs <xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref></bold>, <bold>and <xref rid="pbio.3002622.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref>)</bold> raises 2 novel questions: First, is the mitigation effect of negation stable over time? Second, at what exact stages does it operate upon (see [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>])? Using a masked priming paradigm, van Gaal and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] analyzed participants&#x02019; EEG responses to sequences of words that were either consciously or unconsciously perceived. Their findings indicate that the meaning of multiple words, including negation, can be integrated even when participants report not seeing them, but that conscious perception is required for later grammatical integration. Future research remains necessary to more precisely tease apart the lexical, semantic, and syntactic features that are selectively affected by the negation operator over time.</p><p>Taken together, our behavioral and neural data jointly point to a <italic toggle="yes">mitigation</italic> rather than an <italic toggle="yes">inversion</italic> effect of negation at early semantic processing stages and exclude the hypothesis according to which negation does not change the representation of antonyms (i.e., first processing step in 2-step accounts [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Specifically, these results show that initial interpretations and early neural representations of negated adjectives are similar to that of affirmative adjectives, but weakened. One possible limitation is that visual features might still be deciphered and consequently affect the analyses presented in <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref></bold>. If the consistency or probability of visual features influences the decoding performance, discriminating between the predicted patterns for our competing hypotheses may become more difficult. For example, if the underlying representation is a changed representation (see 4 in <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref></bold>), but part of the decoding performance is attributable to visual consistencies, that could effectively increase the overall decoding performance, leading to a pattern consistent with mitigation (see 2 in <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref></bold>). Two factors mitigate this potential issue: First, our stimulus set by design contains words with varying visual features, which makes it difficult for a linear decoder to identify a common visual feature to rely on; Second, generalized representations shown for decoding approach (i) last up to 550 ms from adjective onset, likely reflecting lexical-semantic rather than purely perceptual processing [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The comparison between MEG and behavioral results also reveals interesting differences. Behavioral data reveal that, in negated phrases, participants later modify their initial interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Our MEG data do not show an inversion of adjective representation as a function of negation, at early or later lexical-semantic processing stages. Differences between our behavioral and neural results could be ascribed to the fact that the behavioral task had to be adapted to the MEG environment. In the behavioral experiment (and its replication), participants were continuously and explicitly indicating their interpretations in a bidimensional space (i.e., the semantic scale defined by the polar adjectives). Conversely, the MEG experiment allowed us to measure neural correlates of semantic representation over time (not affected by motor activity) but not the explicit interpretations, which were collected only after the probe was presented (1,850 ms after the adjective presentation) and only through a yes/no decision task (<bold>Figs <xref rid="pbio.3002622.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref></bold>). Thus, both our designs present advantages and limitations and together offer a more encompassing approach: Bidimensional semantic scales in the behavioral task could have masked nuanced changes in semantic representation over time, which we were able to better evaluate in the MEG data; in turn, later effects of negation might have been masked by the task employed in the MEG experiment; however, they were more carefully assessed in our behavioral approach. Design limitations are crucial when interpreting behavioral and neuroimaging findings. Adopting a multimodality approach (e.g., behavioral mouse tracking and MEG recordings) helps overcome some of the limitations related to individual experimental approaches; our complementary approaches allowed us to advance a well-motivated interpretation.</p><p>While previous fMRI studies on sentential negation have shown that negation reduces hemodynamic brain activations related to verb processing [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the current study offers novel time-resolved behavioral and neural data on how negation selectively operates on abstract concepts. Previous research has highlighted that negation might behave differently depending on the pragmatics of discourse interpretation, e.g., when presented in isolation as compared to when presented in context (&#x0201c;not wrong&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;this theory is not wrong&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), or when used ironically (&#x0201c;they are not really good&#x0201d; said ironically to mean that they are &#x0201c;mediocre,&#x0201d; e.g., [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]). Within this pragmatic framework, it has been suggested that the opposite meaning of a scalar adjective would be more simply conveyed by the affirmative counterpart than by negation [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]; thus, to convey the opposite meaning of &#x0201c;bad,&#x0201d; it would be more appropriate to use &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; as opposed to &#x0201c;not bad.&#x0201d; Following this logic, negation would be purposefully used (and understood) to convey a different, mitigated meaning of the adjective (e.g., &#x0201c;not bad&#x0201d; = &#x0201c;less than bad&#x0201d;). Although we did not directly manipulate sentential or pragmatic contexts, our findings provide behavioral and neural evidence that negation acts as a mitigator. Here, we only tested adjective pairs that form <italic toggle="yes">contraries</italic> (which lie on a continuum, e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;); thus, inherently different patterns of results could emerge in the case of <italic toggle="yes">contradictories</italic> (which form a dichotomy, e.g., &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;alive&#x0201d;; [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), where there is no continuum for mitigation to have an effect.</p><p>Overall, evidence that negation weakens adjective representations invites the hypothesis that negation operates as a suppression mechanism, possibly through general-purpose inhibitory systems [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To address this, we compared beta power modulations in affirmative and negated phrases (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>). In addition to subserving motor processing, beta-power modulation (12 to 30 Hz) has been associated with attention and expectancy violation and with multiple aspects of language processing, such as semantic memory and syntactic binding, as well as feedback processing ([<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]; for a review, see [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). We evaluated differences between negated and affirmative phrases separately in the low- and high-beta bands. We found greater power for negated than affirmative phrases in both bands, during the processing of the modifier and throughout the processing of the adjective up to approximately 700 ms, localized in left-lateralized sensorimotor areas. The timing and spatial correlates of beta-power in relation to negation align with studies that examined the effect of negation on (mental and motor) action representation [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Strikingly, we demonstrated that negation recruits brain areas and neurophysiological mechanisms similar to that recruited by response inhibition&#x02014;however, in the absence of action-related language material. Within a framework that recognizes 2 interactive neural systems, i.e., a semantic representation and a semantic control system [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], negation would operate through the latter, modulating how activation propagates through the (ventral) language semantic network wherein meaning is represented. The precise connectivity that underpins mitigation of lexical-semantic representations remains to be investigated.</p><p>It is uncontroversial that negation is a fundamental operation in language and cognition. A comprehensive cognitive model of negation has been elusive. Our design (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>), the explicit hypothesis space we consider (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref></bold>), and the choice of methodologies we employ derive from the careful consideration of the different theoretical frameworks [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To be sure, we also built on existing behavioral measures (i.e., response time and accuracies; [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), psycholinguistic approaches (i.e., effects of negation on scalar adjectives; [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]), and neuroimaging domains (i.e., time, space, and frequency domains; [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) that have been used in the study of negation. Our insights contribute decisive new data to the debate on how negation operates by showing that negation functions as a mitigator of lexical-semantic representations of scalar adjectives, possibly through general-purpose inhibitory systems. The results also speak to the question of when negation operates by showing early effects of negation on adjective processing. More broadly, we show that, by characterizing subtle changes of linguistic meaning through negation, using time-resolved behavioral and neuroimaging methods and multivariate decoding, we can tease apart different possible representational outcomes of combinatorial operations, above and beyond the sum of the processing of individual word meanings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Participants</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Experiment 1 (and replication): Continuous behavioral tracking</title><p>A total of 101 participants (46 females; mean age = 29.6 years; range 18 to 67 years) completed an online mouse tracking experiment.

The online experiment was developed using oTree, a Python-based framework for the development of controlled experiments on online platforms [<xref rid="pbio.3002622.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Participants performed this study remotely, using their own monitor and mouse (touchpads were not allowed). They were instructed to read affirmative or negated adjective phrases (e.g., &#x0201c;really really good,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;really not bad&#x0201d;) and rate the overall meaning of each phrase on a scale, e.g., from &#x0201c;really really bad&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;really really good.&#x0201d; Participants were initially familiarized with the experiment through short videos and a short practice block (18 trials with feedback). They were instructed that the poles of the scale (e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;) would be reversed in half of the trials and warned that (i) they could not cross the vertical borders of the response space; (ii) they had to maintain a constant velocity, by following an horizontal line moving vertically; and (iii) they could not rate the meaning of the phrase before the third word was presented. At the beginning of each trial, a response area of 600 (horizontal) &#x000d7; 450 (vertical) pixels and a solid line at the top of the rectangle were presented (<bold><xref rid="pbio.3002622.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Participants were informed about the scale (e.g., quality) and the direction of the scale (e.g., &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;bad,&#x0201d; i.e., 1 to 10 or 10 to 1). Participants were instructed to click on the &#x0201c;start&#x0201d; button and move the cursor of the mouse to the portion of the scale that best represented the overall meaning of the phrase. The &#x0201c;start&#x0201d; button was placed in the center portion of the bottom of the response space (i.e., in a neutral position). Once &#x0201c;start&#x0201d; was clicked on, information about the scale and scale direction disappeared, leaving only the solid line on screen. Phrases were presented at the top of the response space, from the time when participants clicked on &#x0201c;start,&#x0201d; one word at a time, each word for 250 ms (inter-word-interval: 50 ms). After each trial, participants were provided the &#x0201c;incorrect&#x0201d; feedback if the cursor&#x02019;s movement violated the warnings provided during the familiarization phase, and an explanation was provided (e.g., &#x0201c;you crossed the vertical borders&#x0201d;). To keep participants engaged, we provided feedback also based on the final interpretation: &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d; if the response was in the half of the scale opposite to the adjective (for the conditions: &#x0201c;### ###,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;#### really,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;really ###,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;really really&#x0201d;), or in the same half of the scale of the adjective (for the conditions: &#x0201c;### not&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not ###&#x0201d;), or in the outer 20% left and right portions of the scale (for the conditions: &#x0201c;really not,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not really,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;not not&#x0201d;); feedback was &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; otherwise. In case of a trial with negative feedback, the following trial was delayed for 4 seconds. For each trial, we collected continuous mouse trajectories and RTs. The overall duration of the behavioral experiment was approximately 90 minutes.

The order of the yes/no response keys was swapped halfway through the experiment. Responses had no time limit.

Sampling rate was 1,000 Hz, and online high-pass filter of 1 Hz and low-pass filter of 200 Hz were applied. Five electromagnetic coils were attached to the forehead of the participants and their position was measured twice, before the first and after the last block.

This suggests that the representation of modifiers is reactivated at the stage when participants have to perform the yes/no task. 1 modifier: &#x0201c;really ###,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;### really,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not ###,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;### not&#x0201d;; 2 modifiers: &#x0201c;really really,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;really not,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not really,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not not.&#x0201d; AUC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, chance = 0.5 (black dashed horizontal line); the black vertical dashed line indicates the presentation onset of the probe; aff = affirmative, neg = negated; each line and shading represent participants mean &#x000b1; SEM.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3002622.s002.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pbio.3002622.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Temporal decoding of composed meaning.</title><p>We trained estimators on phrases where the predicted composed meaning was &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; in 90% of the trials and computed the accuracy of the model in predicting the representation of the meaning &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; in the remaining 10% of the trials.

</p><p>Dear Dr Zuanazzi, </p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript entitled "Tracking the behavioral and neural dynamics of semantic representations through negation" for consideration as a Research Article by PLOS Biology.</p><p>Your manuscript has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editorial staff as well as by an academic editor with relevant expertise and I am writing to let you know that we would like to send your submission out for external peer review.</p><p>However, before we can send your manuscript to reviewers, we need you to complete your submission by providing the metadata that is required for full assessment. To this end, please login to Editorial Manager where you will find the paper in the 'Submissions Needing Revisions' folder on your homepage. Please click 'Revise Submission' from the Action Links and complete all additional questions in the submission questionnaire.</p><p>Once your full submission is complete, your paper will undergo a series of checks in preparation for peer review. After your manuscript has passed the checks it will be sent out for review. To provide the metadata for your submission, please Login to Editorial Manager (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology</ext-link>) within two working days, i.e. by Aug 11 2023 11:59PM.</p><p>If your manuscript has been previously peer-reviewed at another journal, PLOS Biology is willing to work with those reviews in order to avoid re-starting the process. Submission of the previous reviews is entirely optional and our ability to use them effectively will depend on the willingness of the previous journal to confirm the content of the reports and share the reviewer identities. Please note that we reserve the right to invite additional reviewers if we consider that additional/independent reviewers are needed, although we aim to avoid this as far as possible. In our experience, working with previous reviews does save time. </p><p>If you would like us to consider previous reviewer reports, please edit your cover letter to let us know and include the name of the journal where the work was previously considered and the manuscript ID it was given. In addition, please upload a response to the reviews as a 'Prior Peer Review' file type, which should include the reports in full and a point-by-point reply detailing how you have or plan to address the reviewers' concerns. </p><p>During the process of completing your manuscript submission, you will be invited to opt-in to posting your pre-review manuscript as a bioRxiv preprint. Visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/preprints" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/preprints</ext-link> for full details.

<named-content content-type="letter-date">26 Sep 2023</named-content>
</p><p>Dear Dr Zuanazzi,</p><p>Thank you for your patience while your manuscript "Tracking the behavioral and neural dynamics of semantic representations through negation" was peer-reviewed at PLOS Biology. It has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by several independent reviewers. </p><p>In light of the reviews, which you will find at the end of this email, we would like to invite you to revise the work to thoroughly address the reviewers' reports.</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers think that the study is overall well executed and provides important insights. However, Reviewer 1 has some concerns about the consistency between MEG and behavioural findings, and also a couple of technical and conceptual concerns. Reviewer 2 also raises conceptual concerns, while Reviewer 3 is the most positive reviewer and has only relatively minor concerns.</p><p>After discussing the reports with the Academic Editor, who agrees with Reviewer 2' conceptual concerns, we encourage you take the opportunity to further clarify and organize the conceptual and theoretical claims when revising your manuscript. This would include to refrain from interpreting the timecourse and strength of decoding effects so directly, better developing the idea/theory that negation would result in an inverse of the neural response or in decoding performance, and better fleshing out the idea of mitigation (conceptually and ideally formally).</p><p>Given the extent of revision needed, we cannot make a decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is likely to be sent for further evaluation by all or a subset of the reviewers.</p><p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 3 months. Please email us (<email>plosbiology@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to request an extension. </p><p>At this stage, your manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal; please notify us by email if you do not intend to submit a revision so that we may withdraw it.</p><p>**IMPORTANT - SUBMITTING YOUR REVISION**</p><p>Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. Please submit the following files along with your revised manuscript:</p><p>1. A 'Response to Reviewers' file - this should detail your responses to the editorial requests, present a point-by-point response to all of the reviewers' comments, and indicate the changes made to the manuscript. </p><p>*NOTE: In your point-by-point response to the reviewers, please provide the full context of each review. Do not selectively quote paragraphs or sentences to reply to. The entire set of reviewer comments should be present in full and each specific point should be responded to individually, point by point.</p><p>You should also cite any additional relevant literature that has been published since the original submission and mention any additional citations in your response. </p><p>2. In addition to a clean copy of the manuscript, please also upload a 'track-changes' version of your manuscript that specifies the edits made. This should be uploaded as a "Revised Article with Changes Highlighted" file type. </p><p>*Re-submission Checklist*</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit your revised manuscript, please refer to this re-submission checklist: <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.io/Biology_Checklist" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.io/Biology_Checklist</ext-link></p><p>To submit a revised version of your manuscript, please go to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. Click the link labelled 'Submissions Needing Revision' where you will find your submission record. </p><p>Please make sure to read the following important policies and guidelines while preparing your revision:</p><p>*Published Peer Review*</p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. Please see here for more details:</p><p>

</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>REVIEWS:</p><p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript investigates the time course of negated phrases in an abstract semantic meaning context. The authors used a behavioral paradigm and an MEG study to show that negation does not simply invert the meaning of the word, but rather mitigates the meaning of a words. This study used a smart paradigm and combined this with nice decoding approaches. I have some questions and remarks.</p><p>Questions regarding the consistency of the MEG and the behavioral findings.</p><p>1) In the behavioral findings you show that participant first interpret the word as written and only later revert the meaning. Was it investigated whether the representations in MEG show the same pattern? If this pattern couldn't be found, how do the authors interpret this?</p><p>2) The behavioral findings of final word interpretation don't really speak in favor for mitigation, but rather are in line with the inversion (not a full inversion, but still inverted). How do the authors connect the finding of the behavior with the MEG?</p><p>Question on the decoding approach</p><p>3) Hypothesis figure in 5. Why for the change interpretation wouldn't one be able to decode in analysis ii) the affirmative conditions anymore? In my opinion the 'changed' representation would simply add noise to the training data set. Therefore, you could still decode the affirmative (maybe less strongly though).</p><p>4) In all the decoding approaches for low versus high there are only 4 words in the low and 4 words in the high category. It is possible that some of the word-specific, potentially visual features end up in the decoding rather than having it based on valence? This promotes the decoding of the negated to be in-line with the affirmative option which might only related to irrelevant features. This will make it more difficult to find anything in line with the inversion hypothesis (which is more what the behavior speaks for). To get around this, I would train on three of the word pairs and test on the last word pair (and cross-validate). In this way one is sure that the effects are not due to any early sensory processing. </p><p>5) In the mitigation hypothesis, one would also expect that when tested and trained on affirmative condition the decoding should work better than when tested and trained on negated condition. This occurs because it is more difficult to decode when the features are closer in some abstract multi-dimensional space (which is assume for the mitigation). I wondered why this analysis was not pursued as it seems the most simple one.</p><p>6) If you believe that there is a linear space on which the features can be mapped, why not approach the decoding as a regression rather than a binary feature. Then you could map everything in one go.</p><p>Questions on design/method choices</p><p>7) Why are the words for the MEG and behavior different?</p><p>8) Wouldn't it make sense to also analyze the data taking the 'not not' out? I understand you had it original because of the factorial design, but if for the participants it is so different one cannot really treat is as such (as also supplementary figure 2 shows).</p><p>9) Why was decoding limited to only correct trials? This might force the analysis to only be focused on trials where the decoding was in line with the experimentally induced representation of the negated items. </p><p>Questions on interpretation</p><p>10) In my opinion the 'replication' which is now the supplementary should be the main figure of the behavioral paper. If feedback was given what is the right answer in the original study you did not show how negation is represented, merely how participants can learn to follow instructions. It is good that the main patterns replicate, but I feel that now it is deceiving to put the effect so strongly as they appear in figure 1.</p><p>11) I don't really see how you can define accuracy here. Depending on the context 'not bad' could feel closer to 'good' or closer to 'bad'. So, given that here there is no context how can you ever provide a definition of accuracy? This is a problem for the original behavioral study (especially as conclusion are drawn based on this). But it is the same issue with the MEG. How can you provide feedback on a 1-8 scale on how to interpret these abstract phrases? I also wonder whether this feedback forces people to represent the information in a specific manner that is forced by the experimenter. In the behavioral data that is now checked, but in the MEG not so this could bias the decoding.</p><p>12) Is beta necessarily inhibition or could it also be something else? Beta has also been implied generally for feedback, not necessary for negative feedback.</p><p>13) In the conclusion it is stated that the behavioral effect shows that the negation never inverts the meaning of the word. While I agree it shows that it never completely inverts the meaning, one cannot state there is no inversion at all. It almost seems to suggest that the behavioral effects of the final decision support the MEG results, which I find quite a strong interpretation gives that in the MEG the negation does not cause a negated interpretation, but in the behavior it does. I think the trajectories have a good story that the initial representation matches the affirmative adjective, but for the final decision I think it simply doesn't match.</p><p>Other</p><p>14) In the abstract a conclusion is made on the MEG, but it would be nice to spend just a few words on how this conclusion could be reached.</p><p>15) Line 671. What does the swapping of yes/no means. Is it just the response buttons or something else? This wasn't clear.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The article tests how combinatoric representation of negation and adjectives operates in both behavioral and MEG experiments. The results from RT and mouse trajectory show that negated adjectives do not change into the opposite meaning (e.g. "not good" doesn't become "bad".). The MEG decoding analysis shows that negation mitigates the meaning of antonyms, ruling out other three possible hypotheses (i.e., no change, inversion, change). The authors also report that beta power was increased in negation, in line with the suppression effect in the previous research. Overall, I found the research was conducted in a rigorous way. It is also valuable to see what kind of combinatoric processes relating to negation occur in our brain. However, the overall analysis is unclear to address the research question. Please find below for my comments. </p><p>Major comments: I was confused when I read the plots since it's not really straightforward and clear what conditions the authors compared. The authors had an elegant design of the experiment. However, it is not clear to me how they compare the conditions they have. For example, in Fig.4C, they showed decoding accuracy of negation with 1 and 2 modifiers. "1 modifier" could mean "### really good", "### not good", "really ### good", "not ### good". Maybe also including an example explicitly in the plot might make it clearer. Also, I am concerned about the effect of placeholder "###". For my intuition, it would be weird to read the stimuli like "really ### good". I think the authors should have some additional analysis to rule out any potential effect from the placeholder. For example, should there be no difference when comparing "### really" vs. "really ###" if the placeholder does not affect the combinatoric processes? The overall article may mainly focus on the comparison "really not good" vs. "really really good", but why not just compare "really good" vs. "not good"? I was not really sure if the experiments really needed stimuli with placeholder if they didn't show full analysis on those stimuli. Since the authors have included stimuli with "###", I think the authors should also analyze them or specify them explicitly in the text/plots. </p><p>Overall, it is sometimes not straightforward how some analyses address the research questions. For example, how does the analysis in Fig. 4A and 4B address the neural processes of negation? It seems like the comprehensive design is used somewhat incompletely in terms of the contrasts used in certain analyses (when pooling over different modifier conditions. In general, the steps between questions, hypotheses, predictions (of the results) and analyses could be more clearer. </p><p>Minor comments: </p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Ln 72-75: It's not clear to me here what you mean: "the building blocks" and "stem from more subtle inferential meaning". The examples given here could be explained further. </p><p>Ln 119: why is the decoding approach applied? </p><p>Results/Methods</p><p>Exp1</p><p>Reaction times</p><p>Ln 170-171: Participants were faster for affirmative phrases (e.g. really really good) than for negated phrases (e.g. really not good). What about "not really good" and also "really good" vs. "not good"? I also wonder if there is a difference in "### really" vs. "really ###" and "### not" vs. "not ###". I would expect no difference here. It would be great if the authors could provide pairwise comparisons here. </p><p>Exp 2</p><p>Ln 736: Please include the interval of the number of removed components.</p><p>Ln 752: Why was the noise covariance matrix estimated from the 300ms before the onset of the first word? And up to when? </p><p>Ln 774-775: So does it mean that there is a threshold for the number of trials to decide when you use 5-fold/10-fold cross-validation? Is it possible to report a number here? </p><p>Ln 796/Ln 809 / Ln 351: maybe state explicitly what train/test set were used for both decoding approaches. The authors only mentioned train/test for the first approach, but not the second, though I assume the train set would include "really really bad/good" and "really not bad/good". </p><p>Ln 817-819/Fig. 5A: Though it looks like the authors provided some kind of explanation here, I am still not clear why the prediction of (3) inversion would have the same prediction of (4)? Why not expect a reversed direction for negation? </p><p>Fig.3: overall, I am not sure if these really reflect single word processing for modifiers. The authors might need to include control analysis of isolated adjective ("### ### good") and also ba</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="pbio.3002622.r003"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>REVIEWS:</p><p>Reviewer #1: I thank the reviewers for their elaborate responses. Many of my points have been addressed. I do still have a few remaining point that need addressing. </p><p>1) The authors try to link the MEG and the behavioral data. Indeed, I agree that at the early stages of the behavioral choices the participants for the negated options divert first to the other response option (which could be indicative of mitigation). However, to better link the behavioral data to the MEG data, it would be good to show that at the decision stage there is an inversion in the MEG responses as well. This can be done by locking the data to the probe or to the response and repeating the decoding analysis. Especially considering that they have reverted the response options there is no confound of button presses here.</p><p>2) I do not feel that the authors acknowledge the problem of visual similarity ending up in the decoding sufficiently. While I acknowledge that their blocked design makes it difficult to do this analysis, I still hold that if visual features influence the decoding, it is difficult to differentiate the outcome expectations for the different models. For example, see figure 6. Let us say that the true underlying representation is a changed representation (4), but part of the decoding is due to visual differences. That would effectively increase the overall decoding (as the sensory representations are the same). This increase would lead exactly to a pattern consistent with mitigation. I do not think they can currently differentiate these options. </p><p>Reviewer #3: I read the revised manuscript and the authors' rebuttal to my comments, which were satisfactorily addressed. I have no further comments and so endorse this manuscript for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="pbio.3002622.r005"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

This revised version of your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, the Academic Editor and the original reviewers.</p><p>Based on the reviews and on our Academic Editor's assessment of your revision, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, provided you satisfactorily address the remaining points raised. </p><p>In particular, we would like your text to reflect that without quantification or control of perceptual processes and their contribution to decoding, the situation Reviewer 1 described in the previous round of review could occur; and we would like to make this point clearer to the reader in the discussion. One suggestion would be:</p><p>"However, we note that if the consistency or probability of visual features influences the decoding performance, discriminating between the predicted patterns for our competing hypotheses becomes more difficult. For example, if the underlying representation is a changed representation (see 4 in Fig.6), but part of the decoding performance is attributable to visual consistencies, that would effectively increase the overall decoding performance, leading to a pattern consistent with mitigation (see 2 in Fig.6)."</p><p>Please note that we offer this text as a guideline, and you are, of course, are free to adapt it.</p><p>Please also make sure to address the following data and other policy-related requests.</p><p>* We would like to suggest a different title to improve readability for our broad audience: "Negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives"</p><p>* Please add the links to the funding agencies in the Financial Disclosure statement in the manuscript details.</p><p>* Please include information about the form of consent (written/oral) given for research involving human participants.
