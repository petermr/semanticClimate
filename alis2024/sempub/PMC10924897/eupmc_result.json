The emotional orientation of danmakus can reflect the attitudes and opinions of viewers on video segments, which can help video platforms optimize video content recommendation and evaluate users' abnormal emotion levels. Aiming at the problems of low transferability of traditional sentiment analysis methods in the danmaku domain, low accuracy of danmaku text segmentation, poor consistency of sentiment annotation, and insufficient semantic feature extraction, this paper proposes a video danmaku sentiment analysis method based on MIBE-RoBERTa-FF-BiLSTM. This paper constructs a \"Bilibili Must-Watch List and Top Video Danmaku Sentiment Dataset\" by ourselves, covering 10,000 positive and negative sentiment danmaku texts of 18 themes. A new word recognition algorithm based on mutual information (MI) and branch entropy (BE) is used to discover 2610 irregular network popular new words from trigrams to heptagrams in the dataset, forming a domain lexicon. The Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory is applied to guide the consistent sentiment annotation. The domain lexicon is integrated into the feature fusion layer of the RoBERTa-FF-BiLSTM model to fully learn the semantic features of word information, character information, and context information of danmaku texts and perform sentiment classification. Comparative experiments on the dataset show that the model proposed in this paper has the best comprehensive performance among the mainstream models for video danmaku text sentiment classification, with an F1 value of 94.06%, and its accuracy and robustness are also better than other models. The limitations of this paper are that the construction of the domain lexicon still requires manual participation and review, the semantic information of danmaku video content and the positive case preference are ignored.", "affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xidian University, 266 Xifeng Road, Xi'an, 710071, China. zhaojianbo@stu.xidian.edu.cn.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "2021ZD0113702", "agency": "Ministry of Science and Technology of the People\u00b4s Republic of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "20KYPT0003-10", "agency": "Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology,China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "20KYPT0003-10", "agency": "Xi&apos;an Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology,China", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Feature Fusion", "Sentiment Analysis", "Mibe-roberta-ff-bilstm", "New Word Discovery", "Sentiment Annotation"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56518-z"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10924897"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10924897?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "PPR782090", "source": "PPR", "type": "Preprint in", "note": "CrossRef Pre-print loader", "orderIn": "10002"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-03-09", "firstIndexDate": "2024-03-10", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-03-12", "dateOfRevision": "2024-03-12", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-03-09", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-03-09"}
