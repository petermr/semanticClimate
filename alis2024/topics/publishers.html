<h1 id="scholarly-publishing">Scholarly publishing</h1>
<p>Why do we still have scholarly publishing? It is not technically necessary to have commercial publishers. Take the examples of theses or research grant proposals, which undergo intensive peer-review and where the University/Funder is fully capable of reviewing and publishing. There are many price-free “publishers” where neither the author or reader pays (opaquely labelled “diamond”), and where the material is available to all for “ever”. We [AG and PMR] have published with J.O.S.S which has intensive peer review and also (unlike almost all other publishers) validates the material. One invitee [ABG] runs a world-class “diamond” publisher for the Global South and another [BB] has shown that the actual costs of publication are affordable (&lt;= 500 USD) within the current scholarly/grant system.</p>
<p>Yet the world of scholpub is increasingly moving towards a model dominated by megacapitalist surveillance publishers and no funders or institutions knows how to change this. The sole purpose of this is now to reward CEOs and shareholders with massive profit margins. The scale of this is reviewed by Buranyi in the (UK) Guardian newspaper []. He interviewed extensively and showed that the driving force for authors was career advancement and ranking for universities. The values are broken. Even society publishers are dragged into this mess.</p>
<p>This is not primarily about cost; the world can and should sponsor global publishing for everyone. It’s about control and values, specifically both neocolonialist Global North and megacapitalism combined. This is coupled with an effective oligarchy with no price control and no subtitutability (non-fungible). The major researchers (universities) have ceded power to the publishing industry in return for “glory”. The only value that most publishers add is their badge, which allows algorithms to decide the computable worth of people and their instutions. Read Buranyi again.</p>
<p>I have called this the “Publisher-Academic Complex” in similarity to the “Military-Industrial-Aacademic Complex” identified by Eisenhower[]. Value- and resource-flows are shown in this diagram []</p>

<p>Our world needs open, peer-reviewed, trustable scholarship for everything and especially for urgent global matters such as climate</p>
