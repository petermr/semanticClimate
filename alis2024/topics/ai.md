#  AI, ML and formal semantics

Won't AI make all this semantics unnecessary? 

No, because. 

	 * Much AI is actually Machine Learning with increasingly sophisticated networks and feedback for training. 
	 The feedback needs an implicit semantic structure if we want to build our own. Dictionaries and ontologies 
	 make training machines much easier. Well structured input (such as we are producing) is also very valuable.
	 * the current AI-hype is driven almost completely by non-transparent surveillance megacapitalists (mainly 
	in US and China). They scrape every document they can find without permission and do not expose provenance. This leads to 
	undetectable hallucinations and huge resentment. It is a very bad model for responsible semantic knowledge on, say,
	climate change.
	
We *do* use ML/AI tools in our semantifcation, from Open Source wherever possible. There are well trained Open models in HuggingFace and Harshul has pioneered their use in summarising (reducing the size of) our content.
