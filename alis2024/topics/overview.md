## Ranganathan and current values

Inspired by Ranganathan, we list some of the values and implementations we think he would have urged today. We are also conscious of the climate crisis. Temperatures have exceeded 52C in Delhi and round the world people, animals and plants are being destroyed by floods, heat, sea-level rise, storms, failing ecosystems, rise of disease, etc. The physical library now has little material value except preservation and social space. The library has a social purpose but is threatened by lack of funding and use, distributed tools (free/commercial), and aggressive commercial takeover (especially Global North (GN)). 

Our SRR-inspired values are:
* knowledge is a public good and must be used for human benefit
* knowledge and tools must be Open and under the control of trustable organisations
* everyone (all ages, all countries and societies) are part of this; the ivory tower of knowledge must go
* commerce should provide service, not control
* surveillance and nontransparent re-use destroys humanity

## overview

This is article is different from conventional scholarly publications. The current metaphor was set in C20th and has essentially not changed. It was initially constrained by the printed page where a "publisher" was necessary for creation and distribution. It remained in that tradition when electronic authoring and distribution emerged despite the success of self-publishing ca. 1994 (WWW, Mosaic []). Our current article is a homage to Ranganathan, with the belief that in 2024 he would be working to develop new structures, discourse, tools, communities.

Our article is not limited in extent. It exceeds the "10 page limit" by probably 100 times and has a fuzzy boundary into the world's open knowledge. Nor is it limited in time; as soon as it is formally submitted that Word/PDF manuscript will be out of date as our community will be continually working on extensions, refinement, enhancement.

The best current metaphor for understanding/navigating the article is Wikimedia (technology). All components are semantic (structured, indexed, annotated, networked into a knowledge graph, and immediately visible) and are constantly updated with complete history and versioning. The Wikijournals (Science, Medicine) [] adopt this approach where the article uses all the knowledge tools and environment of the Wikimedia system. There is no technical reason why all scholarly publication should not adopt Wikimedia tools.

We also adopt Open Notebook Science philosophy [] where all our work is immediately available to the world ("no insider knowledge"). There is no universal toolkit for this, and since our components are scattered over authors and systems there is a delay and fragility is copying to the visible Internet. We wasted huge amounts of time in systems not suited for C21st dissemination; Ranganathan would have urged "Save the time of the author" and developed tools for that.

Our vision relies on complete Openness (see #FOW) - any friction makes processes longers, delayed, more complex and non-automatable. Much of our current practice uses closed systems for community and repositories. This causes friction (copying and maintenance). 

Closed Access and restrictive copyright are massive sources of friction in knowledge disseminatio. "Save the time of the reader" includes machines which cannot navigate dumb reference lists, ask for copyright permissions. Our vision in `pygetpapers` is that any amount  of the literature (often 10,000 articles) should be frictionlessly available to the human-machine symbiont reader. Much of the literature is not frictionless - closed or restrictive - and we deliberately ignore these.
