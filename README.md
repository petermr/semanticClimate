# #semanticClimate
Most other subjects have highly heterogeneous data without semantics and this holds back the creation of knowledge. There is a pressing need to make knowledge about climate available to mitigate the effects of gaseous emissions. The most important resource is the UN’s IPCC reports, published about every five years. In 2021-2022 AR6, with 10,000 pages, was released. #semanticClimate is a group of young Indian science students who are developing tools and community protocols to make IPCC AR6 semantic.

# Goals
* to convert the IPCC documents from PDF into (a) HTML (b) XML
* extract terms and explore their use and meaning
* link terms to [Wikidata](Wikidata.org) and create AMI-dictionaries
* create new structiures for navigation, search, display

# What #SemanticClimate does
We develop tools to liberate knowledge from locked PDFs and host events everybody gets a chance to explore the content in these reports through our tools. 
Our [Technical Strategy Page](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/ipcc/ar6/wg3#readme) gives an overview of the tools. 
# Upcoming Events
Check out our [Events page](/events.md) for details about upcoming hackathons we host and other events we are part of. 

# How to get involved
We are looking for volunteers/funders to: 
- run more events
- develop the code (open an Issue/PR to get started)
- develop the content (start a Discussion thread at https://github.com/petermr/petermr/discussions/)
   - dictionaries
   - semantified chapters
