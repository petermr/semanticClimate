<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that the most significant single impact of climate change will be in human migration events as humans will outnumber their local environments&#8217; carrying capacities. Typical estimates report that 200 million people are expected to become &#8220;climate refugees&#8221; by 2050 (nearly 3% of the world population, c.f. <xref rid="icab025-B163" ref-type="bibr">Brown 2008</xref>). As companion animals go where people go, we can also assume a higher proportion of companion animals will also be migrating with their owners. Long-distance transport is a direct stressor for companion animals. Dogs show behavioral and physiological markers of stress during ground and air transport (<xref rid="icab025-B164" ref-type="bibr">Bergeron et al. 2002</xref>). Cats are likely at an even higher risk of substantial distress as they show an acute stress response even to short-distance travel between the home and a veterinary clinic (<xref rid="icab025-B166" ref-type="bibr">Nibblett et al. 2015</xref>). Imported and transported animals may also bring &#8220;exotic&#8221; zoonotic diseases that are not endemic at destination communities (<xref rid="icab025-B180" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B181" ref-type="bibr">Polak 2019</xref>). For example, an increased movement of dogs, albeit shelter not pet dogs, from southern to northern Europe resulted in the introduction of new parasites (<xref rid="icab025-B110" ref-type="bibr">Otranto et al. 2017</xref>). Further, rabies is domestically controlled across many countries, but imported dogs may pose serious risk of introducing foreign variants, which can directly affect human health and cause the establishment of novel canine rabies strains (<xref rid="icab025-B172" ref-type="bibr">McQuiston et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
