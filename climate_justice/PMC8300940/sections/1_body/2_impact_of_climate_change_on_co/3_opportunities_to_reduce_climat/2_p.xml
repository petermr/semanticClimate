<p>Increasing ranges of parasites and infectious diseases threaten both animal and human health, and researchers have identified the role of both veterinary and medical practitioners in educating the public about related risks (<xref rid="icab025-B36" ref-type="bibr">Damborg et al. 2016</xref>). However, companion animal research is lacking in the area of emerging zoonoses in comparison to other facets of animal use. For example, there are global surveillance programs in place to track the emergence and prevalence of zoonoses in wildlife and livestock; the same surveillance measures in companion animals will likely be needed (<xref rid="icab025-B39" ref-type="bibr">Day et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B52" ref-type="bibr">Goni et al. 2018</xref>). The One Health paradigm emphasizes that the majority of emerging infectious diseases in humans will derive from animal reservoirs, although the focus of this pathway is mainly on livestock and wildlife (<xref rid="icab025-B177" ref-type="bibr">Overgaauw et al. 2020</xref>). However, companion animals can also serve as possible sources of zoonotic infections (<xref rid="icab025-B173" ref-type="bibr">Halliday et al. 2007</xref>). Pet ownership is a unique risk for zoonotic disease transfer due to the consistently close proximity of pets to humans. Over time, more dogs and cats are spending increased time indoors with their owners (<xref rid="icab025-B39" ref-type="bibr">Day et al. 2012</xref>), which may both increase risk to humans due to increased proximity, but also decrease risk due to increased vaccinations and sanitation. Because zoonosis falls at a distinctive intersection of human and animal health, it is crucial to understand the role of companion animals in this domain.</p>
