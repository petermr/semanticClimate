<p>Preserving the health of companion animals in a warming climate involves alterations in both owner behaviors as well as breeding practices. Aside from educating owners on the increased risks of leaving their pets in hot cars, more indirect opportunities may exist to safeguard animals. For example, obesity plays a key role in heat tolerance (<xref rid="icab025-B60" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al. 2020</xref>). Unfortunately, an estimate of 60% of companion animals in the United States are overweight or obese (<xref rid="icab025-B5" ref-type="bibr">APOP 2019</xref>) and are thus at a higher risk for heat-related medical concerns. Furthermore, whereas brachycephalic breeds, such as French bulldogs and Chow Chows, are highly popular, they are also at a higher risk for heatstroke (<xref rid="icab025-B38" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B60" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al. 2020</xref>). These risk factors are another reason to control the pet obesity epidemic and improve breeding practices to avoid phenotypes such as brachycephaly, which directly cause health and welfare concerns for individual animals (<xref rid="icab025-B85" ref-type="bibr">Ladlow et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B65" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B111" ref-type="bibr">Packer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B60" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
