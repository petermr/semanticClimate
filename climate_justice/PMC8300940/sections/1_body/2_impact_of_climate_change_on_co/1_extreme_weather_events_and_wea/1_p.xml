<p>Increasing warm weather&#8212;an outcome predicted to occur with high likelihood&#8212;has a direct impact on companion animal health. Several animal welfare organizations have already reported that incidences of dogs dying in hot cars are increasing (<xref rid="icab025-B18" ref-type="bibr">British Veterinary Association 2019</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B134" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al. 2019</xref>). Increase in warm temperature also has an alarming correlation with an increase in dog bites (<xref rid="icab025-B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al. 2019</xref>) and rabies infections in dogs (<xref rid="icab025-B84" ref-type="bibr">Lachica et al. 2020</xref>). An increase in droughts may also worsen the rabies epidemic as rabies infection has been negatively correlated with precipitation (<xref rid="icab025-B32" ref-type="bibr">Courtin et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B84" ref-type="bibr">Lachica et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
