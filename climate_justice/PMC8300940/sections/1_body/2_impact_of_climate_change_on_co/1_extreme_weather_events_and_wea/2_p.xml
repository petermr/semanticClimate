<p>One global impact of climate change is the increased spread of infectious diseases, including vector borne and zoonotic diseases (<xref rid="icab025-B53878789" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al. 2010</xref>). Climate change has allowed for the geographic range of vector species to expand or shift, thus exposing greater animal and human populations to diseases, as well as unknown emerging zoonoses (<xref rid="icab025-B53878789" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al. 2010</xref>). Similarly, climate change impacts the carrying capacity of ecosystems, which can alter the population density of host or vector species (<xref rid="icab025-B53878789" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al. 2010</xref>). Increasing warm weather has already been found to increase the prevalence of ticks and tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease (<xref rid="icab025-B92" ref-type="bibr">Lindgren and Gustafson 2001</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B55" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B44" ref-type="bibr">Estrada-Pe&#241;a et al. 2012</xref>). While Canada&#8217;s southern border was previously the northern extreme of the tick&#8217;s geographic range, surveillance of Lyme disease in humans and animals shows that climate warming contributes to the emergence of Lyme disease beyond previously known ranges (<xref rid="icab025-B107" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2019</xref>). Heartworm infections have also been found to vary according to climate and weather patterns (<xref rid="icab025-B102" ref-type="bibr">McGill et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B143" ref-type="bibr">Sz&#233;ll et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
