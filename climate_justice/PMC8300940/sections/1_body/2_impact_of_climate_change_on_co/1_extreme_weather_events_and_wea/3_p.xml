An increase in hot weather and extreme weather events may lead to a reduction of exercise opportunities for companion dogs (<xref rid="icab025-B129" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al. 2015</xref>), which may further exacerbate pet obesity (<xref rid="icab025-B74" ref-type="bibr">Hurley et al. 2011</xref>). As dog walking and other mutual activities improve the human&#8211;dog bond and may protect against behavioral problems, such as barking, hyperactivity, and aggression (<xref rid="icab025-B82" ref-type="bibr">Kobelt et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Rohlf 2007</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B35" ref-type="bibr">Curb et al. 2013</xref>), a decrease in walking opportunities may endanger the bond and lead to increased relinquishment of dogs to shelters.</p>
