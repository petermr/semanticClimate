<p>In this article, we follow the recommendations set forth in the Paris Agreement by first identifying how the impact of climate change directly and indirectly affects companion animals and the human&#8211;animal bond, and identifying how companion animals contribute to climate change. Second, we identify opportunities for mitigation and adaptation strategies to both prepare for the fallout of climate change as well as lessen the negative impacts of companion animals on climate change. Finally, we highlight features of successful and just adaptation plans as outlined by social scientists and end on a call to all companion animal professionals to actively consider their role in mitigating the impact of companion animals on the climate and preparing to adapt to the fallout of climate change.</p>
