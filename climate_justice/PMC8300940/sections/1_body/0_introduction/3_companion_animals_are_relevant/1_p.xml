<p>Companion animals play a significant role in society and the world economy. While global estimates of companion animals are unknown, in 2018 over 373 million cats and 471 million dogs were estimated to be kept as companion animals worldwide (<xref rid="icab025-B165" ref-type="bibr">Euromonitor 2019</xref>, as cited in <xref rid="icab025-B135" ref-type="bibr">Sivewright and Kreuger 2019</xref>). This is likely a considerable underestimation due to the number of unregistered animals, other companion animal species not being accounted for (e.g., birds, reptiles, and small mammals), and the continual rise of companion animal ownership (<xref rid="icab025-B99" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al. 2019</xref>). The number of free-roaming domestic dogs worldwide is an estimated 700 million to 1 billion (<xref rid="icab025-B72" ref-type="bibr">Hughes and Macdonald 2013</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B51" ref-type="bibr">Gompper 2014</xref> as cited in <xref rid="icab025-B142" ref-type="bibr">Sykes et al. 2020</xref>), and worldwide free-roaming cat population estimates are over 480 million (<xref rid="icab025-B23" ref-type="bibr">CAROcat 2021</xref>).</p>
