<p>Furthermore, companion animals and their care requirements likely contribute to climate change. As many households consider pets as family members, with some even reporting feeling closer to their pets than human family members (<xref rid="icab025-B12" ref-type="bibr">Barker and Barker 1988</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B152" ref-type="bibr">Walsh 2009a</xref>), owners spend substantial time and resources ensuring care for their companion animals. As such, owner behaviors have direct impacts on climate change. Production of companion animal food is considered a &#8220;neglected predictor of environmental damage&#8221; (<xref rid="icab025-B140" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. 2018</xref>). <xref rid="icab025-B108" ref-type="bibr">Okin (2017)</xref> estimated that, in the United States, cat and dog diets account for &#8764;30% of the environmental impacts of food production; however, on a global scale, these impacts are perhaps lower. While companion animal food was previously restricted to nonhuman-grade and waste products, a trend of &#8220;humanization&#8221; of pet food is occurring (<xref rid="icab025-B30" ref-type="bibr">Clemens 2014</xref>). Many guardians now prefer human-grade ingredients with high-animal protein content and may feed an excess of nutrients, further increasing the environmental impact (<xref rid="icab025-B141" ref-type="bibr">Swanson et al. 2013</xref>). In fact, shifting preferences currently make companion animal feed a direct competitor to human food consumption (<xref rid="icab025-B99" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al. 2019</xref>); a notable concern considering that climate change is increasing global food insecurity (<xref rid="icab025-B46" ref-type="bibr">FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO 2020</xref>).</p>
