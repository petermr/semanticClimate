<p>Furthermore, many researchers within the field of human&#8211;animal interaction work in close collaboration with their population communities conducting applied research and extension work, such as directly advising pet owners and members of the pet industry (dog trainers, animal shelter staff, pet food companies, etc.). Industry conferences invite scientific as well as industry perspectives. Therefore, companion animal scientists are in an ideal position to implement direct changes in current practices. Given that the translation and broad implementation of newly discovered scientific knowledge takes a substantial amount of time (<xref rid="icab025-B103" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al. 2011</xref>), already established working relationships between companion animal scientists and companion animal stakeholders are likely to reduce research-to-implementation time lags. Given the urgency of climate change, these already established relationships are a significant benefit.</p>
