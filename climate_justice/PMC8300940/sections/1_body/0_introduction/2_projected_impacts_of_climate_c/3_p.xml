At the same time, social injustices are expected to <italic toggle="yes">increase</italic> in the wake of climate change (<xref rid="icab025-B76" ref-type="bibr">Islam and Winkel 2017</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B40" ref-type="bibr">Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019</xref>).

Thus, responding to and preventing further social injustices is a crucial component of comprehensive climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>
