<p>Scientists predict that climate change will further escalate the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, leading to more disasters disrupting communities globally (<xref rid="icab025-B10" ref-type="bibr">Banholzer et al. 2014</xref>). For example, as a result of melting land ice and the expansion of warmer seawater, global sea level is expected to rise by 0.3&#8211;2.4&#8201;m by 2100, leading to increased flooding due to storm surges and high tides (<xref rid="icab025-B29" ref-type="bibr">Church and White 2011</xref>). Hurricanes in the North Atlantic are projected to become more intense and higher in frequency and duration (<xref rid="icab025-B15" ref-type="bibr">Bhatia et al. 2019</xref>). Higher temperatures are increasing the size and occurrence of wildfires, as well as lengthening the wildfire season in many areas (<xref rid="icab025-B24" ref-type="bibr">Cassell et al. 2019</xref>). By the end of the century, extreme heat events are expected to occur every few years (NASA, 2021).</p>
