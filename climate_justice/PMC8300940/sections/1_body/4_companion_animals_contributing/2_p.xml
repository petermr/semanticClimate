<p>Aside from feeding companion animals, other owner caretaking behaviors are also likely to have an environmental impact. For example, dog owners may use their personal car to bring their dog for exercise opportunities (e.g., walks in a natural area, dog parks, etc.; <xref rid="icab025-B101" ref-type="bibr">Mattioli et al. 2016</xref>). However, the transport sector accounts for more than a quarter of all energy use and produces substantial carbon dioxide emissions (<xref rid="icab025-B75" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2014</xref>). Furthermore, waste&#8212;especially plastic waste&#8212;is a rapidly increasing threat to global health due to its resistance to decomposition (<xref rid="icab025-B4" ref-type="bibr">Andrady 2011</xref>). Most animal care products, including food, toys, waste disposal bags, and veterinary medical supplies are composed of single-use plastics. Since 1950, over 7,800 million metric tonnes of plastics have been produced&#8212;over half of which occurred since 2004 (<xref rid="icab025-B49" ref-type="bibr">Geyer et al. 2017</xref>). Plastic pollution environments can have damaging physical impacts, such as animal entanglement (<xref rid="icab025-B48" ref-type="bibr">Gall and Thompson 2015</xref>) and habitat destruction (<xref rid="icab025-B131" ref-type="bibr">Sheavly and Register 2007</xref>). Plastic pollution also has chemical effects, with toxicity effects bioaccumulating up the food chain (<xref rid="icab025-B159" ref-type="bibr">Worm et al. 2017</xref>). However, the impacts of companion animal care on contributing to plastic pollution is not well studied&#8212;albeit with the estimated 99 billion USD pet industry (APPA 2021) in the United States alone, it is likely that pet toys and supplies are probable contributors to waste pollution.</p>
