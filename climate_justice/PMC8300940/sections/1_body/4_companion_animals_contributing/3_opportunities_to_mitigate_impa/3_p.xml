<p>Reduction refers to a strategy of fewer animals being used when possible. In the United States, &#8764;38% of households own dogs and 25% own cats, with an average of 1.6 dogs and 1.8 cats per household (AVMA 2021). Reduction of the number of animals kept as companions could reduce the EPP of companion animal care (<xref rid="icab025-B99" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al. 2019</xref>). Reduction strategies may include sharing ownership of animals across multiple families, adopting existing animals rather than breeding new animals, and having temporary ownership such as fostering or pet sitting arrangements. Programs that target reducing free ranging populations, where harmful to people or the environment, may also be considered within this strategy. For example, humane Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return programs for feral cats have been successful in certain contexts to reduce overall numbers of community cats that may be harmful to biodiversity (c.f. <xref rid="icab025-B33" ref-type="bibr">Crawford et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B128" ref-type="bibr">Schaffner et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
