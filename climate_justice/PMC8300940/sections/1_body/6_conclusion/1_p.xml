<p>Climate change has been recognized as the most urgent matter impacting human society. Companion animals impact and are impacted by the changing climate through their intrinsically linked relationships with people. And, companion animal scientists, who are often generalists and systems thinkers, are in an ideal position to address these impacts. As examples, we identified several climate change outcomes, such as warming temperature, migration of people, increases in disasters, crises, and human inequities, and attempted to connect these outcomes to already identified and hypothesized impacts on companion animals and the human&#8211;animal relationship. We also summarized how companion animals and owners&#8217; caretaking behaviors are impacting climate change through the use of finite natural resources as well as pollution and carbon emissions. We end on some considerations on creating mitigation and adaptation plans with a focus on equity, sustainability, respect for animal health and welfare, and measurability as key features.</p>
