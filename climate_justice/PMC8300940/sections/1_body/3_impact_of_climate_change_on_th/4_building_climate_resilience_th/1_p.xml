<p>Racism, poverty, and other structural inequities are insipid and undermine the human&#8211;animal bond. Studies of racial disparities and companion animal welfare are sparse and primarily confined to the United States. Racial discrimination in housing and pet restrictions were also recently reported (<xref rid="icab025-B122" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al. 2020</xref>) and another study found that police shootings of dogs cluster in low-income communities of color (<xref rid="icab025-B16" ref-type="bibr">Bloch and Mart&#237;nez 2020</xref>). A lack of racial diversity in US animal welfare volunteers has been reported (<xref rid="icab025-B106" ref-type="bibr">Neumann 2010</xref>) and the reasoning for underrepresentation of Black Americans in animal welfare has been explored via semi-structured interviews (<xref rid="icab025-B19" ref-type="bibr">Brown 2005</xref>). Social injustices are inextricably linked to climate change, and without immediate action will only worsen. Thus, we must get better at incorporating systemic social issues into our work. When we consider the intersection of social justice issues and companion animal science, an obvious starting place is animal sheltering. Animal sheltering and associated services touch the lives of most members in a community. Within its purview, animal services may provide necessary veterinary care for animals, reunite families with lost pets, enforce local, state, and federal laws concerning welfare and containment, and are side-by-side with first responders in a myriad of situations including during mental health crises (e.g., hoarding), paramedic emergencies (e.g., a car accident with a pet present), and in response to criminal activity (e.g., when a person&#8217;s pet is present during an apprehension in the community). Because of this breadth of work, there are ample opportunities to examine and improve procedures to ensure that these government agencies will serve all community members with equity and justice.</p>
