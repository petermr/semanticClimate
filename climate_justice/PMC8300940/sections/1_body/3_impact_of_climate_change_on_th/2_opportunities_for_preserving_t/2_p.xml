<p>Although pet ownership creates an increased risk during disasters, companion animals simultaneously increase resilience for humans (<xref rid="icab025-B145" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2014</xref>). Companion animals reduce distress associated with traumatic events, and the human&#8211;animal bond can act as a strong support following disasters (<xref rid="icab025-B144" ref-type="bibr">Thompson 2013</xref>). The strength of the human&#8211;companion animal bond therefore warrants proper consideration during disaster preparation and management. Continued research on the human&#8211;companion animal relationship during crises will certainly serve to better prepare for impacts of future pandemics and other disasters.</p>
