<p>In response to previous major disasters, new measures have been introduced to protect companion animals and owners in the future: because of the fallout from Hurricane Katrina, the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act in the United States now requires provisioning of pet-friendly shelters after a disaster (<xref rid="icab025-B176" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al. 2020</xref>). However, research on pet-related disaster planning is mainly limited to the Anglosphere, and research and policy implementation are still needed globally. For example, approximately 10,000 owned dogs were reported dead after the 2011 earthquakes in Japan (<xref rid="icab025-B171" ref-type="bibr">Yamazaki 2015</xref>). Furthermore, there must be greater considerations for companion animals during disasters in at risk areas, such as those with greater vulnerable human and animal populations. For instance, the Philippines, a highly disaster-prone country due to its location, also has a high population of free ranging dogs, which could place further risks to both humans and animals during times of disaster (<xref rid="icab025-B178" ref-type="bibr">Davlin et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B179" ref-type="bibr">De Leon and Pittock 2017</xref>). And finally, countries around the world will have to consider their distinctive natural and social environments, as communities will ultimately be impacted differently by the increasing threat of disasters due to climate change.</p>
