<p>Disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding are likely to increase in frequency (<xref rid="icab025-B10" ref-type="bibr">Banholzer et al. 2014</xref>). The strength of the human&#8211;animal bond is particularly evident during times of disaster, where pet owners often choose to risk their own lives to save animals from fires, floods, and hurricanes (<xref rid="icab025-B144" ref-type="bibr">Thompson 2013</xref>). Even though previous events outline the importance of pet-related planning during disasters, very few governments&#8217; disaster plans incorporate companion animals. For pet owners, dealing with disasters is contingent on decision making about not only themselves, but also the animals in their households (<xref rid="icab025-B148" ref-type="bibr">Travers et al. 2017</xref>). Research shows that pet ownership increases risk of evacuation noncompliance and unauthorized early re-entry attempts. Evacuation noncompliance not only creates risks to both the pet owner and the animal, but also to emergency response teams in the community (<xref rid="icab025-B27" ref-type="bibr">Chadwin 2017</xref>). Difficult decisions during emergencies and natural disasters elevate risk for pet owners, their animals, and the community, indicating that the human&#8211;animal bond should not be trivialized when planning for these events.</p>
