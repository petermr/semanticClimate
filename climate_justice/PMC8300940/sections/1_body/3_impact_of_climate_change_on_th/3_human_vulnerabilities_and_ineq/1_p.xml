<p>Emergency decisions during disasters are shaped by external forces, meaning that the effects of disasters on pet owners are even greater when coupled with other vulnerabilities. Structural factors such as community disaster preparedness, proximity to human and animal emergency services, availability of transportation, and knowledge about disasters can impact responses (<xref rid="icab025-B45" ref-type="bibr">Every et al. 2016</xref>). On top of that, social factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status can contribute to further vulnerability during and following disasters (<xref rid="icab025-B145" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2014</xref>). For example, older adults are less likely to have the ability to drive, which decreases the likelihood of being able to access nearby animal shelters (<xref rid="icab025-B41" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al. 2019</xref>). Minority and immigrant populations are more vulnerable to disasters due to lack of access to disaster-related information in a native language, including those pertaining to pet evacuation (<xref rid="icab025-B100" ref-type="bibr">Mathew and Kelly 2008</xref>). Individuals experiencing poverty may face additional financial barriers, as some pet-friendly evacuation shelters require pets to be recently vaccinated prior to entry (<xref rid="icab025-B41" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al. 2019</xref>). Some may not own sufficient carriers for their pets to evacuate safely, which has been identified as a significant hindrance to the evacuation process (<xref rid="icab025-B68" ref-type="bibr">Heath et al. 2001</xref>). Following disasters, pet owners who live in rental dwellings face serious difficulties finding pet-friendly rentals, and may end up needing to relinquish their animals or live in unsafe dwellings to keep their pets (<xref rid="icab025-B31" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B54" ref-type="bibr">Graham and Rock 2019</xref>).</p>
