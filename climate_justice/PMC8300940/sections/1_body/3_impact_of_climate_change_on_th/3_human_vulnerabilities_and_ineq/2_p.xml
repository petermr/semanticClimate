<p>With increased competition for natural resources, migration of human populations across the globe, and growing political unrest (<xref rid="icab025-B161" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2007a</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B98" ref-type="bibr">Marchiori and Schumacher 2011</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B155" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler and Von Braun 2013</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B104" ref-type="bibr">Nardulli et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B71" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B77" ref-type="bibr">Janssens et al. 2020)</xref>, the resulting expected increase in human inequities and injustices will doubtless affect companion animal ownership. Veterinarians report that access to veterinary care is one of the main challenges for pet health in North America (<xref rid="icab025-B87" ref-type="bibr">LaVallee et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B64" ref-type="bibr">Harding 2018</xref>). Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to have regular visits to their veterinarians and experience pet care deserts (<xref rid="icab025-B47" ref-type="bibr">Fung et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B136" ref-type="bibr">Spencer et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B147" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al. 2019</xref>). Likewise, human vulnerabilities predicted increased risk of surrendering animals for owner-related reasons and surrendering animals that were not considered healthy upon intake (<xref rid="icab025-B94" ref-type="bibr">Ly et al. 2021</xref>). Furthermore, whereas most diseases affecting companion animals are not commonly transmitted to healthy humans, immunocompromised individuals face a higher risk of developing any zoonosis (<xref rid="icab025-B28" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2008</xref>); due to the link between poverty and health, the most at-risk individuals may be the least informed about risks of zoonotic disease transmission (<xref rid="icab025-B137" ref-type="bibr">Steele and Mor 2015</xref>).</p>
