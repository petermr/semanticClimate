<p>Adaptation strategies must strive to not negatively impact the environment and thus, not contribute to the changing climate. Fear of emerging zoonotic disease may increase the use of antibiotics and thus protect the health of human and nonhuman animals in the short-term but is also likely to significantly harm long-term public health through increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance&#160;(AMR)&#8212;an example of an unsustainable plan of action. Plans must also respect animal health and welfare. For example, the promotion of alternative diets, such as vegetarian diets, by companion animals may be beneficial in GHG emissions, but may also present animal health risks (e.g., <xref rid="icab025-B79" ref-type="bibr">Kanakubo et al. 2015</xref>). This presents an opportunity for collaboration between researchers in animal health, veterinarians, and climate scientists, given the veterinary field&#8217;s expressed interest, but perceived lack of opportunity, to address climate change in their work (<xref rid="icab025-B83" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B117" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
