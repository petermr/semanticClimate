<p>Because the human&#8211;animal bond is profound (<xref rid="icab025-B152" ref-type="bibr">Walsh 2009a</xref>, <xref rid="icab025-B153" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>), mitigation and adaptation plans must aim to keep owners and their animals together. When considering plans involving companion animals, their considerable value in our lives must be recognized. An example of a plan that would not pass the mark may be programs to eradicate free ranging populations of urban animals, such as dogs. Whereas reducing populations of urban animals may ameliorate concerns of zoonotic diseases, these programs must be implemented only with the backing of the target communities. A devastating example of a harmful approach is capturing and rehoming free ranging dogs in Indigenous communities in Canada. This has been done repeatedly and without permission, with &#8220;rescuers&#8221; unaware or indifferent to the reality that these dogs were community-owned, cared for, and culturally important. This blatant stealing caused direct harm to owners and sabotaged working relationships between Indigenous communities and other animal welfare advocates (<xref rid="icab025-B17" ref-type="bibr">Bressette 2020</xref>).</p>
