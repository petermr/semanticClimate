<p>A final, crucial aspect of an adaptation plan is that the impact is measurable (<xref rid="icab025-B59" ref-type="bibr">Haasnoot et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="icab025-B109" ref-type="bibr">Olazabal et al. 2019</xref>). The hypothesized increase in community resilience following the implementation of the plan must be measured and reported, and if insufficient progress is demonstrated, amended. Social and climate scientists designed several high-level approaches that may be utilized to create adaptation plans, but all plans tell us to focus on immediate identified needs and amend when new needs or deficiencies are discovered (<xref rid="icab025-B59" ref-type="bibr">Haasnoot et al. 2018</xref>). Thus, we do not need to succumb to inaction caused by future uncertainties of climate change and the overwhelming amount of work that needs to be done, but instead focus on what is just in front of us and needs doing.</p>
