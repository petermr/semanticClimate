<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0290">We believe an integrated climate change curriculum in medical education and similar health professional studies would enhance training quality, build leadership skills, and address some workforce shortages by better preparing providers for disasters and climate-sensitive conditions. Material should be cross-cutting as the health impacts of climate change affect every organ system. This approach may serve as a foundation for developing a professional climate lens whereby in clinical years and as specific areas of interest develop, climate change is incorporated into scholarly work and clinical practice. The approach would support recommendations to improve medical education and population health in Africa [<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and could easily be incorporated into the most up-to-date pedagogical format [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
