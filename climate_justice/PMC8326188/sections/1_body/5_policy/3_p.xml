<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0325">National policies can scale research and scientific evidence to better prepare and respond to extreme weather events. This will be particularly important with projected increases in disasters that harm those most vulnerable [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and as population growth and urbanisation increase exposure [<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Specific policies that strengthen public health infrastructure and technology [<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], develop the ECS [<xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and provide workforce training may in fact meaningfully begin to address the global burden of diseases and injuries resulting from climate change, along with global efforts in mitigation.</p>
