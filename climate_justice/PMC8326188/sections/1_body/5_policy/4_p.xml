Existing professional organisations working to strengthen healthcare in Africa, AFEM, International Federation for Emergency Medicine, Consortium for Universities for Global Health, among other international organisations, have the ability to leverage their influence and professional member influence to participate in international mitigation, adaptation, and resilience building efforts, as well as prioritise financial and human resources to best meet the needs of people most vulnerable to the effects of climate change on the continent. The participants in the pre-conference proposed a Declaration on Climate Change and Health (Appendix). The Declaration will be submitted for commentary and adoption to AFEM and other regional organisations ready to outline their commitments to a healthier future.</p>
