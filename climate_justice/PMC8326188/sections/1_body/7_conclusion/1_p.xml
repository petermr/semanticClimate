<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0345">Climate change and health represents a new landscape for global health collaboration for emergency care professionals and researchers. And, it lays a novel foundation for sustained academic and community partnerships. Health professionals in Africa have an opportunity to lead their nations in climate change adaptation and resilience. Competing priorities, governance, and a global pandemic are potential barriers but also a moment to choose a transformed path of justice and health for those in leadership positions. As emergency centres are increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change, leadership by emergency care professionals will be essential to guide their patients, colleagues, facilities and emergency care systems in preparing and responding to meet the challenges.</p>
