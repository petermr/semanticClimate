<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0270">This description represents the first workshop to explore the intersection of climate change and health at the AfCEM. There was clear interest in the topic by participants and recognition of the health impacts as well as opportunities to enhance health professional education. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the representation of this cohort as self-selected workshop participants willing to engage with the climate change issue. However, local workshop participants strongly signalled their support of the relevance of the topic to a wider range of African emergency care practitioners.</p>
