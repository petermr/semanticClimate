As a first step, researchers should begin to measure the association between climate related impacts and health related outcomes at the national, subnational, and facility level. Additional ongoing research on emergency care in Africa can incorporate factors specific to climate change. Future studies should seek to elucidate provider and health systems &#8216;readiness for change&#8217; and status for engagement in larger process improvement efforts to combat the effects of and prepare the effects of climate change. Lastly, research should be developed on the pragmatic implementation of interventions aimed at mitigating the worst effects of climate change on emergency care service delivery and health.</p>
