<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0225">Founded in 2009, the African Federation for Emergency Medicine (AFEM) represents a coalition of societies, organisations, and members from more than 40 countries across the continent aimed at supporting the development of emergency care. For the last 9&#160;years, AFEM has sponsored a biennial conference, the African Conference for Emergency Medicine (AfCEM) held in rotating African countries. AfCEM is Africa's largest and most widely attended emergency care event for research, education and networking. Collaborative global work that supports high-quality emergency care, including the development of emergency care systems, forms the foundation for the AFEM model [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which includes leadership development, advocacy, collaboration, research, education and training, and policies and frameworks. Climate change and health substantively intersects across the six components of the AFEM model and highlights opportunities for enhanced leadership in climate action among emergency providers. To focus on this opportunity, AfCEM 2020 was the first to include a full one-day workshop devoted to climate change, health and emergency care in Africa.</p>
