<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0215">Health care professionals are increasingly aware of the health effects of climate change, and have helped to drive recent advances in education, research, and national and international policies [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Their perspectives on the local health impacts, vulnerabilities to extreme weather events, and potential solutions make them valued patient advocates and drivers of policy change. Health professionals can be crucial voices in government, non-governmental organisations, and professional societies with measurable spheres of influence, incorporating a &#8220;health in all policies&#8221; approach and advancing the broader field of planetary health [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Emergency care providers, in particular, are experienced in caring for critically ill patients with climate-sensitive conditions such as those in respiratory distress from asthma exacerbations due to atmospheric particulate matter [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Emergency centres are also relied upon by communities during times of climate-related disasters: floods, cyclones, wildfires, extreme heat, droughts, dust storms. In 2019, nearly 100 million people were affected by disasters, 97% of those were secondary to climate and weather-related disasters [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Typical emergent conditions as well as injuries and patterns of disease more prevalent during times of disaster make preparedness imperative to responding to meet surges in demand. Emergency professionals recognise these complex needs as frontline care providers in their communities. Similarly, the World Health Organization recognises the importance of timely care for the acutely ill and injured as a human right [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
