Estimates suggest that loss of healthy life years from climate change are predicted to be up to 500 times greater in Africa than in Europe [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increasing malnutrition, traumatic injuries, disease exacerbations of chronic illnesses, mental health effects, and changing infectious disease burdens represent some of the many ways climate change negatively impacts human health in Africa [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Climate change will also likely lead to increasing extreme weather events in the region with increasing negative consequences from both direct and indirect threats to health. Water scarcity and other stressors affect basic sanitation and infection control in community and health care settings [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, cyclones Idai and Kenneth in March and April 2019 led to increased morbidity and mortality in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi from the secondary effects of cholera outbreaks, housing instability, and loss of access to food and health care services [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
