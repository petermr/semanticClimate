Even more, the effects of a changing climate are not distributed equally. While all nations are threatened, specific communities and regions are at increased risk of adverse health effects due to exposure and underlying vulnerabilities [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Those most at risk are nations and individuals with fewer resources and less adaptive capacity, leading to projected significant exacerbations of existing health inequities [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Countries in Africa are particularly susceptible due to location, climate-sensitive diseases, and socioeconomic disparities [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
