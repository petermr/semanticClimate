The question of &#8220;how much is enough&#8221; gets even more interesting if one were to explore future climate change investment and finance needs and priorities. The UNEP Finance Initiative estimates that the costs of the transition to low carbon and climate-resilient economies will need an investment of $60 trillion between 2017 and 2050 (Shine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>), while the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>) concludes that $89 trillion or about $6 trillion annually is likely to be needed between 2015 and 2030 to achieve the more ambitious goal of low carbon emissions and climate resiliency in cities, energy systems, and in other sectors.</p>
