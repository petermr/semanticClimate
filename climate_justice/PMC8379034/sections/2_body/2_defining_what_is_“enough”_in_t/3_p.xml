Seven multilateral climate funds were responsible for $11.7 billion for 967 projects between 2001 and 2016 and helped mobilize more than$70 billion in additional financing from the private sector and other sources (Amerasinghe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>). If one were to use a broader measure of climate change investment and finance flows to include a wide range of public, private, and public&#8211;private initiatives (e.g., electric utility investing in a green grid project), climate change investment and finance flows would reach $612 billion in 2017 (Buchner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>).</p>
