Using a political ecology framework, Checker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) analyzes the hidden costs as well as the contradictions of New York City&#8217;s ambitious green real estate and sustainable business development agenda, while DuPuis and Greenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>) question whether the framing of such issues as &#8220;climate resiliency&#8221; and public&#8211;private partnership might unintentionally lead to a pro-business development agenda at the expense of low-income, vulnerable community members.</p>
