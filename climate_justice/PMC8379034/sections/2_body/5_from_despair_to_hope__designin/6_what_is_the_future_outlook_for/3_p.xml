Climate change justice scholarship has traditionally been shaped by the perspectives of philosophical and environmental ethics (Jamieson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>) examining climate change in the context of historic and current carbon emissions or from the perspectives of sociology (Roberts and Parks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>) discussing how social movements have united and gained traction under the climate change policy umbrella. While the role of business in global climate change governance is growing in the academic literature (see Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref> and Paterson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>), and extensively in the policy literature (e.g., World Economic Forum, Business for Social Responsibility, among others), what has been traditionally been missing in both the academic and the policy research literature is the explicit focus on climate change justice and the role it can and needs to play at the nexus of climate change governance and investment/finance (Gifford and Knudson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>).</p>
