(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>) argue that France and Germany are paying their fair share of climate finance, while the USA contributed just 7% of its fair share in 2017&#8211;2018. If one used a more stringent definition of climate finance, Colenbrander et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>) estimate that Germany, Japan, and the UK are paying 40&#8211;45% of their fair share, while Australia, Canada, and the USA contributed less than 5% of their fair share in 2017&#8211;2018.</p>
