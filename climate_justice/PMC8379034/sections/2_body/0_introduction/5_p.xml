While these measures will no doubt help climate change and SDG financing indirectly (e.g., by reducing climate-related risks in investment and project financing), Mitchell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2021</xref>) estimate that if one were to analyze the progress made since the pledge at the 2009 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference in Copenhagen (and affirmed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement) by developed countries to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance, only $43 billion or less than half in &#8220;new and additional&#8221; total development finance (including flows from official aid, multilateral contributions, and less-concessional finance, including export credits) has materialized.</p>
