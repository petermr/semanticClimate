<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par19">Consequently, only 7% of the total climate investment and finance flows went to adaptation activities in 2016, while 93% of the total climate finance flows went to fund climate mitigation activities (Oliver et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). Although adaptation finance rose significantly to $30 billion in the 2017&#8211;2018 time period, a 35% increase from 2015&#8211;2016 levels, adaptation finance is still significantly short of what is needed worldwide (Buchner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>). Because climate change investment and finance flows tend to stay within the same country and region (that is, German companies tend to invest in solar energy projects based in Germany or within the European Union), the investment flow tilts toward climate mitigation activities has particularly negative consequences for economically insecure, investment capital scarce countries in the developing world.</p>
