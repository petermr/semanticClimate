In relation to the migratory effect caused by climate change, since 2016 there has been an increase in the number of articles that use the term climate justice, defined as the imperative need to include the environmental dimension in all decision-making (regardless of the corresponding discipline), with a legal framework that allows action to be taken in the event that this dimension is not taken into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the scientific literature, there are several works that relate climate justice to climate change-induced migration, such as the research by Ajibade et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], who emphasise the importance of differentiating climate migration from managed retreat to enhance climate justice, or the study by Ahmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] focused on identifying the responsibility of climate refugees.</p>
