# OPEN NOTE BOOK AND SEMENTIFICATION

## HISTORY

[PMR] 11:17:02 : And this part is going to deal with the technology of creating, semantic material automatically from non-semantic material.

[PMR] 11:17:14 : But I just want to say a little bit about the history and, where what we're doing fits into.

[PMR] 11:17:23 : The general development of information. Now, what we are doing is actually quite Revolutionary. But, it is built from a concept which was popularized by Vannevar Bush in 1,945. So that's, 80 years ago.

[PMR] 11:17:54 : And he came up with the idea of a device called the Memex. Which would store everything that went on books, records, communications as fast as possible.

[PMR] 11:18:50 : Within a convenient file card system there are individual cards that you write on, that's called a filing card system 

[PMR] 11:19:04 : And That is how, library catalogues were organized. And how many of them still are organized. So if you go into some libraries you'll find massive cabinets which consist of file cards and that's really influenced Rangannathan in his faceted Classification. Now, Bush was later, 1945, and he came up with the idea of something which would record everything you did.That was a, High dream, for, some, time, but then, and he came up with a fanciful machine.

[PMR] 11:20:30 : So the idea here is to come up with something that records everything and makes it easy and natural to find anything you want. And people been working on this for 50 Or more years.

## OPEN NOTEBOOK SCIENCE

[PMR] 11:20:55 : Now. The other thing I want to talk about is recording at source. So what we do, is we use something called Open Notebook science.

[PMR] 11:21:20 : This was pioneered by Donco Bradley. And it is the practice of making the entire primary record of a research project publicly available online As it is recorded. So. It was promoted by, Jean Claude Bradley, and actually, he was going to call it open science, but I persuaded him to call it open notebook science.

[PMR] 11:21:53 : And, this was so important, that, He was honored by President Obama.He died tragically young and I and others organized a memorial. Symposium in Cambridge to honor his legacy

[PMR] 11:22:23 : So, his idea is that everything you do is available to the whole world as you do it and we have been, taking that idea, and trying to put it into practice. It's difficult mainly because the tools don't exist and because the culture needs changing.

[PMR] 11:22:47 : People are trained in universities very often to keep everything. To themselves, particularly if they're going to be assessed and researchers, have the culture that the primary purpose of research is to compete against other researchers.

[PMR] 11:23:06 : So open notebook science It's taking a long time to Develop. But at least the preprint culture is part of the way the towards it.

## PROBLEM WITH PUBLICATION

[PMR] 11:23:20 : The problem we have in publication at the moment and Rangannason would undoubtedly have had, things to say about this is that you create your primary record, let's say in a laboratory notebook where you write it in or type it in and you collect data off an instrument and then, you transcribe this to paper, often with loss of information ; both mistakes and omissions and then you published the paper which is a snapshot of that research.

[PMR] 11:24:04 : Now we know that what we're doing is dynamic. So we are doing this day by day. We're capturing it day by day and a snapshot does not give the totality. So, current message of static publication do not capture the full dynamic range of what we're doing.


## CREATION OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION

[PMR] 11:24:30 : So having said that, I now want to move on to the technical details as to how we create, semantic information.

[PMR] 11:24:41 : We are not doing experiments. We are, creating recordings, Talks, Software and so on and as far as possible we're doing that under the open notebook for philosophy. That is that people have access to it as soon as it is created. 

[PMR] 11:25:16 : Github has that, facility so that as soon as you create a piece of software. You, Upload it to a public repository usually with only a a delay of about, a day or something of that sort. And that was very much the ethos of the human genome project, which, worked on the basis that all sequences they collected were uploaded to sample repositories by the end of the day.


[PMR] 11:25:40 : And that's one of the great, examples of open the notebook science. It's actually predated the term. It was called the Bermuda protocol. And it's a milestone.

[PMR] 11:25:58 : It's a great pity that we have moved to the situation where people are obsessed with measuring their performance with metrics and those metrics are controlled by the publishers and the publishers have no interest in open notebook science or anything open. So. That's something which will need to be built into the system in the future.

[PMR] 11:26:31 : So when Doing what we can with that, but our main activity of semantic output is, the different windows we have on climate.

[PMR] 11:26:45 : We have, PYGET papers and dock analysis. Which allow us to search the literature recently this has been extended with open Alex.And, we can search. Tens of millions of scholarly articles for climate information.

[PMR] 11:27:13 : We can normally retrieve the metadata for that, and in some cases we can automatically record the PDF or in cases where it's been published fully open in the Pubmed Central System, we're able to read the XML as well.

[PMR] 11:27:39 : That's semi semantic in that the document has semantic structure, but for the body of the worK it doesn't have semantic labeling, on the components..

[PMR] 11:27:54 : But we are working on, making that more and more semantic labeling paragraphs, so on and that's available in the output of dock analysis, and Aimee that's a fully semantic, Structurally but not necessarily annotated with a schema which is universal.

# UN MATERIAL

## FCCC REPORTS

[PMR] 11:28:23 : Then we have, the, FCCC reports. And again, that's lower priority than the IPCC material at the moment.

[PMR] 11:28:34 : But the FCCC reports are a list of several 100 Pdf documents that are not semantic.

[PMR] 11:28:56 : They have no markup and no annotation, but they are written in a consistent format. So we're able to essentially build a template or the IPCC and turn that into something with a considerable degree of That's semantic.

[PMR] 11:29:17 : Macro and micro structure and with some of the terms Identified and labeled. But the main enhancement of that comes with our ability to search the generated HTML and to link that into our glossary system. So we'll come to the IPCC glossary..

## IPCC GLOSSARY

[PMR] 11:29:46 : Now glossary is absolutely essential to and adding, and understanding and markup. The terms that are used are glossary, Dictionary and sometimes the source and so on. We use the word dictionary, but it is a very loose term and it allows supportive glossary operations. So the IPCC call that. Now, the IPCC glossary..

[PMR] 11:30:28 : It is available in PDF form. I think I have to check that. But it's available in a rather inaccessible, HTML, form.

[PMR] 11:30:44 : It has entries for each term, which are separate downloads. So I'll just have a look and see if we can find IPCC.

[PMR] 11:31:15 : So if we were interested in which we saw earlier today. You click on that and it gives the definition and the parent but this is in HTML which is not easily downloadable and because it's served by a server which requires some intelligence on the research. Receiving and So, Ayush Garg again, was able to, write, headless browser tool that allows us to download all of this automatically.

[PMR] 11:32:03 : The results of this are about 700 terms, which, are available in that sort of form some of which have been put into the glossary that Simon Worthington has transformed into semantic HTML.

[PMR] 11:32:26 : So that's glossary. Now that glossary is a universal glossary for all the reports.

## INDIVIDUAL GLOSSARY

[PMR] 11:32:36 : But there are also individual glossaries for Chapters.  So if I go into IPCC WG 3 glossary , we have an annex. And this glossary here. Is a PDF file. So that you see, it's got to be transformed into something more useful and it does not overlap. It's overlaps a lot with that.

[PMR] 11:33:18 : Communal glossary, but it does have terms which are not in the communal glossary. So by downloading all the glossaries or the individual chapters we can enhance that central glossary. And we're doing so as well. And then the other thing that some of the reports but not all of them do. Is they give abbreviations, Annexes, Glossary and I think that's PDF. Acronyms, that's it.

## ACRONYMS

[PMR] 11:34:09 : So if we look at acronyms, this is PDF and these are the acronyms which are particularly relevant to WG 3 .

[PMR] 11:34:32 : So , 50 acronyms a page. And we've got about 7 or 8 pages. So we've got a few 100 acronyms and if we collect together all the acronyms. that we've got from the various working groups then we'll be able to have something which is much larger.

[PMR] 11:34:59 : But you see this one WG 3 doesn't have a marker in it. I'll have a quick look and see whether anything in WG 1 .

[PMR] 11:35:34 : This is, I find extremely difficult to navigate.

## ADDING TERMS TO THE GLOSSARY

[PMR] 11:36:02 : I don't see anything there about acronyms at all. So each report is different but, we can hopefully between us now, collect all that together. So I expect at our glossary consists of Probably about 1,500 terms, that, there will be probably an additional, 3 or 400 acronyms which are not. In those terms. And so we're going to end up with somewhere around about 2

[PMR] 11:36:46 : And we will automatically look them up in Wikipedia and wiki data wherever possible.

[PMR] 11:36:55 : So that's a glossary. The glossary is there to inform us, but it's also there to create search term so that, we will probably, go through the process of, adding regular expression search terms.


[PMR] 11:37:12 : To many of the terms in the glossary. The good thing is it's a static glossary, so we probably only need to do it.

[PMR] 11:37:22 : Okay, that's, the glossary. Then. I've talked about the FCCC, haven't I? I just want to say that we can use the glossary to search the FCCC. And, add, semantic meaning to the term

[PMR] 11:37:43 : So if it contains something like I don't know. In there anywhere then, we can link this to.


## IPCC CHAPTERS
[PMR] 11:37:56 : And then finally we come to the IPCC chapters. The IPCC chapters are primarily made available in PDF.

[PMR] 11:38:10 : So if we go into let's say WG 1 and we go to downloads. 

[PMR] 11:38:52 : These are chapter in PDF. But if you go to the Explore button here this is the HTML and you will see it contains expand and contract sections. Now to get that down, we have to use a headless browser, which Ayush created and it's possible to download all those reports in full, with the headless browser technology. So we work mainly from the HTML and not from the PDF.

[PMR] 11:39:42 : When we've got the HTML, what we then, need to do is to make it semantic.
 

[PMR] 11:40:29 : sometimes we go down to Sub sub sections . Some of them are more deeply nested than other

## FIGURES

[PMR] 11:40:45 : This is a figure. So we can get down the figures and the captions to the figures are really important here.

[PMR] 11:40:53 : And one or 2 other things to note. Is that there are some hyperlinks here. So pointing into sections.

[PMR] 11:41:01 : And at the end of some of them there are links to other.

## NAVIGATING IPCC CHAPTERS 

[PMR] 11:41:16 : These are links, sometimes to references. Cross chapter box. And here you can see we've actually got a link to another section.

[PMR] 11:41:34 : Not very easy to navigate, is it? So we try and honor all of these sections here and make it easy to navigate. So we have semantic. Labelling for all of the parts and if I go into on these here.

[PMR] 11:42:19 : So the paragraphs will be numbered paragraph 1 to 7, and the box will be, labeled with its particular identifire here, which should be universal across the system. So, what we're immediately offering is a navigation system. That. As far as I know, nobody else offered and it will should be much easier to use. Than the HTML you've got here..

[PMR] 11:42:55 : We've got some work to do on that because, this is, if we open this up you will see that this has got. Gatsby display markup. So that doesn't have any semantic meaning.

[PMR] 11:43:24 : Gatsby focus wrapper. Has no meaning in terms of climate change. And so on and many of these can probably be ignored.

[PMR] 11:43:37 : But when we finally come down to sections here. We've got, titles here which That tells what the various sections are.

[PMR] 11:43:54 : So we will have a semi-smantic. A set of components from the IPCC chapters and that's probably that and the glossary are our main thrusts at the moment.

[PMR] 11:44:12 : The pyget paper stuff will come. And but, the drawback to that is. And that we have to do more work on the actual content.
 
## THE THREE MAIN SECTIONS

[PMR] 11:44:33 : We've got 3 Main sections. We've got the introduction about climate change and, Oh, we've got a main body about, and all of the components.

[PMR] 11:44:49 : What they are and then at the end we've got a technical section on how we analyze this and make these semantification automatic. Simon is talking about all the social aspects of semantic climate.  there..

[PMR] 11:45:09 : So are comments or questions in particular what have I missed out?

[Renu Kumari] 11:45:19 : So basically, you're not just, talked about the amilib and amiclimate.

## AMILIB 
[PMR] 11:45:25 : Yep, well done. We're going to, we're going to talk about that. So we talked about what we were going to do but not how we were going to do it.

[PMR] 11:45:35 : So Our software, so this is another section, our software, is developed in a modular fashion.

[PMR] 11:45:51 : And here I'm going to show my pycharm. Display of this. There is a general component called Amy Lib.  And, it is a collection of libraries. Which are generally useful for documents and analysis , classification, sementification. Reuse and republicate. So they apply to any set of documents.

[PMR] 11:46:26 : In principle. Without going through all of them We have something that deals with the bibliography.Tools that deal with CSV. I've recently added a tool which supports dictionaries so that we can create dictionaries easily and we can used it for annotation.

[PMR] 11:46:50 : The library for HTML, Library on natural language processing routines, Library on converting PDF which is a key thing since we get so much PDF. Small one on SVG..

[PMR] 11:47:08 : So we're possible. We convert the graphics to SVG, which is a semantically structured Tool. We got utilities, headless browser driver. Rounding boxes , File utilities at this browser game. Various Things for the command line, HTML logs and Yeah, fogs.

[PMR] 11:47:37 : And we were allowed one for dictionary. And various HTML tools. And then look up for Wikimedia and libraries for XML.

[PMR] 11:47:50 : Many of these are convenience libraries, which means that, we have a wrap around some of the more difficult parts of Python. So how do I join a list? With, commerce and then Formal way of doing that is very arcane for people just learning computer science, computer Systems and so on. So that's Amy Lib.

[PMR] 11:48:20 :
.
## RUNNING TESTS

[PMR] 11:48:26 :  And then with each Library, we have an extensive set of tests. So These are the tests. We've just started to include and so for example, Set of dictionary test

[PMR] 11:48:55 : It is a class with all the tests and and I think it's got nearly 60 tests.

[PMR] 11:49:03 : So here you see. Look up missing wiki data IDs by term. Debug chapter dictionaries.This, ambiguate wiki data IDs. Create dictionary from a list of strings you will all be doing that because you're creating a list of terms you're interested in.

[PMR] 11:49:40 : Some of them maybe skipped if there are too many of them but this actually runs quite quickly. 

[PMR] 11:50:37 : We've got 86 tests. It's finished in 21 seconds for me. 7 tests failed. And I can have a look and see why those tests failed. I've got a software error there. I've got to mend that.

[PMR] 11:51:53 : This is an error which you should recognize non-type object as no attributes get or create something or other. What it means is you created an object which you're going to do something with.

[PMR] 11:52:08 : And it turned out that that object didn't get created. And so you had a none object instead So. Okay, get used to that. And that's so we got 5 did not exist. I have to mend that.

[PMR] 11:52:25 : We've got one, Well, we've got none object. I've got to debug that. I will mend that and commit it

[PMR] 11:52:52 : I'm on PMR Dict's at the moment. So I've got several branches.

[PMR] 11:53:01 : PMR test is where I was, developing some of the Amy staff, the dict is something, related to dictionary so you can develop different things at the same time.

[PMR] 11:53:16 : And none of this will cause problems for Nitika who's got her own branch. Which is called, nitika test or something of that sort and which she can commit up to the, the main if necessary.

[PMR] 11:53:38 : At some stage we need to merge this.

[PMR] 11:53:53 : You will then find that, your, tests have errors, and we have to then mend them and commit a greater a larger and enhanced test first  
## AMICLIMATE

[PMR] 11:54:49
And here again, we work it by having tests. There's a whole lot of test data here.

[PMR] 11:54:56
So you can see I've got captors in here to read. And in particular one called, cleaned content which should approximate the final versions of the particular I think so, it's not comprehensive but I probably will make it comprehensive so that those people who got chapters will have a semantic version of their chapter because at the moment there's some problem about headless browsers with some of you.

[PMR] 11:55:41 : It is possible to put it somewhere in the system. What I'm likely to do, is to create a dictionary. A Directory somewhere in the system. And we might ask everybody to have a directory under their home directory called dictionary where the dictionaries are put.

[PMR] 11:56:07
Or we'll probably call it IPCC or Something of that sort. 

[PMR] 11:56:34 : So, Amy Climate, will look at the, Tests. So. Let's look at test IPCC.

[PMR] 11:56:47 : Here is our structure. And here we've got about 30 tests. And you can see things like remove gatsby mark up.

[PMR] 11:57:00 : Remove wordpress mark up At 6 WG 3 and index chapters with IDs.

[PMR] 11:57:12 : Let's see what it does. WG chapter, search for words and return a list of paragraphs in which they're So here, we're looking for these phrases. We're reading in WG 3 chapter 3.

[PMR] 11:57:34 : With the HTML with IDs, which is our, more or less final version.

[PMR] 11:57:39 : And then we will end up with some paragraphs here. Now, what we probably want to do is to save those to file

[PMR] 11:57:58 : This one I think actually creates Files. Not well documented. I certainly don't want to go through to at the moment, but we'll do that in our next debug system.

[PMR] 11:58:10 : So you can see how the tests develop here relate to the operations we want to carry out. So well done, Renu for bringing that up. So we have 2 main libraries for Amy the general Amy Lib, which you generally won't do very much with, and the Amy climate library, where you can develop it.

## REPOSITORY FOR `PYGETPAPERS`

[PMR] 11:58:35 : Researching the climate literature. I should also mention that we have `pygetpapers` here. So Ayush has recently updated `pygetpapers`. And, so there's a repository here about, `pygetpapers` and Somewhere or other we should have one for `docanalysis`

## `DOCANALYSIS`

[PMR] 11:59:42 : So this is `docanalysis`. `Docanalysis` doesn't have any, tests on it and that's something which may be some of you can help by writings and tests for `Docanalysis`.

[PMR] 12:00:06 : So having tests is valuable because it's a way of making sure that it continues to work even if you do things like upgrade, Python and so forth. So does that.

[PMR] 12:00:28 : We've also got dictionaries in the system. I will mention Try and find them. See if they're not.

[PMR] 12:00:47 : So I just mentioned this. We got dictionaries here under CEV open we've got things like compounds and genus and plant parts and things like that.

[PMR] 12:00:59 : And there are other ones which we've created. Which will do things like poverty and goodness knows what we've got a lot of Dictionary is pretty variable in form and so on.

[PMR] 12:01:17 : And what we need to do is to come up with a good way of creating those dictionaries, rapidly, automating as much of the process as possible and then using them to search and classify the material.

[PMR] 12:01:34 : We've got and to understand it when we've read it.

[PMR] 12:01:38 : So, Renu, thank you for that. Have we covered nearly everything?

[Renu Kumari] 12:01:43 : Yes, we do.
