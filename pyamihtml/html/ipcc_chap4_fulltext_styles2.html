<div id="id786"><span id="id787" class="s101">An  emissions  gap  persists,  exacerbated  by  an  implementation  gap,  despite  mitigation  efforts including  those  in  near-universal  nationally  determined  contributions  (NDCs)</span><span id="id789" class="s1">.  The  &#8220;emissions gap&#8221;  is  understood  as  the  difference  between  the  emissions  with  NDCs  in  2030,  and  mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goals. In general, the term &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; refers to the difference between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In this report, the term refers to the gap between mitigation pledges contained in national determined contributions, and the expected outcome  of  existing  policies.  There  is  considerable  literature  on  country-level  mitigation  pathways, including  but  not  limited  to  NDCs.  Country  distribution  of  this  literature  is  very  unequal  (</span><span id="id796" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id798" class="s1">). Current policies lead to median global GHG emissions of 57 GtCO</span><span id="id799" class="s10">2</span><span id="id800" class="s1">-eq with a full range of 52-60 by 2030.

A focus on energy use and supply is essential, but not sufficient on its own &#8211; the land sector and food systems deserve attention.

Various actors have developed an increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050 (mid-term). A growing number of such strategies aim at net zero GHG or CO</span><span id="id1020" class="s10">2</span><span id="id1021" class="s1">  emissions,  but  it  is  not  yet  possible  to  draw  global  implications  due  to  the  limited  size  of  sample (</span><span id="id1024" class="s103">medium evidence; low agreement</span><span id="id1025" class="s1">). Non-state actors are also engaging in a wide range of mitigation initiatives.  When  adding  up  emission  reduction  potentials,  sub-national  and  non-state  international cooperative  initiatives  could  reduce  up  to  about  20  GtCO</span><span id="id1028" class="s10">2</span><span id="id1029" class="s1">-eq  in  2030  (</span><span id="id1030" class="s103">limited  evidence,  medium agreement</span><span id="id1032" class="s1">).  Yet  perceived  or  real  conflicts  between  mitigation  and  other  Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) can impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found to have significant implications for development objectives and macroeconomic costs at country level. For example, most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation (</span><span id="id1038" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id1039" class="s1">). The literature finds that employment effect of mitigation policies tends to be limited on aggregate, but can be  significant  at sectoral level  (</span><span id="id1042" class="s103">limited  evidence,  medium  agreement</span><span id="id1043" class="s1">).  Detailed  design of mitigation policies is critical for distributional impacts and avoiding lock-in (</span><span id="id1045" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id1046" class="s1">), though further research is needed in that direction. {4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.6}  </span></div>
<div id="id1049"><span id="id1050" class="s101">Shifting  development  pathways  towards  sustainability  offers  ways  to  (i)  broaden  the  range  of levers  and  enablers  that  a  society  can  use  to  provide  enabling  conditions  and  accelerate mitigation; and (ii) increase the chances of advancing at the same time towards mitigation and towards other development goals</span><span id="id1054" class="s1">. The way countries develop determines their capacity to accelerate mitigation  and  achieve  other  sustainable  development  objectives  simultaneously  (</span><span id="id1056" class="s103">medium-robust evidence,  medium  agreement</span><span id="id1058" class="s1">).  Yet  meeting  ambitious  mitigation  and  development  goals  cannot  be achieved  through  incremental  change,  hence  the  focus  on  shifting  development  pathways  (</span><span id="id1060" class="s103">robust evidence, medium agreement</span><span id="id1062" class="s1">). Though development pathways result from the actions of a wide range of  actors,  it  is  possible  to  shift  development  pathways  through  policies  and  enhancing  enabling </span><span id="id1065" class="s1">conditions (</span><span id="id1066" class="s103">limited evidence, medium agreement</span><span id="id1067" class="s1">). For example, policies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally conceived  and  implemented  in  the  pursuit  of  overall  societal  development  objectives,  such  as  job creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. In some countries, such  policies  are  framed  as  part  of  a  just  transition.  However,  they  can  have  major  influence  on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options, as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway &#8220;Shifting Pathways&#8221; (</span><span id="id1074" class="s103">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span id="id1075" class="s1">).

Examples in other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole economies  and  societies.  Coordinated  policy  mixes  would  need  to  coordinate  multiple  actors&#8212;individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors&#8212;to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support mitigation and adaptation. Some studies explore the risks of high complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways. {4.3,  4.3.1,  4.3.2,  4.4.2,  4.4.3,  4.4.1.7-4.4.1.10,  Figure  4.7,  Cross-Chapter  Box  5,  5.8,  Box  6.2,  8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5, Cross-Chapter Box 7, Cross-Chapter Box 12}  </span></div>

Governance  for  climate  mitigation  and  shifting  development pathways  is  enhanced  when  tailored  to  national  and  local  contexts.  Improved  institutions  and governance enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation gaps (</span><span id="id1228" class="s103">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id1230" class="s1">). Given that strengthening institutions may be a long term endeavour, it needs attention in  the  near-term.  Accelerated  mitigation  and  shifting  development  pathways  necessitates  both  re-directing existing financial flows from high- to low-emissions technologies and systems and to provide additional  resources  to  overcome  current  financial  barriers.  (</span><span id="id1234" class="s103">robust  evidence,  high  agreement</span><span id="id1235" class="s1">). Opportunities exist in the near-term to close the finance gap.

In addition to this persistent emissions gap, we face an implementation gap, as current policies are insufficient to achieve mitigation targets in NDCs, and sufficient international support is not yet available to developing countries who have requested and quantified support needs. Continuing along a development pathway characterized by the same underlying drivers, structural obstacles and insufficient  enabling  conditions  that  led  to  high  emissions  will  not  address  the  problem  (</span><span id="id1550" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id1552" class="s1">). </span></div>
<div id="id1554"><span id="id1555" class="s1">The analysis of the gap is conducted together with Chapter 3 (see Cross-Chapter Box 4). Chapter 3 is working backward, assessing mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2050 up to 2100) to draw the near- and mid-term implications of long-term temperature and mitigations goals. Chapter 4, on the other hand, works forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) (4.2.1, 4.2.2) and from current development  paths  to  assess  the  implications  for  near-  and  mid-term  Greenhouse  Gases  (GHG) emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, cities, communities and non-state actors are taking leadership in implementing more ambitious action (4.2.3). This chapter also assesses national low emission development strategies (4.2.4). </span></div>
<div id="id1564"><span id="id1565" class="s101">Where do we want to go? </span><span id="id1566" class="s1">Technical alternatives and policy options exist to bridge the emissions and implementation  gaps,  and  the  literature  illustrates  these  with  a  wide  range  of  accelerated  techno-economic  pathways  that  deepen  decarbonisation  closer  to  the  pace  and  scale  required  (4.2.5),  and examines their impacts on other development objectives (4.2.6). In practice, however, scaling up at the broader, deeper, and faster level required to meet climate goals while advancing other development objectives  regularly  faces  prohibitive  obstacles  (4.2.7).  Mitigation  policies  grafted  on  to  existing development pathways are unlikely to achieve rapid and deep emission reductions.  </span></div>

<div id="id1717"><span id="id1718" class="s101">How can one shift development pathway and accelerate mitigation?</span><span id="id1719" class="s1"> The literature does not provide a  complete  handbook  for  shifting  development  pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation.  The  literature does, however, shed light on some of the underlying dynamics. Shifting development pathways can be necessitated by the existence of pervasive obstacles that prove prohibitive to reaching mitigation and other  development  objectives  (4.2.7).  Deliberate  measures  taken  to  facilitate  the  shifting  of development pathways and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling conditions that help  overcome  those  obstacles  (see  Figure  4.6)&#8212;improving  governance  and  institutional  capacity, fostering  behavioural  change  and  technological  innovation,  designing  and  implementing  adequate policy, and finance. Just transitions, while they will differ by context, are critical to identifying and avoiding or addressing inequitable distributive consequences (</span><span id="id1729" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id1730" class="s1">). </span></div>
<div id="id1732"><span id="id1733" class="s1">Enabling conditions necessary to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways are discussed in depth in Chapters 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16. In addition, Chapters 13 and 14 detail the policy instruments that  could  help  shift  development  pathways  and  accelerate  the  scale  and  pace  of  mitigation,  while Chapter 4 describes those in broad strategies terms. Chapter 13 adds more texture on institutional and governance  machinery;  policy  choice,  design  and  implementation;  as  well  as  policy  formulation processes, actors and structure across scales. </span></div>
<div id="id1740"><span id="id1741" class="s1">Since development pathways and mitigation options depend to large extent on national objectives and circumstances, this chapter is primarily concerned with literature at national level (or in the case of the European Union, at regional level), while Chapter 3 is primarily concerned with literature at global scale.  The  national  scale  selected in  this  Chapter  requires  attention  as  national mitigation  pathways cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (see Box 4.2). This chapter is also concerned mostly with economy-wide development and mitigation pathways, as distinct from detailed sectoral work that is assessed in the systems chapters 6 to 12. The present chapter also assesses literature on non-state action. </span></div>
<div id="id1750"><span id="id1751" class="s1">Chapter  4  draws  on  five  major  strands  of  literature:  (1)  an  emerging  literature  on  development pathways&#8212;conceptual, empirical, and model-based, including at the national and sub-national scales; (2)  a  rapidly  expanding,  model-based,  literature  on  mitigation  pathways  in  the  near-  and  mid-term (Lepault and Lecocq 2021); (3) studies of NDCs and mid-century strategies; (4) a broader literature on transformation and shifts in development pathways, including from non-climate literatures; and (5) a significant literature on equity, including just transitions. This is supported by a database of country-level mitigation scenarios at country level assembled for the preparation of this Chapter (Annex  III, Table I.10 and I.11). </span></div>

<div id="id1832"><span id="id1833" class="s1">Chapter 4 examines mitigation within the broader context of development pathways, and examines how shifting  development  pathways  can  have  a  major  impact  on  mitigative  capacity  and  broadening mitigation options. It is organized as follows. </span></div>
<div id="id1837"><span id="id1838" class="s1">Section 4.2 demonstrates that collective mitigation actions fall short of pathways that keep in reach the Paris  temperature  goals  in  the  long-term.  Section  4.3  introduces  development  pathways  (given  its relative novelty in IPCC assessments), considers the implications of mitigation for development and </span><span id="id1842" class="s103">vice  versa</span><span id="id1843" class="s1">,  and  articulates  an  approach  on  </span><span id="id1844" class="s103">both</span><span id="id1845" class="s1">  accelerating  mitigation  </span><span id="id1846" class="s103">and</span><span id="id1847" class="s1">  shifting  development pathways. </span></div>
<div id="id1850"><span id="id1851" class="s1">Section 4.4 discusses how to shift development pathway and accelerate the scale and pace of mitigation, what levers are available to policy makers, and how policies may intersect with adaptation goals. It points  out  that  development  pathways  also  drive  adaptation  and  adaptative  capacity,  and  discusses various risks associated with shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation strategies.  </span></div>
<div id="id1856"><span id="id1857" class="s1">Finally,  equity  and  just  transitions  are  recurring  themes  in  the  Chapter,  specifically  in  relation  to accelerating mitigation  and  shifting  development  pathways  toward  sustainability.  In  <a href="section.4.2.2.7">section  4.2.2.7</a>, equity is discussed in the context of Parties&#8217; assertions regarding the fairness of their NDCs, alongside reflections from academic scholarship on the ethical underpinnings of these assertions and of various quantitative  analyses  of  equitable  effort-sharing.  Section  4.2.6  discusses  certain  distributional implications of domestic mitigation efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections 4.2.7 and 4.3 note the  relevance  of  potential  distributional  impacts  as  an  obstacle  to  climate  action,  as  well  as  the inequitable  distribution  of  decision-making  authority.  Finally,  section  4.5  recognizes  the  structural relationship between equity and climate, explores just transitions as an international focal point tying together  social  movements,  trade  unions,  and  other  stakeholders,  and  thus  an  instrumental  role  in establishing consensus. </span></div>

Concrete actions and priority areas are more detailed in the energy sector, with increased share of renewable energies and energy efficiency being  highlighted  in  the  majority  of  NDCs.  Given  the  uncertainty  behind  LULUCF  emission  and removal accounting (Grassi et al. 2017; Jian et al. 2019), several countries state that their accounting framework will only be defined in later NDCs. The GHG included and the global warming potentials (GWPs)  used  to  aggregate  emissions  also  vary  across  NDCs.  Most  countries  only  refer  to  carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions aggregated based on IPCC AR2 or AR4 metrics, while few NDCs also include fluorinated gases and use IPCC AR5 GWPs. The shares of Parties that indicate possible use of at least one type of voluntary cooperation and set qualitative limits on their use  have both nearly doubled in new or updated NDCs. </span></div>

The  following  sections  present  an  evaluation  of  the  methods  used  for assessing  projected  emissions  under  NDCs  and  current  policies  (4.2.2.2),  and  the  results  of  these assessments at global, regional and national level assessing a broad available literature based on first NDC submissions from 2015/16 and pre-COVID economic projections (4.2.2.3). The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses on emissions projections are then discussed in 4.2.2.4 and the implications of updated NDCs submitted in 2020/21 on emissions follow in  4.2.2.5. Section  0  presents  an  assessment  of  the  so-called  &#8220;implementation  gap&#8221;  between  what  currently implemented  policies  are  expected  to  deliver  and  what  the  ambitions  laid  out  under  the  full implementation  of  the  NDCs  are  projected  to  achieve.  Finally,  a  comparison  of  ambitions  across different  countries  or  regions  (4.2.2.7)  is  presented  and  the  uncertainties  of  projected  emissions associated with NDCs and current policies are estimated, including a discussion of measures to reduce uncertainties in the specification of NDCs (4.2.2.8). </span></div>

Chapter 3 of this report works backwards from temperature goals, defining a range of long-term global pathways consistent with 1.5&#176;C, 2&#176;C and higher temperature levels. By considering the two together, it is possible to assess whether NDCs are collectively consistent with 1.5&#176;C, 2&#176;C and other temperature pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 4, p.4-22). </span></div>

<div id="id2484"><span id="id2485" class="s1">variety of modelling paradigms are found, including optimisation and simulation models, myopic and with foresight, monolithic and modular (see Annex III: Scenarios and modelling methods). </span></div>
<div id="id2488"><span id="id2489" class="s1">Among the hybrid approaches, three broader categories can be distinguished, (i) direct use of official emission projection as part of submitted NDC or other communication to UNFCCC, (ii) historical trend extrapolation  of  emissions  based  on  inventory  data,  possibly  disaggregated  by  sector  and  emission species, and (iii) use of Reference/Business-As-Usual pathways from an independent published study (e.g.,  IEA  WEO).  In  all  cases,  the  reductions  are  then  estimated  on  top  of  the  resulting  emission trajectory.  Note  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  may  vary  the  approach  used  depending  on  the country. </span></div>
<div id="id2497"><span id="id2498" class="s1">Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a number of dimensions, including (i) their spatial resolution and coverage, (ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are included in the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate them, the emissions inventory (official vs. independent  inventory  data)  and  related  accounting  approaches  used  as  a  starting  point  for  the projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, etc.),  and  (v)  the  degree  to  which  individual  policies  and  their  impact  on  emissions  are  explicitly represented (Table 4.1). </span></div>
<div id="id2506"><span id="id2507" class="s1">First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging from macro-scale regions with globally comprehensive coverage to national level (4.2.2.3) and subnational and company level in a few cases (4.2.3).  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  typically  resolve  a  limited number of countries individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, but  have  poor  resolution  of  remaining  countries  or  regions,  which  are  assessed  in  aggregate  terms. Conversely, studies with high resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the global scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts to provide a composite global picture from  detailed  national  studies  (Bataille  et  al.  2016a;  Deep  Decarbonization  Pathways  Project  2015; Roelfsema et al. 2020). </span></div>
<div id="id2517"><span id="id2518" class="s1">A second dimension in which the studies are different is their comprehensiveness of covering different emitting sectors. Some studies focus on the contribution of a single sector, for example the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector (Fyson and Jeffery 2019; Grassi et al. 2017) or the energy system (including both energy supply and demand sectors), to emission reductions as specified in the NDC. Such studies give an indication of the importance of a given sector to achieving the NDC target of a country and can be used as a benchmark to compare to comprehensive studies, but adding sectoral contributions up represents a methodological challenge. </span></div>
<div id="id2567"><span id="id2568" class="s1">Fifth, studies differ in the way they represent policies (current or envisioned in NDCs), depending on their  internal  structure.  For  example,  a  subsidy  to  energy  efficiency  in  buildings  may  be  explicitly </span></div>

Detailed representations (such as the former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate results than compact ones (the latter example), but the set of assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be very different. </span></div>
<div id="id2703"><span id="id2704" class="s1">Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just implementing high level targets specified in policy documents and NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact on emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and policies at subnational level. In addition, in countries  with  rapidly  evolving  policy  environments,  slightly  different  cut-off  dates for the  policies considered in an emission projection can make a significant difference for the results  (Dubash et al. 2018). </span></div>
<div id="id2711"><span id="id2712" class="s1">The challenges described above are dealt with in the assessment of quantitative results in Section 4.2.2.3 by (i) comparing national studies with country-level results from global studies to understand systematic biases, (ii) comparing economy-wide emissions (incl. AFOLU) as well as energy-related emissions, (iii) using different emission metrics including CO</span><span id="id2716" class="s10">2</span><span id="id2717" class="s1"> and Kyoto GHG emissions where the latter have been  harmonized  to  using  AR6  GWP100  metrics,  and  (iv)  tracking  cut-off  dates  of  implemented policies  and  NDCs  used  in  different  references  (Table  S4.1).  The  most  notable  differences  in quantitative emission estimates related to current policies and NDCs relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications and to the updated NDCs mostly submitted since early 2020 which are separately dealt with in Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.5, respectively. </span></div>
<div id="id2724"><span id="id2725" class="s1">In addition to assessing the emissions outcomes of NDCs, some studies report development indicators, by which they mean a wide diversity of socio-economic indicators (Altieri et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2013; Benavides et al. 2015; Chai and Xu 2014; Delgado et al. 2014; La Rovere et al. 2014a; Paladugula et al. 2018; Parikh et al. 2018; Zevallos et al. 2014; Zou et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2021; Bataille et al. 2016a), share  of  low-carbon  energy  (Bertram  et  al.  2015;  Riahi  et  al.  2015),  renewable  energy  deployment (Roelfsema et al. 2018), production of fossil fuels  (SEI et al. 2020) or investments into low-carbon mitigation measures (McCollum et al. 2018) to track progress towards long-term temperature goals. </span></div>

Transport is covered explicitly in 75% of NDCs, although specific targets for the sector exist in only 21% of NDCs (PPMC and SLoCaT 2016). Measures or targets for buildings are referred to explicitly in 27% of NDCs (GIZ 2017). 36% of NDCs  include  targets  or  actions  that  are  specific  to  the  agriculture  sector  (FAO  2016).  LULUCF (mitigation) is included in 80 % of all submitted NDCs, while 59 % include adaptation and 29 % refer to REDD+. </span></div>

However, it is worthwhile to note that the earlier versions of the studies summarized in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3 are broadly  representative  for  the  emissions  range  implied  by  the  pre-COVID-19  current  policies  and original NDCs of the full set of studies shown in Table 4.1, therefore building confidence in estimates. </span></div>
<div id="id6655"><span id="id6656" class="s1">An additional challenge lies in the fact that these studies do not all apply the same cut-off date for NDC updates, potentially leading to larger systematic deviations in the resulting emission estimates. Another complication is the fact that publicly announced mitigation pledges on global 2030 emissions that have not been officially submitted to the UNFCCC NDC registry yet, have been included in several of the studies to anticipate their impact on emission levels (see notes to Table 4.3). In addition to the updates of NDC targets, most of the new studies also include impacts of COVID-19 on future emission levels (as discussed in 4.2.2.4) which may have led to considerable downward revisions of emission trends unrelated to NDCs. Table 4.3 presents the emission estimates of the four studies that form the basis of the quantitative assessment presented here and three other studies to compare with. </span></div>

<div id="id7307"><span id="id7308" class="s1">Meanwhile, there is some literature at global and national level that aims at assessing whether countries are  on  track  or  progressing  towards  implementing  their  NDCs  and  to  which  degree  the  NDCs collectively are sufficient to reach the temperature targets of the Paris agreement (Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018; H&#246;hne et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2016; den Elzen et al. 2019; H&#246;hne et al. 2020). Most of these studies focus on major emitters such as G20 countries and with the aim to inform countries to strengthen their ambition regularly, e.g., through progress of NDCs and as part of the global stocktake (H&#246;hne et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2017). However, a limited number of studies assess the implementation gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity building support.

<div id="id7626"><span id="id7627" class="s1">The Paris Agreement (PA) sets a long-term goal of holding the increase of global average temperature to &#8216;well below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels&#8217; and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. This is underpinned by the &#8216;aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible&#8217; and &#8216;achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHG in the second half of this century&#8217; (UNFCCC 2015d). The PA adopts a bottom-up approach in which countries determine their contribution to reach the PA&#8217;s long-term goal. These national targets, plans and measures are called &#8216;nationally determined contributions&#8217; or NDCs. </span></div>
<div id="id7635"><span id="id7636" class="s1">The NDCs are a central instrument of the PA to achieve its long-term goal.

All signatory countries committed to communicating nationally determined contributions including mitigation targets, every five years. While the NDCs mostly state targets, countries are also obliged to pursue domestic mitigation measures to achieve the objectives. The  literature  examines the  emissions  outcome  of  the  range  of policies implemented to reach  these targets.  </span></div>

<div id="id7956"><span id="id7957" class="s1">A 2030 gap in the contribution of low-carbon energy sources to the energy mix in 2030 between current policies and cost-effective long-term temperature pathways is calculated to be around 7%-points (2&#176;C) and  13%-points (1.5&#176;C)  by  Roelfsema  et  al.  (Roelfsema  et  al. 2020).  The same  authors estimate an energy intensity improvement gap 10% and 18% for 2030 between current policies pathways and 2&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C pathways, respectively. SEI et al. (2020) estimates the &#8216;fossil fuel production gap&#8217;, i.e. the level of countries&#8217; planned fossil fuel production expressed in their carbon content to be 120% and 50% higher compared to the fossil fuel production consistent with 1.5</span><span id="id7964" class="s755">&#176;</span><span id="id7965" class="s1">C and 2</span><span id="id7966" class="s755">&#176;</span><span id="id7967" class="s1">C pathways, respectively, as assessed in IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). The methodology used for this estimation is very similar to how emissions gaps are derived (SEI et al. 2019). The gap of global annual average investments in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency in 2030 between following current policy on the one hand and achieving the NDCs, the 2&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C targets on the other hand, is estimated to be approximately USD 130, 320, or 480 billion per year (McCollum et al. 2018).  </span></div>
<div id="id7974"><span id="id7975" class="s1">It is important to note that such comparisons are less straight forward as the link between long-term temperature goals and these indicators is less pronounced compared to the emission levels themselves; they are therefore associated with greater uncertainty compared to the emissions gap.  </span></div>

<div id="id8221"><span id="id8222" class="s1">The decision adopting the Paris Agreement stresses the importance of  &#8220;stronger and more ambitious climate action&#8221; by non-government and subnational stakeholders, &#8220;including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples&#8221;  (UNFCCC  2015e).  The  Marrakech  Partnership  for  Global  Action,  launched  in  the  2016 UNFCCC Conference of Parties by two &#8220;high-level champions,&#8221; further formalized the contributions of  non-government  and subnational  actors taking  action  through  seven thematic  areas  (e.g.,  energy, human settlements, industry, land-use, etc.) and one cross-cutting area (resilience). Since then,  non-state  actors,  e.g.,  companies  and  civil  society,  and  subnational  actors,  e.g.  cities  and  regions,  have emerged to undertake a range of largely voluntary carbon mitigation actions (Hsu et al. 2019, 2018) both  as  individual  non-state  actors  (NSA  in  the  following)  and  through  national  and  international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) (Hsu et al. 2018). ICIs take a variety of forms, ranging from those that focus solely on non-state actors to those that engage national and even local governments. They can also  range  in  commitment  level,  from  primarily  membership-based  initiatives  that  do  not  require specific actions to those that require members to tackle emissions reductions in specific sectors or aim for transformational change. </span></div>
<div id="id8238"><span id="id8239" class="s1">Quantification of the (potential) impact of these actions is still limited. Almost all studies estimate the potential impact of the implementation of actions by NSA and ICI, but do not factor in that they may not reach their targets. The main reason for this is that there is very limited data currently available from individual actors (e.g., annual GHG inventory reports) and initiatives to assess their progress towards their  targets.  A  few  studies  have  attempted  to  assess  progress  of  initiatives  by  looking  into  the initiatives&#8217;  production  of  relevant  outputs  (Chan  et  al.  2018).  Quantification  does  not  yet  cover  all commitments and only a selected number of ICIs are analysed in the existing literature. Most of these studies exclude commitments that are not (self-)identified as related to climate change mitigation, those that are not connected to international networks, or those that are communicating in languages other than English. </span></div>
<div id="id8250"><span id="id8251" class="s1">Non  state  action  could  make  significant  contributions  to  achieving  the  Paris  climate  goals  (</span><span id="id8252" class="s103">limited evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id8254" class="s1">). However, efforts to measure the extent to which non-state and subnational actors go beyond national policy are still nascent (Kuramochi et al. 2020; Hsu et al. 2019) and we do not  fully  understand  the  extent  to  which  ambitious  action  by  non-state  actors  is  additional  to  what national governments intend to do. Subnational and non-state climate action may also have benefits in reinforcing, implementing, or piloting national policy, in place of or in addition to achieving additional emissions reductions (Broekhoff et al. 2015; Heidrich et al. 2016; Hsu et al. 2017). </span></div>

That said, the estimates are contingent on assumptions that subnational and non-state actors achieve commitments&#8212;both with respect to mitigation and in some cases membership&#8212;and that these actions are not accounted for in nor lead to weakening of national actions. </span></div>

As the diversity of actions increased, the potential to count the same reductions multiple times increases. </span></div>

<div id="id10152"><span id="id10153" class="s1">reduced. As Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1 indicate, activities by businesses have potential to significantly contribute  to  global  mitigation  efforts.  For  example,  the  SBTi  (Science-Based  Targets  Initiative) encourages companies to pledge to reduce their emissions at rates which according to SBTI would be compatible  with  global  pathways  to  well  below  2&#176;C  or  1.5&#176;C,  with  various  methodologies  being proposed (Andersen et al. 2021; Faria and Labutong 2019). Readers may note, however, that the link between emissions by individual actors and long-term temperature goals cannot be inferred without additional assumptions (see Box 4.2). In the energy sector, some voluntary initiatives are also emerging to  stop  methane  emissions  associated  with  oil  and  gas  supply  chains.  The  Oil  and  Gas  Methane Partnership (OGMP) is a voluntary initiative lead by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which has recently  published  a  comprehensive  framework  for  methane  detection,  measurement  and  reporting (UNEP 2020b). </span></div>
<div id="id10165"><span id="id10166" class="s1">Initiatives  made  up  of  cities  and  subnational  regions  have  an  especially  large  potential  to  reduce emissions, due to their inclusion of many actors, across a range of different geographic regions, with ambitious  emissions  reduction  targets,  and  these  actors&#8217;  coverage  of  a  large  share  of  emissions (Kuramochi et al. 2020). Hsu et al. (2019) find largest potential in that area. Several subnational regions like California and Scotland have set zero emission targets (H&#246;hne et al. 2019), supported by short- and medium-term interim goals  (Scottish Government 2020; State of California 2018). Sharing of effort across global and sub-global scales has not been quantified, though one study suggests that non-state actors  have  increasingly  adopted  more  diverse  framings,  including  vulnerability,  human  rights  and transformational framings of  justice  (Shawoo  and McDermott  2020).  Initiatives  focused  on forestry have  high  emissions  reduction  potential  due  to  the  current  high  deforestation  rates,  and  due  to  the ambitious targets of many of these forestry initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Forests&#8217; goal  to  end  deforestation  by  2030  (H&#246;hne  et  al.  2019;  Lui  et  al.  2021),  although  the  Initiative acknowledges that insufficient progress has to-date been made towards this goal (NYDF Assessment Partners  2020).  On  the  other  hand,  uncertainties  in  global  forest  carbon  emissions  (and  therefore potential reductions)  are  high  and  despite  a multitude  of  initiatives  in the  sector,  actually  measured deforestation rates have not declined since the initiative was announced in 2014 (7.2, 7.3.1). Moreover, not all initiatives are transparent about how they plan to reach their goals and may also rely on offsets. </span></div>

The Global Cement and Concrete Association (formerly the Cement Sustainability Initiative), has contributed to the development of consistent energy and  emissions  reporting  from  member  companies.  The  CSI  also  suggested  possible  approaches  to balance GHG mitigation and the issues of competitiveness and leakage (Cook and Ponssard 2011). The member companies of the GCCA (CSI) have become better prepared for future legislation on managing </span><span id="id10198" class="s1">GHG  emissions  and  developed management competence to respond  to  climate change  compared  to non-member  companies  in  the  cement  sector  (Busch  et  al.  2008;  Global  Cement  and  Concrete Association 2020). Accordingly, the cement industry has developed some roadmaps to reach net zero GHG around 2050 (Sanju&#225;n et al. 2020). </span></div>

Table 4.6 lists the countries that have a national net zero by 2050 target in laws, strategies or other documents (The Energy and  Climate  Intelligence  Unit  2019).  Bhutan  and  Suriname  already  have  achieved  net  negative emissions.  France  second &#8220;low-carbon  national strategy&#8221;  adopted in 2020 has  an  objective  of  GHG neutrality by 2050. Net zero is also the basis of the recent revision of the official notional price of carbon for public investment in France  (Quinet et al. 2019).

For  Germany,  three  steps  to  climate neutrality by 2050 are introduced: First, a 65% reduction of emissions by 2030; second, a complete switch to climate- neutral technologies, leading to a 95% cut in emissions, all relative to 1990 levels by 2050; and third balancing of residual emissions through carbon capture and storage (G&#246;rz et al. 2020).

<div id="id11507"><span id="id11508" class="s1">Since the 2000s, an increasing number of studies have quantified the emission pathways to mid-century by using national scale models. In the early stages, the national emission pathways were mainly assessed in the developed countries such as Germany, UK, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada, and USA. For  example,  the  Enquete Commission in  Germany  identified  robust  and  sustainable  80%  emission reduction pathways (Deutscher Bundestag 2002). In Japan, 2050 Japan Low-Carbon Society scenario team (2008) assessed the 70% reduction scenarios in Japan, and summarized the necessary measures to &#8220;Dozen Actions towards Low-Carbon Societies.&#8221;  </span></div>
<div id="id11516"><span id="id11517" class="s1">Among developing countries, China, India, South Africa assessed their national emission pathways. For example, detailed analysis was undertaken to analyse pathways to China&#8217;s goal for carbon neutrality (EFC 2020). In South Africa, a Scenario Building Team (2007) quantified the Long Term Mitigation Scenarios for South Africa.  </span></div>

To  do  so,  drastic  mitigation  is  introduced  immediately,  and,  as  a  result,  the mitigation target of Japan&#8217;s current NDC is considered not sufficient to achieve a 1.5&#176;C scenario. Jiang et al. (2018) also show the possibility of net negative emissions in the power sector in China by 2050, indicating that biomass energy with CCS must be adopted on a large scale by 2040.

In  China,  India,  Japan  and  other  Southeast  Asian countries, more aggressive action related to climate change is also motivated by regional concerns over health and air quality related to air pollutants and SLCFs (Ashina et al. 2012; Aggarwal 2017; Dhar et al. 2018; Xunzhang et al. 2017; Khanna et al. 2019; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019; Oshiro et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018; Kuramochi et al. 2017). Studies of accelerated mitigation pathways in North America tend to focus on power sector and imported fuel decarbonisation in the US , and on electrification and demand-side reductions in Canada (Hammond et al. 2020; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Jayadev et al. 2020; Hodson et  al.  2018;  Victor  et  al.  2018;  Bahn  and  Vaillancourt  2020).  In  Latin  America,  many  pathways emphasise  supply-side  mitigation  measures,  finding  that  replacing  thermal  power  generation  and developing  bioenergy  (where  resources  are  available)  utilisation  offers  the  greatest  mitigation opportunities (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Lap et al. 2020; Herreras Mart&#237;nez et al. 2015; Arango-Aramburo et al. 2019; Delgado et al. 2020). The European Union-28&#8217;s recently announced 2050 climate neutrality  goal  is  explored  by  pathways  that  emphasise  complete  substitution  of  fossil  fuels  with electricity  generated  by  low-carbon  sources,  particularly  renewables;  demand  reductions  through efficiency and conservation, and novel fuels and end-use technologies (Capros et al. 2019; Zappa et al. 2019; Louis et al. 2020; Duscha et al. 2019; Prognos &#214;ko-Institut Wuppertal-Institut 2020). The limited literature so far on Africa&#8217;s future pathways suggest those could be shaped by increasing energy access and  mitigating  the  air  pollution  and  health  effects  of  relying  on  traditional  biomass  use,  as  well  as cleaner expansion of power supply alongside end-use efficiency improvements (Hamilton and Kelly 2017; Oyewo et al. 2020, 2019; Wright et al. 2019; Ven et al. 2019; Forouli et al. 2020). </span></div>

Models  continuously  underestimate  the  speed  at  which  renewables  and  storage expand. Higher penetration of renewable energy in the power sector is a common theme in scenarios. Some studies provide cost optimal electricity mix under emission constraints, while others explicitly explore a 100% renewables or 100% emission free electricity sector (Box 4.3). </span></div>

<div id="id12656"><span id="id12657" class="s1">In South Africa, it is found that long-term mitigation goals could be achieved with accelerated adoption of solar PV and wind generation, if the electricity sector decarbonises by phasing-out coal entirely by 2050, even if CCS is not feasible before 2025 (Altieri et al. 2015; Beck et al. 2013). Abundant solar PV and  wind  potential, coupled  with  land  availability  suggest  that  more than  75% of  power  generation could ultimately originate from solar PV and wind (Oyewo et al. 2019; Wright et al. 2019). </span></div>

<div id="id12668"><span id="id12669" class="s1">Under cost optimisation scenarios for Brazil, electricity generation, which is  currently dominated by hydropower,  could  reach  100%  by  adding  biomass  (K&#246;berle  et  al.  2020).

Increased imports may be needed to meet significant increases in EU&#8217;s bioenergy use, which could affect energy security and the sustainability of bioenergy production outside of the EU (Mandley et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2020).  </span></div>

The effectiveness of BECCS could depend on local contexts, choice of biomass, fate of initial aboveground biomass and fossil-fuel emissions offsets&#8212;carbon removed through BECCS could be offset by losses due to land-use change (Harper et al. 2018; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021). Large-scale BECCS may push planetary boundaries for freshwater use, exacerbate land-system change, significantly alter biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows (Heck et al. 2018; Stenzel et al. 2021; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Ai et al. 2021).

Some limitations of CCS, including uncertain costs, lifecycle and net emissions, other biophysical resource needs, and social acceptance  are  acknowledged  in  existing  studies  (Sekera  and  Lichtenberger  2020;  Jacobson 2019;Viebahn et al. 2014; Mathur and Shekhar 2020)  </span></div>
<div id="id13119"><span id="id13120" class="s1">While national mitigation portfolios aiming at net zero emissions or lower will need to include some level of CDR, the choice of methods and the scale and timing of their deployment will depend on the ambition for gross emission reductions, how sustainability and feasibility constraints are managed, and how  political  preferences  and  social  acceptability  evolve  (Cross-Chapter  Box  8).  Furthermore, mitigation deterrence may create further uncertainty, as anticipated future CDR could dilute incentives to reduce emissions now (Grant et al. 2021), and the political economy of net negative emissions has implications for equity (Mohan et al. 2021). </span></div>

Unlike other energy sources such as wind and PV solar, levelized costs of nuclear power has been rising in the last decades (Portugal-Pereira et al. 2018; Gilbert et al. 2017; Grubler 2010). This is mainly due to overrun of overnight construction costs related to delays in project approvals and construction, and more  stringent  passive  safety  measures,  which  increases  the  complexity  of  systems.  After  the Fukushima Dai-Ichi accident in Japan, nuclear programs in several countries have been phased out or cancelled (Carrara 2020; Huenteler et al. 2012; Kharecha and Sato 2019; Hoffman and Durlak 2018).

For China to meet a 1.5&#176;C pathway or achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, nuclear may represent 14%-28% of power generation in 2050 according to (Jiang et al. 2018; China National  Renewable  Energy  Centre  2019;  Energy  Transitions  Commission  and  Rocky  Mountain Institute 2019). For South Korea, (Hong et al. 2014; Hong and Brook 2018) find that increasing nuclear power can help complement renewables in decarbonizing the grid. Similarly, India has put in place a 3-stage nuclear programme which aims to enhance nuclear power capacity from the current level of  6 GW  to  63  GW  by  2032,  if  fuel  supply  is  ensured  (GoI  2015).

<div id="id13317"><span id="id13318" class="s1">Air conditioner adoption is rising significantly in low- and middle-income countries as incomes rise and average temperatures increase, including in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam,  and  the  Philippines,  as  well  as  Brazil,  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  and  Nigeria  (Biardeau  et  al. 2020). Cooling appliances are expected to increase from 3.6 billion to 9.5 billion by 2050, though up to 14 billion could be required to provide adequate cooling for all (Birmingham Energy Institute 2018). Current technology pathways are not sufficient to deliver universal access to cooling or meet the 2030 targets under the SDGs, but energy efficiency, including in equipment efficiency like air conditioners, can  reduce  this  demand  and  help  limit  additional  emissions  that  would  further  exacerbate  climate change (UNEP and IEA 2020; Dreyfus et al. 2020; Biardeau et al. 2020). Some countries (India, South Africa) have started to recognise the need for more efficient equipment in their mitigation strategies (Paladugula et al. 2018; Altieri et al. 2016; Ouedraogo 2017). </span></div>
<div id="id13330"><span id="id13331" class="s1">One possible synergy between SLCF and climate change mitigation is the simultaneous improvement in  energy  efficiency  in  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning  equipment  during  the  hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)  phase-down,  as  recognised  in  the  Kigali  Amendment  to  the  Montreal  Protocol.  The  Kigali Amendment  and  related  national  and  regional  regulations  are  projected  to  reduce  future  radiative forcing from HFCs by about half in 2050 compared to a scenario without any HFC controls, and to reduce future global average warming in 2100 from a baseline of 0.3-0.5&#176;C to less than 0.1&#176;C, according to  a  recent  scientific  assessment  of  a  wide  literature  (World  Meteorological  Organization  2018).  If ratified by signatories, the rapid phase-down of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment is possible because of extensive replacement of high-global warming potential (GWP) HFCs with commercially available low-GWP  alternatives  in  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning  equipment.

For the EU-28 to reach net carbon neutrality, complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity (up to 65% share), district heating, and direct use of solar and ambient heat are projected to be needed for buildings, along with increased use of solar thermal and heat pumps for heating  (Duscha et al. 2019). In the UK and Canada, improved insulation to reduce energy demand and efficient building appliances and heating systems are important building strategies needed to reduce emissions to zero by 2050 (Roberts et al. 2018a;  Vaillancourt  et  al.  2017;  Chilvers  et  al.  2017).  In  Ireland,  achieving  80%-95%  emissions reduction  below  1990  levels  by  2050  also  requires  changes  in  building  energy  technology  and efficiency,  including  improving  building  envelopes,  fuel  switching  for  residential  buildings,  and replacing service-sector coal use with gas and renewables according to (Chiodi et al. 2013). In South Africa, improving industry and building energy efficiency is also considered a key part of mitigation strategies (Ouedraogo 2017; Altieri et al. 2016). </span></div>
<div id="id13483"><span id="id13484" class="s1">In addition, an increasing number of countries have set up Net Zero Energy Building targets (Table 4.8) (H&#246;hne et al. 2020). Twenty seven countries have developed roadmap documents for NZEBs, mostly in developed countries in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, focusing on energy efficiency and improved insulation and design, renewable and smart technologies (Mata et al. 2020). The EU, Japan and the U.S. (the latter for public buildings only) have set targets for shifting new buildings to 100% near-zero energy buildings by 2030, with earlier targets for public buildings. Scotland has a similar target for 2050 (H&#246;hne et al. 2020). Technologies identified as needed for achieving near-zero energy buildings vary by region, but include energy-efficient envelope components, natural ventilation, passive cooling and heating, high performance building systems, air heat recovery, smart and information and communication technologies, and changing future heating and cooling supply fuel mixes towards solar, geothermal, and biomass (Mata et al. 2020). Subnational regions in Spain, U.S., Germany, and Mexico have set local commitments to achieving net zero carbon new buildings by 2050, with California having the most ambitious aspirational target of zero net energy buildings for all new buildings by 2030 (H&#246;hne et al. 2020). The EU is also targeting the retrofitting of 3% of existing public buildings to zero-energy, with emphasis on greater thermal insulation of building envelopes (Mata et al. 2020; H&#246;hne et al. 2020). China&#8217;s  roadmaps  have  emphasised  insulation  of  building  envelope,  heat  recovery  systems  in combination with renewable energy, including solar, shallow geothermal, and air source heat pumps (Mata et al. 2020). </span></div>

Ambitious reductions of methane are complementary to, rather than substitutes for, reductions in CO</span><span id="id14159" class="s10">2</span><span id="id14160" class="s1"> (Nisbet et al. 2020). </span></div>
<div id="id14162"><span id="id14163" class="s1">Rapid SLCF reductions, specifically of methane, black carbon, and tropospheric ozone have immediate co-benefits including meeting sustainable development goals for reducing health burdens of household air pollution and reversing health- and crop-damaging tropospheric ozone (Jacobson 2002, 2010). SLCF mitigation measures can have regional impacts, including avoiding premature deaths in Asia and Africa and  warming  in  central  and  Northern  Asia,  southern  Africa,  and  the  Mediterranean  (Shindell  et  al. 2012). Reducing outdoor air pollution could avoid 2.4 million premature deaths and 52 million tonnes of crop losses for four major staples  (Haines et al. 2017). Existing research emphasises climate and agriculture  benefits  of  methane  mitigation  measures  with  relatively  small  human  health  benefits (Shindell et al. 2012). Research also predicts that black carbon mitigation could substantially benefit global climate and human health, but there is more uncertainty about these outcomes than about some other predictions (Shindell et al. 2012). Other benefits to SLCF reduction include reducing warming in the critical near-term, which will slow amplifying feedbacks, reduce the risk of non-linear changes, and reduce long-term cumulative climate impacts&#8212;like sea-level rise&#8212;and mitigation costs (Hu et al. 2017; UNEP and WMO 2011; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Xu and Ramanathan 2017; Shindell et al. 2012). </span></div>

<div id="id14661"><span id="id14662" class="s1">Two  major  mechanisms  interplay  to  explain  the  impact  of  mitigation  on  GDP.  First,  the  carbon constraint  imposes  reduced  use  of  a  production  factor  (fossil  energy),  thus  reducing  GDP.  In  the simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households reduce their use of GHG-intensive goods and services in response to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive investment elsewhere (Fujimori et al.  2019),  except  in  Keynesian  models  in  which  increased  public  investment  actually  boosts  GDP (Pollitt et al. 2015; Bulavskaya and Reyn&#232;s 2018; Landa Rivera et al. 2016). Magnitude and duration of GDP loss depend on the stringency of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-GHG-intensive  goods  and  services,  assumptions  about  costs  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  their evolution over time (e.g., (Duan et al. 2018; van Meijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) and decisions by trading partners, which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; Fragkos et al. 2017) (</span><span id="id14674" class="s103">high evidence</span><span id="id14675" class="s1">, </span><span id="id14676" class="s103">high agreement</span><span id="id14677" class="s1">). </span></div>
<div id="id14679"><span id="id14680" class="s1">In the near-term, presence of long-lived emissions intensive capital stock, and rigidities in the labour market (Devarajan et al. 2011) and other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP. In the mid-term,  on  the  other  hand,  physical  and  human  capital,  technology,  institutions,  skills  or  location  of households and  activities  are  more flexible.  The  development  of renewable  energy  may help  create more employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill labour market (Hartley et al. 2019). In addition, cumulative mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts of mitigation on GDP. </span></div>

Chateau et al. (2018) and OECD (2017a) find that the implementation of green policies globally (defined broadly as  policies  that  internalise  environmental  externalities  through  taxes  and  other  tools,  shifting </span><span id="id15092" class="s1">profitability from polluting to green sectors) need not harm total employment, and that the broad skill </span><span id="id15094" class="s1">composition (low-, high- and medium-skilled jobs) of emerging and contracting sectors is very similar, with the largest shares of job creation and destruction at the lowest skill level. To smoothen the labour market  transition,  they  conclude  that  it  may  be  important  to  reduce  labour  taxes,  to  compensate vulnerable households, and to provide education and training programs, the latter making it easier for labour to move to new jobs. Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact of scenarios with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) find  relatively  small  (positive  or  negative)  impacts  on  aggregate  global  employment  that  are  more positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial losses for sectors and regions that today are  heavily  dependent  on  fossil  fuels  (Arndt  et  al.  2013;  Huang  et  al.  2019;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016; Jacobson et al. 2019).  Among worker categories, low-skilled workers tend to suffer wage losses as they are  more  likely  to  have  to  reallocate,  something  that  can  come  at  a  cost  in  the  form  of  a  wage  cut (assuming that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who already work in the sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in labour  taxes  often  leads  to  the  most  positive  employment  outcomes  while  lump-sum  (uniform  per-capita) transfers to households irrespective of income yield a more egalitarian outcome. </span></div>

On  the  other  hand,  sectoral  reallocations  away  from  fossil-dependent sectors may be substantial, see e.g., (Alton et al. 2014) for South Africa or  (Huang et al. 2019) for China.

First,  the  price  increase  in  energy-intensive  goods  and  services&#8212;including  food  (Hasegawa  et  al. 2018)&#8212;associated with mitigation may affect poorer households disproportionally (Bento 2013), and increase the number of energy-poor (Berry 2019). Second, the mitigation may disproportionally affect low-skilled  workers  (see  previous  section).  Distributional  issues  have  been  identified  not  only  with explicit price measures (carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with subsidies for renewables (Borenstein and Davis 2016), and efficiency and emissions standards (Davis and Knittel 2019; Bruegge et al. 2019; Levinson 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019). </span></div>

(2019)). In an analysis of the distributional impact of carbon pricing based on household expenditure data for 87 low- and middle-income countries, Dorband et  al.    (2019)  find  that,  in  countries  with  a  per-capita  income  of  up  to  USD15,000  per  capita  (PPP adjusted), carbon  pricing  has  a  progressive impact  on  income  distribution and that there may  be  an inversely U-shaped relationship between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering carbon  pricing  regressive  in  high-income  countries,  i.e.,  in  countries  where  the  capacity  to  pursue compensatory policies tends to be relatively strong. </span></div>

In an analysis of Latin America and the Caribbean, they find that allocation of 30 percent of carbon revenues would suffice to compensate poor and vulnerable households on average, leaving the rest for other uses. This policy tool is not only available in countries with relatively high per-capita incomes: in Sub-Saharan Africa, where per-capita incomes are relatively low, cash transfer programs have been implemented in almost all countries ((Beegle et al. 2018), p. 57), and are found central  to  the  success  of  energy  subsidy  reforms  (Rentschler  and  Bazilian  2017).  In  the  same  vein, B&#246;hringer et al. (2021) finds that recycling of revenues  from emissions pricing in equal amounts to every  household  appeals  as  an  attractive  strategy  to  mitigate  regressive  effects  and  thereby  make stringent climate policy more acceptable on societal fairness grounds. However, distributional gains </span><span id="id15308" class="s1">from such recycling may come at the opportunity cost of not reaping efficiency gains from reductions in the taxes that are most distortionary (Goulder et al. 2019).  </span></div>

<div id="id15442"><span id="id15443" class="s1">Investments  in  public  transportation  may  reduce  horizontal  redistribution  if  it  makes  it  easier  for households to reduce fossil fuel consumption when prices increase (cf. Section 4.4.1.5 and 4.4.1.9). Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (Charlier et al. 2019). From a different angle, public acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have been enhanced via a public information campaign could have raised public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (Douenne and Fabre 2020). (See section 4.4.1.8 for a discussion of this and other factors that influence public support for carbon taxation.). </span></div>

<div id="id15458"><span id="id15459" class="s1428">in development pathways  </span></div>
<div id="id15461"><span id="id15462" class="s1">As outlined in Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 there is improved understanding since AR5 of what accelerated  mitigation  would  entail  in  the  coming  decades.  A  major  finding  is  that  accelerated mitigation  pathways  in  the  near-  to  mid-term  appear  technically  and  economically  feasible  in  most contexts. Chapter 4, however, cannot stop here. Section 4.2.2 has documented an important policy gap for  current  climate  pledges,  and  Cross-Chapter  Box  4  shows  an  even  larger  ambition  gap  between current pledges and what would be needed in the near- term to be on pathways consistent with below 2&#176;C, let alone 1.5&#176;C. In other words, while the implementation of mitigation policies to achieve updated NDC  almost  doubles  the  mitigation  efforts,  and  notwithstanding  the  widespread  availability  of  the necessary technologies, this doubling of effort merely narrows the gap to pathways consistent with 2&#176;C by at most 20%.  </span></div>
<div id="id15473"><span id="id15474" class="s1">Obstacles  to  the  implementation  of  accelerated  mitigation  pathways  can  be  grouped  in  four  main categories (Table 4.10). The first set of arguments can be understood through the lens of cost-benefit analysis of decision-makers, as they revolve around the following question: Are costs too high relative to benefits? More precisely, are the opportunity costs&#8212;in economics terms, what is being forfeited by allocating  scarce  resources  to  mitigation&#8212;justified  by  the  benefits  for  the  decision-maker  (whether individual,  firm,  or  nation)?  This  first  set  of  obstacles  is  particularly  relevant  because  accelerated mitigation pathways imply significant effort in the short-run, while benefits in terms of limited warming accrue later and almost wholly to other actors. However, as discussed in 3.6 and 4.2.6, mitigation costs for  a  given  mitigation  target  are  not  carved  in  stone.  They  strongly  depend  on  numerous  factors, including the way mitigation policies have been designed, selected, and implemented, the processes through which markets have been shaped by market actors and institutions, and nature of socially- and culturally-determined  influences  on  consumer  preferences.  Hence,  mitigation  choices  that  might  be </span><span id="id15487" class="s1">expressed straightforwardly as techno-economic decisions are, at a deeper level, strongly conditioned by underlying structures of society. </span></div>

<div id="id15657"><span id="id15658" class="s1">A second set of likely obstacles in the short-term to accelerated mitigation revolves around undesirable distributional  consequences,  within  and  across  countries.  As  discussed  in  4.2.6.3,  the  distributional implications of climate policies depend strongly on their design, the way they are implemented, and on the context into which they are inserted. Distributional implications of climate policies have both ethics and equity dimensions, to determine what is desirable/acceptable by a given society in a given context, notably the relative power of different winners and losers to have their interests taken into account, or not, in the relevant decision-making processes. Like costs, distributional implications of accelerated mitigation are rooted in the underlying socio-political-institutional structures of a society. </span></div>
<div id="id15667"><span id="id15668" class="s1">A third set of obstacles are about technology availability and adoption. Lack of access even to existing cost-effective  mitigation  technologies  remains  an  important  issue,  particularly  for  many  developing countries,  and  even  in  the  short-term.  Though  it  relates  most  directly  to  techno-economic  costs, technology  availability  raises  broader  issues  related  to  the  sociotechnical  systems  within  which innovation and adoption are embedded, and issues of technology availability are inherently issues of systemic failure (16.3). The underlying legal, economic and social structures of the economy are central to the different stages of socio-transition processes (Cross-Chapter Box 12). </span></div>
<div id="id15676"><span id="id15677" class="s1">The  last  set  of  obstacles  revolves  around  the  unsuitability  of  existing  structures  to  accelerated mitigation. We include here all forms of established structures, material (e.g., physical capital) or not (institutions, social norms, patterns of individual behaviour), that are potentially long-lived and limit the  implementation  of  accelerated  mitigation  pathways.  Typically,  such  structures  exist  for  reasons other than climate change and climate mitigation, including the distribution of power among various actors. Modifying them in the name of accelerated climate mitigation thus requires to deal with other non-climate issues as well. For example, resolving the landlord-tenant dilemma, an institutional barrier </span><span id="id15685" class="s1">to the deployment of energy efficiency in building, opens fundamental questions on private property in buildings. </span></div>

A society&#8217;s development pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety of perspectives, capturing a range of possible  features,  trends,  processes,  and  mechanisms.  It  can  be  examined  in  terms  of  specific quantitative  indicators,  such  as  population,  urbanisation  level,  life  expectancy,  literacy  rate,  GDP, carbon dioxide emission rate, average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described with reference  to  trends  and  shifts  in  broad  socio-political  or  cultural  features,  such  as  democratisation, liberalisation,  colonisation,  globalisation,  consumerism,  etc.  Or,  it  can  be  described  in  a  way  that highlights  and  details  a  particular  domain  of  interest;  for  example,  as  an  &#8220;economic  pathway&#8221;, &#8220;technological  pathway&#8221;,  &#8220;demographic  pathway&#8221;,  or  others.  Any  such  focused  description  of  a pathway is more limited, by definition, than the general and encompassing notion of a development pathway. </span></div>
<div id="id16033"><span id="id16034" class="s1">Development pathways represent societal evolution over time, and can be assessed retrospectively and interpreted in a historical light, or explored prospectively by anticipating and assessing alternative future pathways.  Development  pathways,  and  prospective  development  pathways  in  particular,  can  reflect societal  objectives,  as  in  &#8220;low-emission  development  pathways&#8221;,  &#8220;climate-resilient  development pathways&#8221;, &#8220;sustainable development pathways&#8221;, &#8220;inclusive development pathway&#8221;, and as such can embed normative assumptions or preferences, or can reflect potential dystopian futures to be avoided.

The results of scenario explorations, including modelling exercises, thus help clarify the characteristics of a particular future pathway, in light of a particular set of assumptions and choice of indicators for assessment. Processes of developing scenarios can inform choices by decision makers of various kinds.  </span></div>

Humankind currently faces  multiple  sustainability  challenges  that  together  present  global  society  with  the  challenge  of assessing, deliberating, and attempting to bring about a viable, positive future development pathway. Ecological sustainability challenges include reducing GHG emissions, protecting the ozone, controlling pollutants such as aerosols and persistent organics, managing nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, etc. (Steffen  et  al.  2015),  which  are  necessary  to  address  the  rising  risks  to  biodiversity  and  ecosystem services on which humanity depends (IPBES 2019a). Socioeconomic sustainability challenges include conflict, persistent poverty and deprivation, various forms of pervasive and systemic discrimination and deprivation, and socially corrosive inequality. The global adoption of the SDGs and their underlying indicators (United Nations 2018) reflect a negotiated prioritisation of these common challenges.  </span></div>

<div id="id16771"><span id="id16772" class="s1">Systematic studies of the 17 SDGs have found the interactions among them to be manifold and complex (Pradhan et al. 2017; Nilsson et al. 2016; Weitz et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). Addressing them calls  for  interventions  affecting  fundamental,  interconnected,  structural  features  of  global  society (International  Panel on  Social  Progress  2018;  TWI2050  -  The  World in  2050 2018),  such  as to  our physical  infrastructure  (e.g.,  energy,  water,  industrial,  urban  infrastructure)  (Thacker  et  al.  2019; Adshead et al. 2019; Waage et al. 2015; Mansell et al. 2019; Chester 2019), our societal institutions (e.g., educational, public health, economic, innovation, and political institutions)  (Sachs et al. 2019; Ostrom  2010;  Kl&#228;y  et  al.  2015;  Messner  2015),  and  behavioural  and  cultural  tendencies  (e.g., consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and inequitable power structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations imply that attempt to  address  each  SDG  in  isolation,  or  as  independent  technical  challenges,  would  be  insufficient,  as would incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing the SDGs is likely to mean significant  disruption  of  long-standing  trends  and  transformative  progress  to  shift  development pathways  to  meet  all  the  SDGs,  including  climate  action,  beyond  incremental  changes  targeted  at addressing  mitigation  objectives  in  isolation.  In  other  words,  mitigation  conceived  as  incremental change is not enough. Transformational change has implications for equity in its multiple dimensions (Leach et al. 2018; Klinsky et al. 2017a; Steffen and Stafford Smith 2013) including just transitions (4.5). </span></div>

<div id="id16949"><span id="id16950" class="s1">Development priorities are reflected in the decisions that actors within societies make, such as policy choices by governments and parliaments at all levels, votes over competing policy platforms by citizens, or selection of issues that non-state actors push for. Multiple objectives range from poverty eradication to providing energy access, addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving health, cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining growth and providing jobs, among others. For example, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across many countries, such as Brazil (Grottera et al. 2017), Indonesia (Irfany and Klasen 2017), India (GoI, 2015), South  Africa  (Winkler  2018)  and  other  low-  and  middle-income  countries  (Dorband  et  al.  2019). Reducing inequality relates not only to income, but also to other dimensions such as in access to energy services (Tait 2017), gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles (Andrijevic et al. 2020), and thereby assumes relevance in both developing and developed countries. The development priorities of many poor  countries  and  communities  with  low  capacities  to  adapt,  has  been  focused  more  on  reducing poverty,  providing  basic  infrastructure,  education  and  improving  health,  rather  than  on  mitigation (Chimhowu et al. 2019). </span></div>

The  number  of countries with a national development plan has more than doubled, from about 62 in 2006 (World Bank 2007)  to  134  plans  published  between  2012  and  2018  (Chimhowu  et  al.  2019).  The  comeback  of planning  may  be  linked  to  increased  consideration  given  to  sustainability,  which  is  by  construction forward-looking and far ranging, and therefore requires state and civil society to prepare and implement plans  at  all  levels  of  governance.  Governments  are  increasingly  engaging  in  the  development  and formulation  of  national  plans  in  an  organised,  conscious  and  continual  attempt  to  select  the  best available alternatives to achieve specific goals.  </span></div>
<div id="id16991"><span id="id16992" class="s1">The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the earlier ones in terms of their approach. </span><span id="id16994" class="s1">Complexity  science  has  over  the  years  argued  for  new  forms  of  planning  based  on  contingency, behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (Colander and Kupers 2016; Ramalingam, 2013), and  new  plans  have  increasingly  focused  on  increasing  resilience  of  individuals,  organisations  and systems (Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013). Finally, alongside short-term (typically 5 year) plans with operational purpose, countries have also expressed visions of their development pathways over longer time horizons, via, e.g., Voluntary National Reviews submitted in the context of the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. </span></div>
<div id="id17002"><span id="id17003" class="s1">National development plans are also increasingly more holistic in their approach, linking closely with SDGs and incorporating climate action in their agendas.

This misses the point that development drives emissions, and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and policies that determine mitigation pathways (Munasinghe 2007). A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; Winkler 2017b), through multiple channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of development, degree of inequality, and population growth. </span></div>

A major component of the development pathway of a country is precisely the nature of the economic activities on which the country relies (e.g., agriculture and mining, heavy industry, services, high-tech products, etc.) as well as the way it articulates its economy with the rest of the World (e.g., export-led growth vs. import substitution strategies). Hence, the development pathway ultimately drives the underlying structure of the economy, and to a large degree the relationship between activity and GHG emissions. </span></div>
<div id="id17378"><span id="id17379" class="s1">Looking  ahead,  choices  about  the  nature  of  economic  activities  are  expected  to  have  significant implications for emissions. For example, a development pathway that focuses on enhancing economic growth based on manufacturing is likely to lead to very different challenges for mitigation compared to one that focuses on services-led growth. (Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018) find that choices about whether or not to export  offshore  oil  in  Brazil  will  have  significant  implications  for  the  country&#8217;s  GHG  emissions.

In fact, factors affecting household  consumption  based  emissions  include  household  size,  age,  education  attainment, employment status, urban vs rural location and housing stock (Druckman and Jackson 2015). There is evidence to indicate that at the household level, the increase in emissions from additional consumption of  the  lower  income  households  could  be  larger  than  the  reduction  in  emissions  from  the  drop  in consumption from the high income households (Sager 2019). Accordingly, as countries seek to fulfil the objective of reducing inequality, there are possibilities of higher increase in emissions (Sager 2019).  </span></div>

The  former  is  based  on  Shared  Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 1 (sustainable development), whereas the latter is based on SSP 2 (middle of the road). Comparing 1.5-Ren to 1.5-SP can thus be interpreted as a numerical translation of trying the reach the same  long-term  temperature  goal  without  and  with  shifting  development  pathways  towards sustainability. Data shows that the global price of carbon necessary to remain on target is 40%-50% </span><span id="id17575" class="s1">lower  in  the  latter  relative  to  the  former,  thus  indicating  that  mitigation  is  cheaper  with  a  shift  in development pathway towards sustainability.

The climate research community has developed the Shared Socio-economic  pathways  (SSPs)  that  link  several  socio-economic  drivers  including  equity  in  relation  to welfare, resources, institutions, governance and climate mitigation policies in order to reflect many of the  key  development  directions  (O&#8217;Neill  et  al.  2014).  In  most  modelling  exercises  however, development  remains  treated  as  an  exogenous  input.  In  addition,  models  may  capture  only  some dimensions of development that are relevant for mitigation options, thereby not capturing distributional aspects and not allowing consistency checks with broader developmental goals (Valadkhani et al. 2016). Quantitative  tools  for  assessing  mitigation  pathways  could  be  more  helpful  if  they  could  provide information  on  a  broader  range  of  development  indicators,  and  could  model  substantively  different alternative development paths, thereby providing information on which levers might shift development in a more sustainable direction. </span></div>
<div id="id17958"><span id="id17959" class="s1">Tools have been developed in that direction, for example in the Mitigation Action Plans and Scenarios (MAPS)  community  (La  Rovere  et  al.  2014b),  but  need  to  be  further  mainstreamed  in  the  analysis.

Back-casting  is  a  normative approach  where  modellers  construct  desirable  futures  and  specify  upfront  targets  and  then  find  out possible pathways to attain these targets (IPCC et al. 2001). Use of approaches like back-casting are useful not only in incorporating the long term national development objectives in the models, but also evaluating conflicts and synergies more effectively (van der Voorn et al. 2020). In back casting, the long-term national development objectives remain the key benchmarks guiding the model dynamics and  the  global  climate  goal  is  interfaced  to  realise  the  co-benefits.  The  models  then  delineate  the roadmap  of  national  actions  such  that  the  national  goals  are  achieved  with  a  comprehensive understanding of the full costs and benefits of low carbon development (often including the costs of adaptation  and  impacts  from  residual  climate  change).  Back-casting  modelling  exercises  show  that </span><span id="id17976" class="s1">aligning development and climate actions could result in much lower &#8216;social cost of carbon&#8217; (Shukla et al. 2008).

The modernization of agriculture in various national contexts fits such a mold. In the US, for example, major government investments in agricultural  innovation  through  the  creation  of  agricultural  universities  and  support  for  research provided advances in the technological basis for modernization. A network of agricultural extension services accelerated the popularization and uptake of modern methods. Infrastructure investments in irrigation and drainage made production more viable, and investment in roadways and rail for transport supported market formation. Agricultural development banks made credit available, and government subsidies improved the profitability for farmers and agricultural corporations. Public campaigns were launched to modify food habits (Ferleger 2000).  </span></div>

<div id="id18476"><span id="id18477" class="s101">1. What do we mean by development pathways? </span><span id="id18479" class="s1">In the present report, development pathways refer to patterns of development resulting from multiple decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether in  the  Global  North  or  the  Global  South  follows  its  own  pattern  of  development  (Figure 1.6). Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities). By extension, the concept can also be applied to sectors and systems (e.g., the development pathway of the agricultural </span><span id="id18485" class="s1">sector or of industrial systems). </span></div>

<div id="id18699"><span id="id18700" class="s1">In  the  absence  of  shifts  in  development  pathways,  conventional mitigation  policy  instruments  (e.g., carbon tax, emission quotas, technological norms, etc.) may not be able to limit emissions to a degree sufficient for deep decarbonisation or only at very high economic and social costs. </span></div>
<div id="id18704"><span id="id18705" class="s1">Policies to shift development pathways, on the contrary, make mitigation policies more effective. For example, policies that prioritise non-car transit, or limit rents close to work places would make it easier for households to relocate in response to a price signal on transport, and thus makes the same degree of mitigation achievable at lower economic and social cost. </span></div>
<div id="id18710"><span id="id18711" class="s1096">2b. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between development objectives and mitigation </span><span id="id18714" class="s1">Second, societies pursue a variety of development objectives, of which protecting the Earth&#8217;s climate is part. The SDGs provide a global mapping of these goals. Absent climate mitigation, our collective ability to achieve the SDGs in 2030 and to sustain them beyond 2030 is likely to be compromised, even if adaptation measures are put in place (WGII). </span></div>
<div id="id18719"><span id="id18720" class="s1">There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of other development objectives can go hand in hand, in the near-, mid- and long-term (3.7, 6.7.7, 7.6.5, 8.2, 9.8, 10.1.1, 11.5.3, 17.3) (Figures 3.40, 12.1). For example, transitions from coal-based power to lower-emissions  electricity  generation technologies  and  from  Internal  Combustion  Engine  to  lower-carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local air pollution (Box 6.2, 10.4.1). Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also delivers significant health benefits (9.8.1 and 9.8.2).  </span></div>
<div id="id18728"><span id="id18729" class="s1">Careful design of mitigation policies is critical to achieving these synergies (13.8). Integrated policies can support the creation of synergies between climate change goals and other SDGs. For example, when measures  promoting  walkable  urban  areas  are  combined  with  electrification  and  clean  renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained (5.2, Figure SPM.8).

<div id="id18837"><span id="id18838" class="s1">Prioritising is one way to manage trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards sustainability  as  they  expand  the  range  of  tools  available  to  simultaneously  achieve  multiple development  objectives,  including mitigation.  In  the city  example  of  section  2a,  a  carbon  tax alone would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high emissions transport modes poorer or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing and provision of safe low-carbon mobility  could  both  facilitate  equitable  access  to  housing  (a  major  development  objective  in  many countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway. </span></div>
<div id="id18848"><span id="id18849" class="s1">Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), driven  by  targeted  policies,  investment  and  enabling  socio-cultural  and  behavioural  change,  would reduce  pressure  on  supply  side  mitigation  need,  hence  limiting  pressure  on  water  and  food  and  the achievement of associated SDGs. Some studies assume Western European lifestyle as a reference for the  global  North  and  an  improvement  in  the  living  standard  for  the  Global  South  to  reduce  energy </span><span id="id18855" class="s1">demand and emissions (e.g., (Grubler et al. 2018)), while others explore a transformative change in the global North to achieve a decent living standard for all (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Bertram et al. 2018) (3.7.8).

<div id="id19068"><span id="id19069" class="s1096">4. How to shift development pathways? </span><span id="id19071" class="s1">Shifting development paths is complex. If history is any guide, practices that can easily supplant existing </span><span id="id19073" class="s1">systems  and  are  clearly  profitable  move  fastest  (Griliches  1957).  Changes  that  involve  &#8216;dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components&#8217; take more time, acceptance and legitimation and  involve  complex  social  learning  (Conley  and  Udry  2010),  even  when  they  promise  large  gains (Pezzoni et al. 2019). </span></div>
<div id="id19078"><span id="id19079" class="s1">Yet despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers,  citizens,  the  private  sector  and  social  stakeholders.  For  example,  fundamentally  different responses  to  the  first  oil  shock  shifted  then-comparable  economies  on  to  different  energy  sector development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (Sathaye et al. 2009). More recent examples have shown evidence of voluntary transitions for e.g., advanced lighting in Sweden, improved cook-stoves in China, liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia or ethanol vehicles in Brazil  (Sovacool 2016).  </span></div>
<div id="id19088"><span id="id19089" class="s1">There is no one-size-fits-all recipe for shifting development pathways. However, the following insights can be drawn from past experience and scenarios of possible future development pathways (4.4.1).</span><span id="id19092" class="s1">For example, policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and affordable reduce transport </span><span id="id19095" class="s1">costs for low- and middle-income households, and also reduce transport emissions (4.4.1.9). Shifts in development  pathways  result  from  both  sustained  political  interventions  and  bottom-up  changes  in public opinion. No single sector or policy action is enough to achieve this. Coordinated policy mixes would need to coordinate multiple actors &#8211; i.e., individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions  and  infrastructure  actors  &#8211;  to  deepen  decarbonisation  and  shift  pathways  towards sustainability (Pettifor 2020). One example was the LPG Subsidy ("Zero Kero") Program in Indonesia which  harnessed  creative  policy  design  to  shift  to  cleaner  energy  by  overcoming  existing  private interests. The objective of decreasing fiscal expenditures on domestic kerosene subsidies by replacing it  with  LPG  was  achieved  by  harnessing  distribution  networks  of  existing  providers  supported  by </span><span id="id19105" class="s1">government subsidized provision of equipment and subsidized pricing (Cross-Chapter Box 9). </span></div>
<div id="id19107"><span id="id19108" class="s1">Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements or informal lifestyle changes underpins system change (5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5.3, 13.5).  </span></div>

These might include the globally declining costs of renewables (Fig.1.7, 2.2.5, Box 16.2), emerging social norms for climate mitigation (Green and Denniss 2018), or the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which might be harnessed to centre political action on protecting human and planetary health (B&#252;chs et al. 2020), but if not handled carefully could also risk to undermine the support for transformation. </span></div>
<div id="id19217"><span id="id19218" class="s1096">5. How can shifts in development pathways be implemented by actors in different contexts? </span><span id="id19220" class="s1">Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability is a shared aspiration. Yet since countries differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent needs  in  terms  of  facilitating  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities (4.3.2, 17.4). The appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities. </span></div>
<div id="id19226"><span id="id19227" class="s1">In  some  developed  countries  and  communities,  affluence  leads  to  high  levels  of  consumption  and emissions across sectors (Wiedmann et al. 2020; Mazur and Rosa 1974). For some countries, reducing consumption can reduce emissions without compromising on wellbeing. However, some developing countries  still  face  the  challenge  of  escaping  &#8220;middle-income  traps&#8221;  (Ag&#233;nor  and  Canuto  2015),  as labour-saving  technological  change  and  globalisation  have  limited  options  to  develop  via  the manufacturing  sector  (Altenburg  and  Rodrik  2017).  In  least  developed  countries,  infrastructure, industry, and public services are still being established, posing both a challenge to financial support to deploy  technologies,  and  large  opportunities  to  support  accelerating  low-to-zero  carbon  options (especially in terms of efficient and sufficient provision, (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020)). Availability </span><span id="id19237" class="s1">of  capital,  or  lack  thereof,  is  a  critical  discriminant  across  countries  and  requires  international cooperation (15.2.2). </span></div>

As  highlighted  above,  despite  30  years  of  UNFCCC  and  growing contributions  by  non-state  actors,  the  emissions  gap  keeps  growing  (4.2.2  and  4.2.3).  Mitigation conceived as incremental change is not enough. Meeting ambitious mitigation goals entails rapid, non-</span><span id="id19490" class="s1">marginal changes in production and consumption patterns (4.2.4 and 4.2.5). Taking another approach, we have seen in section 4.3 that shifting development pathways broadens the scope for mitigation (4.3.1, 4.3.2) and offers more opportunities than mitigation alone to combine mitigation with the realisation of other SDGs (4.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5).  </span></div>

Since development pathways result from a myriad of decisions from multiple actors (4.3.1), coordination across countries and with non-state actors is essential.  </span></div>

<div id="id19590"><span id="id19591" class="s1">The present chapter uses the set of enabling conditions identified in the IPCC  SR1.5 report, namely policy,  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  finance,  behaviour  and  lifestyles  and  innovation  and technology (de Coninck et al. 2018). As Figure 4.8 illustrates, </span><span id="id19594" class="s103">public policies</span><span id="id19595" class="s1"> are required to foster both accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways. They are also vital to guide and provide the other enabling conditions (cf. Table 4.12). Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity facilitate the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways, with the potential  to  achieve  multiple  mitigation  and  development  objectives.  Finance  is  required  both  to accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. Chapter 15 argues that near-term actions to shift the financial system over the next decade (2021-2030) are critically important and feasible, and that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities to scale up financing from billions to trillions  (15.6.7)  (Mawdsley  2018).  As  discussed  in  section  4.2.5,  accelerated  mitigation  pathways encompass both rapid deployment of new technologies such as CCS or electric vehicles, as well as changes in consumption patterns: rapid deployment of mitigation </span><span id="id19606" class="s103">technology</span><span id="id19607" class="s1"> and </span><span id="id19608" class="s103">behaviour change</span><span id="id19609" class="s1"> are thus two enabling conditions to accelerated mitigation. Dynamics of deployment of technologies are relatively well known, pointing to specific, short-term action to accelerate innovation and deployment (Cross-Chapter  Box  12),  whereas  dynamics  of  collective  behaviour  change  is  less  well  understood. Arguably, the latter also facilitates shifting development pathways.  </span></div>

<div id="id19793"><span id="id19794" class="s1">The rest of the section is organised as follows. Policy packages that combine climate and development policies are first discussed (4.4.1.2). The next sections are dedicated to the conditions that facilitate shifts  in  development  pathways  and  accelerated  mitigation:  governance  and  institutions  (4.4.1.3), financial resources (4.4.1.4),  behaviour  change  (4.4.1.5)  and innovation (4.4.1.6).  Four  examples  of how climate and development policies can be combined to shift pathways and accelerate mitigation are then presented (4.4.1.7, 4.4.1.8, 4.4.1.9 and 4.4.1.10). Section 4.4.2 focuses specifically on how shifts in development pathways can deliver both mitigation and adaptation. Finally, 4.4.3 discusses risks and uncertainties associated with combining shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation. </span></div>
<div id="id19803"><span id="id19804" class="s1096">4.4.1.2</span><span id="id19806" class="s1096">Policy packages that include climate and development policies </span><span id="id19808" class="s1">Although  many  transformations  in  the  past  have  been  driven  by  the  emergence and  diffusion  of  an innovative technology, policy intervention was frequent, especially in the more rapid ones (Grubb et al. 2021;  Michaelowa  et  al.  2018).  Likewise,  it  is  not  expected  that  spontaneous  behaviour  change  or market evolution alone yield the type of transformations outlined in the accelerated mitigation pathways described in 4.2.5, or in the shifts in development pathways described in 4.3.3. On the contrary, stringent temperature targets imply bold policies in the short term (Rockstr&#246;m et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018) to enforce effective existing policy instruments and regulations, as well as to reform or remove harmful existing policies and subsidies (D&#237;az et al. 2019). </span></div>
<div id="id19817"><span id="id19818" class="s1">Policy integration, addressing multiple objectives, is an essential component of shifting development pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation  (</span><span id="id19820" class="s103">robust  evidence,  high  agreement</span><span id="id19821" class="s1">).  A  shift  in  development pathways  that  fosters  accelerated  mitigation  may  best  be  achieved  through  integrated  actions  that comprise policies in support of the broader SDG agenda, based on country-specific priorities (4.3.2, 13.8, 13.9). These may include for example, fiscal policies, or integrating industrial (Nilsson et al. 2021) and energy policies (Fragkos et al. 2021) with climate policies. Similarly, sectoral transitions that aspire to shifting development pathways towards sustainability often have multiple objectives, and deploy a diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Cross-Chapter Box 5). </span></div>
<div id="id19829"><span id="id19830" class="s1">Because  low-carbon  transitions  are  political  processes,  analyses  are  needed  </span><span id="id19831" class="s103">of</span><span id="id19832" class="s1">  policy  as  well  as  </span><span id="id19833" class="s103">for</span><span id="id19834" class="s1"> policy  (13.6).

Case studies of successes and failures in sustainable development and mitigation offer equally important insights. Both theoretical  and  empirical  analysis  reinforce  the  argument  that  single  policy  instruments  are  not sufficient (</span><span id="id19845" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id19846" class="s1">). Policymakers might rather mobilise a range of policies, such as financial instruments (taxes, subsidies, grants, loans), regulatory instruments (standards, laws, performance targets) and processual instruments (demonstration projects, network management, public debates, consultations, foresight exercises, roadmaps) (Vo&#223; et al. 2007).

Improved institutions and governance enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation gaps (</span><span id="id19992" class="s103">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id19993" class="s1">). Improving institutions involve a broad range of stakeholders and multiple regional and temporal scales.  It necessitates a credible and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and losers  and  adopting  compensatory  measures  to  ensure  an  inclusive  and  just  transition  (Newell  and Mulvaney  2013;  Miller  and  Richter  2014;  Diffenbaugh  and  Burke  2019;  Gambhir  et  al.  2018), managing the risk of inequitable or non-representative power dynamics and avoiding regulatory capture by special interests (Helsinki Design Lab 2014; Kahane 2019; Boulle et al. 2015). </span></div>
<div id="id20001"><span id="id20002" class="s1">Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions  (Stiglitz 1998). For example,  shift away from fossil fuel-based energy economy could significantly disrupt the status quo, leading to a stranding of financial and capital assets and shifting of political-economic power. Ensuring the decision-making process  is  not  unduly  influenced  by  actors  with  much  to  lose  is  key  to  managing  a  transformation. Effective governance, as noted in Chapter 13, requires establishing strategic direction, coordination of policy responses, and mediation among divergent interests.  Among varieties of climate governance, which institutions emerge is path-dependent, based on the interplay of national political institutions, international drivers, and bureaucratic structures (Dubash 2021). Focused national climate institutions to address these challenges are more likely to emerge, persist and be effective when they are consistent with a framing of climate change that has broad national political support (</span><span id="id20013" class="s103">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span id="id20015" class="s1">) (4.5, 13.2, 13.5).  </span></div>

An example is changes in investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with pressures to disinvest in the former while increasing levels of &#8216;green finance&#8217; (6.7.4,  15.5).  While  some  lower-carbon  technologies  have  become  competitive  (1.4.3,  2.5),  support remains needed for the low-emissions options have higher costs per unit of service provided than high-emission  ones.  Lack  of financial  resources is  identified  as  a major  barrier to  the  implementation  of accelerated mitigation and of shifts in development pathways. Overcoming this obstacle has two major components. One relates to private capital. The other to public finance. </span></div>
<div id="id20140"><span id="id20141" class="s1">There is substantial amount of research on the redirection of private financial flows towards low-carbon investment and the role of financial regulators and central banks, as detailed in Chapter 15. Financial systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition (Fankhauser et al. 2016; Naidoo 2020). Policy frameworks can re-direct financial resources towards low-emission assets and services (UNEP 2015), mainstreaming climate finance within financial and banking system regulation, and reducing transaction costs for bankable mitigation technology projects (Mundaca et al. 2013; Brunner and Enting 2014; Yeo 2019). Shifts in the financial system to finance climate mitigation and other SDGs can be achieved by aligning incentives and investments with multiple objectives (UNEP Inquiry 2016). </span></div>
<div id="id20150"><span id="id20151" class="s1">Different  approaches  have  been  explored  to  improve  such  alignment  (15.6),  from  national  credit policies  to  directly  green  mainstream  financial  regulations  (e.g.,  through  modifications  in  the  Basel rules for banks). For all approaches, an essential precondition is to assess and monitor the contribution </span><span id="id20155" class="s1">of financial flows to climate and sustainability goals, with better metrics that clearly link with financial activity (Chenet et al. 2019). Enabling the alignment of investment decision-making with achieving climate  and  broader  sustainability goals includes  acknowledgment  and  disclosure  of  climate-change related risk and of risks associated with mitigation in financial portfolios. Current disclosures remain far from the scale the markets need to channel investment to sustainable and resilient solutions (UNEP - Finance Initiative 2020; Clark et al. 2018; Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 2019; IPCC 2018b). Disclosure, however, is not enough (Ameli et al. 2020). In addition, climate targets can be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs for financial institutions, both at national and  international  level.  Financing  needs  are  usable  for  financial  institutions,  to  inform  portfolio allocation decisions and financing priorities (Chenet et al. 2019). At the international level, for example, </span><span id="id20166" class="s1">technology roadmaps for key sectors can be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs, as shown by existing experiences in energy and industrial sectors (Chenet et al. 2019; WBSCD 2018; International Energy Agency 2015) </span><span id="id20170" class="s101">Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute </span></div>

<div id="id20354"><span id="id20355" class="s1">Overall, early action is needed to overcome barriers and to adjust the existing i..ncentive system to align national development strategies with climate and sustainable development goals in the medium-term. Steckel  et  al.  (2017)  conclude  that  climate  finance  could  become  a  central  pillar  of  sustainable development by reconciling the global goal of cost-efficient mitigation with national policy priorities. Without a more rapid, scaled redeployment of financing, in development trajectories that hinder the realisation of the global goals will be locked in (Zadek and Robins 2016). Investment might be designed to avoid trading off the Paris goals against other SDGs, as well as those that simultaneously reduce poverty, inequality, and emissions (Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). </span></div>

To do so,  pricing  carbon&#8212;either  through  tax  payments  based  on  the  level  of  emissions  or  cap-and-trade systems that limit total allowable emissions&#8212;is an efficient means of discouraging carbon emissions throughout  an  economy  (both  in  consumption  and  production)  while  simultaneously  encouraging  a switch to non-carbon energy sources and generating revenues for prioritised actions (13.6.3).

Fiscal space may therefore also need to stem from other  sources, although fiscal reforms are complex endeavours (4.4.1.8). For countries at lower income levels, foreign aid can make an important contribution to the same agenda (Kharas and McArthur 2019).It may also be noted that, according to estimates at the global level, military spending amounted  to  USD1.748  trillion  in  2012  (the  last  year  with  data),  a  figure  that  corresponded  to  2.3 percent of GDP, 55 percent of government spending in education, and was 13 times the level of net </span><span id="id20400" class="s1">ODA (World Bank 2020; SIPRI 2020). Given this, moderate reductions in military spending (which may  involve  conflict  resolution  and  cross-country  agreements  on  arms  limitations)  could  free  up considerable resources for the SDG agenda, both in the countries that reduce spending and in the form of ODA. The resolution of conflicts within and between countries before they become violent would also reduce the need for public and private spending repairing human and physical damage. The fact that  civil  wars  are  common  in  the  countries  that  face  the  severest  SDG  challenges  underscores  the importance of this issue (Collier 2007 pp.17-37).  </span></div>

<div id="id20544"><span id="id20545" class="s1">Individual motivation and capacity are impacted by different factors that go beyond traditional social, demographic and economic predictors. However, it is unclear to what extent behavioural factors (i.e., cognitive, motivational and contextual aspects) are taken into account in policy design (Mundaca et al. 2019; Dubois et al. 2019). In fact, while economic policies play a significant role in influencing people&#8217;s decisions and behaviour, many drivers of human behaviour and values work largely outside the market system  (D&#237;az  et  al.  2019;  Winkler  et  al.  2015)  as  actors  in  society,  particularly  individuals,  do  not respond  in  an  economically  &#8216;rational&#8217;  manner  based  on  perfect-information  cost-benefit  analyses (Shiller 2019; Runge 1984). Rather, compelling narratives can drive individuals to adopt new norms and  policies.  And  norms  can  be  more  quickly  and  more  robustly  shifted  by  proposing  and  framing policies designed with awareness of how framings interact with individual cognitive tendencies (van der Linden et al. 2015). Transformative policies are thus much more likely to be successfully adopted and  lead  to  long-term  behavioural  change  if  designed  in  accordance  with  principles  of  cognitive psychology (van der Linden et al. 2015), and with the deep understanding of decision-making offered by behavioural science (UNEP 2017b). Similarly, given that present bias&#8212;being motivated by costs and benefits that take effect immediately than those delivered later&#8212;significantly shapes behaviour, schemes that bring forward distant costs into the present or that upfront incentives have proved to be more  effective  (Zauberman  et  al.  2009;  van  den  Broek  et  al.  2017;  Safarzy&#324;ska  2018).  Overall, transformational  strategies  that  align  mitigation  with  subjective  life  satisfaction,  and  build  societal support by positive discourses about economic, social, and cultural benefits of low-carbon innovations, promises far more success than targeting mitigation alone (Asensio and Delmas 2016; WBGU 2011; Geels et al. 2017). </span></div>
<div id="id20567"><span id="id20568" class="s1">Climate actions are related to knowledge but even strongly to motivational factors (Hornsey et al. 2016; Bolderdijk et al. 2013; Boomsma and Steg 2014), which explains the gap between awareness and action (&#220;nal et al. 2018). Social influences, particularly from peers, affect people&#8217;s engagement in climate action  (Schelly  2014).  Role  models  appear  to  have  a  solid  basis  in  people&#8217;s  everyday  preferences (WBGU  2011).  Social  norms  can  reinforce  individuals&#8217;  underlying  motivations  and  be  effective  in encouraging  sustainable  consumption  patterns,  as  many  examples  offered  by  behavioural  science illustrate. Social networks also influence and spread behaviours (Service et al. 2014; Clayton et al. 2015; Farrow et al. 2017; Shah et al. 2019). These social influences can be harnessed by climate policy. </span></div>
<div id="id20577"><span id="id20578" class="s1">Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements or informal lifestyle movements underpins system change (</span><span id="id20580" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id20581" class="s1">) (5.4, 5.5). Organisations are comprised of individuals,  but  also  become  actors  in  their  own  right.  Recent  literature  has  considered  the  role  of </span><span id="id20584" class="s1">coalitions  and  social  movements  in  energy  democracy  and  energy  transitions  towards  sustainability (Hess 2018). Other scholars have examined the role of women in redistributing power, both in the sense of  energy  transition  and  in  terms  of  gender  relations  (Allen  et  al.  2019;  Routledge  et  al.  2018). Mitigation  and  broader  sustainable  development  policies  that  facilitate  active  participation  by stakeholders  can  build  trust,  forge  new  social  contracts,  and  contribute  to  a  positive  cycle  building climate governance capacity (5.2.3). </span></div>
<div id="id20591"><span id="id20592" class="s1">However, behavioural change not embedded in structural change will contribute little to climate change mitigation,  suggesting  that  behavioural  change  is  not  only  a  function  of  individual  agency  but  also depends  on  other  enabling  factors,  such  as  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and  institutions  (5.4). </span><span id="id20596" class="s1">Successful  shifts  towards  public  transport,  for  example,  involve  technologies  (buses,  trams), infrastructure (light rail, dedicated bus lanes), regulations (operational licenses, performance contracts), </span></div>

As part of its key role in technological change, R&amp;D can make a crucial contribution to accelerated mitigation up to 2030 and beyond, among other things  by  focusing  on  closing  technology  gaps  that  stand  in  the  way  of  decarbonising  today&#8217;s  high emitting  sectors.  Such  sectors  include  shipping,  trucking,  aviation  and  heavy  industries  like  steel, cement and chemicals. More broadly, it is increasingly clear that digital changes are becoming a key driving force in societal transformation (Tegmark 2017). Digitalisation is not only an &#8220;instrument&#8221; for resolving  sustainability  challenges,  it  is  also  a  fundamental  driver  of  disruptive,  multiscalar  change (Sachs et al. 2019) that amounts to a shift in development pathway. Information and communication technologies, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, robotics, are  not  usually  categorised  as  climate  technologies,  but  have a  potential  impact on  GHG  emissions (OECD 2017b) (Cross-Chapter Box 11).  </span></div>
<div id="id20741"><span id="id20742" class="s1">The direction of innovation matters (</span><span id="id20743" class="s103">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id20744" class="s1">). The research community has called for more &#8220;responsible innovation&#8221; (Pandza and Ellwood 2013), &#8220;open innovation&#8221; (Rauter et al. 2019), &#8220;mission-oriented&#8221; innovation (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017), &#8220;holistic innovation&#8221; (Chen et al.  2018b),  &#8220;next-generation  innovation  policy&#8221;  (Kuhlmann  and  Rip  2018)  or  &#8220;transformative innovation&#8221; (Schot and Steinmueller 2018) so that innovation patterns and processes are commensurate to our growing sustainability challenges. There is a growing recognition that new forms of innovation can be harnessed and coupled to climate objectives (Fagerberg et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018). As such, innovation  and  sociotechnical  change  can  be  channelled  to  intensify  mitigation  via  &#8220;deliberate acceleration&#8221; (Roberts et al. 2018a) and &#8220;coalition building&#8221; (Hess 2018).  </span></div>
<div id="id20754"><span id="id20755" class="s1">Innovation goes beyond technology. For example, decarbonisation in sectors with long lived capital stock  (such  as  heavy  industry,  buildings,  transport  infrastructure)  entail  technology,  policy  and financing innovations (Bataille 2020). Similarly, expanding the deployment of photovoltaics can draw upon policies that support specific technical innovations (e.g., to improve photovoltaics efficiency), or innovations in regulatory and market regimes (e.g., net-metering), to innovations in social organisation (e.g., community-ownership). System innovation is a core focus of the transitions literature (Grin et al. 2010; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017). Accelerating low carbon transitions not only involves a shift  of  system  elements  but  also  underlying  routines  and  rules,  and  hence  transitions  shift  the directionality of innovation. They hence concern the development of a new paradigm or regime that is more focused on solving sustainability challenges that cannot be solved within the dominant regime </span><span id="id20766" class="s1">they substitute (Cross-Chapter Box 12).  </span></div>
<div id="id20768"><span id="id20769" class="s1">Several studies have pointed at the important possible contributions of grassroots innovators for the start-up of sustainability transitions (Seyfang and Smith 2007; Smith et al. 2016; Seyfang et al. 2014). In particular, a range of studies have shown that users can play a variety of roles in promoting system innovation: shielding, nurturing (including learning, networking and visioning) and empowering the niches in relation to the dominant system and regime (Schot et al. 2016; Randelli and Rocchi 2017; Meelen et al. 2019). More fundamentally, innovation regimes can be led and guided by markets driven by monetizable profits (as much of private sector led technological innovation of patentable intellectual property), or prioritise social returns (e.g., innovation structures such as innovation prizes, public sector </span><span id="id20778" class="s1">innovation, investments in human capital, and socially-beneficial intellectual property regimes). In both cases, public policies can play a key role by providing resources and favourable incentives (IEA 2020). Chapter 16 provides more details on ways to foster innovation. </span></div>

Patterns of growth have differed markedly across regions, with newly emerging East Asian economies building  on  transition  to  manufacturing&#8212;as  China  has  done  in  the  past&#8212;while  Latin  American countries tend to transition directly from primary sector to services (Rodrik 2016), and African countries tend to rely on productivity improvements in the primary sectors (Diao et al. 2019). Yet many countries still face the challenge of getting out of the &#8220;middle-income trap&#8221; (Ag&#233;nor and Canuto 2015), as labour-saving technological change and globalisation have limited options to develop via the manufacturing sector (Altenburg and Rodrik 2017). </span></div>
<div id="id20921"><span id="id20922" class="s1">Looking ahead, several studies have illustrated how structural change towards sustainability could lead to reduced emissions intensity and higher mitigative capacity. In China, for example, the shift away from heavy industry (to light industry and services) has already been identified as the most important force limiting emissions growth (Guan et al. 2018), and as a major factor for future emissions (Kwok et al. 2018). </span></div>
<div id="id20928"><span id="id20929" class="s1">Overall,  Altenburg  et  al.  (2017)  argue  that  reallocation  of  capital  and  labour  from  low-  to  high-productivity sectors&#8212;i.e., structural change&#8212;remains a necessity, and that it is possible to combine it with reduced environmental footprint (including, but not limited to, mitigation). They argue that this dual challenge calls for structural transformation policies different from those implemented in the past, most importantly through a &#8220;systematic steering of investment behaviour in a socially agreed direction&#8221; and encompassing policy coordination (</span><span id="id20935" class="s103">limited evidence, medium agreement</span><span id="id20936" class="s1">). </span></div>
<div id="id20938"><span id="id20939" class="s1">In order to permit progress on their SDG agendas, it is essential that countries develop visions of their future decarbonised sectoral production structure, including its ability to generate growth in incomes, employment and foreign exchange earnings. as well as the related spatial distribution of production, employment,  and  housing.  To  this  extent,  governance  and  institutional  capacity  matter,  such  as availability of tools to support long-term planning. A sectoral structure that permits strong growth is essential given strong associations between growth in per-capita incomes and progress on most SDGs (including those related to poverty; health; education; and access to water, sanitation, electricity, and roads; but not income equality), in part due to the fact that higher incomes provide both households and governments with resources that at least in part would be used to promote SDGs (Gable et al. 2015). </span></div>
<div id="id20949"><span id="id20950" class="s1">The  future  viability  of  sectors  will  depend  on  the  extent  to  which  they  can  remain  profitable  while relying on lower-carbon energy. The challenge to identify alternative sectors of growth is particularly acute for countries that today depend on oil and natural gas for most of their foreign exchange and government  revenues  (Mirzoev  et  al.  2020).  Changes  in  economic  structure  will  also  have  gender implications since the roles of men and women vary across sectors. For example, in many developing </span><span id="id20956" class="s1">countries, sectors in which women play a relatively important role, including agriculture and unpaid household services like collection of water and fuel wood, may be negatively affected by climate change (Roy 2018). It may thus be important to take complementary actions to address the gender implications of changes in economic structure.  </span></div>
<div id="id20961"><span id="id20962" class="s1">Given  strong  complementarities  between  policies  discussed  above,  an  integrated  policy  approach  is crucial. For example, as suggested, the actions that influence the pace at which GHG emissions can be cut  with  political  support  may  depend  on  taxation  (including  carbon  taxes),  investments  in infrastructure,  spending  on  R&amp;D,  changes  in  income  distribution  (influenced  by  transfers),  and </span><span id="id20967" class="s1">communication. In this light, it is important to consider the demands that alternative policy packages put  on  government  policy-making  efficiency  and  credibility  as  well  as  the  roles  of  other  enabling conditions.

<div id="id21109"><span id="id21110" class="s1">In many countries, fiscal systems are currently under stress to provide resources for the implementation of development priorities, such as, for example, providing universal health coverage and other social services (Meheus and McIntyre 2017) or sustainably funding pension systems in the context of aging populations (Asher and Bali 2017; Cruz-Martinez 2018). Overall, Baum et al. (2017) argue that low-income countries are likely not to have the fiscal space to undertake the investment entailed in reaching the SDGs. To create additional fiscal space, major options include improving tax recovery, reducing subsidies and levying additional taxes. </span></div>
<div id="id21118"><span id="id21119" class="s1">Mitigation  offers  an  opportunity  to  create  additional  fiscal  space,  and  thus  to  serve  the  objectives outlined above, by creating a new source of revenue for the government via carbon taxation or emissions permit auctioning and by reducing existing expenditures via reduction in subsidies to fossil-fuel. The 1991 tax reform in Sweden is an early example in which environmental taxation (including, but not limited to, fossil fuel taxation) was introduced as part of a package primarily aimed at lowering the marginal tax  rates  (more  than  80% at  the  time), at  reducing  other taxes,  while  keeping  most  of  the welfare  state.  To  do  so,  the  tax  base  was  broadened,  including  through  environmental  and  carbon taxation (Sterner 2007). Once in place, the carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and its base broadened (Criqui et al. 2019). </span></div>
<div id="id21129"><span id="id21130" class="s1">The  future potential for  using carbon taxation as a  way  to  provide space for  fiscal  reform  has  been highlighted in the so-called &#8220;green fiscal reform&#8221; literature (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2019). The potential is large, since only 13 percent of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing schemes in 2019 (Watts et al. 2019) and since many countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon prices hope to promote. In 2018, the  global  subsidy  value  amounted  to  $427  billion,  i.e.,  some  10  times  the  payment  for  carbon  use (Watts et al. 2019). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal space varies strongly across countries given differences in terms of current carbon prices and fuel subsidies. </span></div>
<div id="id21139"><span id="id21140" class="s1">The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing may be explained by the fact that most of the gains occur in the future and depend on actions across the globe, making them seem abstract and unpredictable, whereas the costs in the form of higher carbon prices are immediate  (Karapin 2016). Furthermore, the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear to the public who, in addition, may not trust that the government will use budgetary savings according to stated plans. The latter  may  be  due  to  various  factors,  including  a  history  of  limited  government  commitment  and </span><span id="id21147" class="s1">corruption (Maestre-Andr&#233;s et al 2019 ; Withana &amp; Sirini 2016; Chadwick 2017). </span></div>

Performance assessment is complicated by the effect of other policies and exogenous factors. (Haites  2018)  suggests  that  since  2008,  other  policies  have  probably  contributed  more  to  emission reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to achieve mitigation objectives. Emissions under ETSs have declined, with the exception of four systems without emissions caps (ibid). Every jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other policies that affect its GHG emissions. </span></div>

<div id="id21290"><span id="id21291" class="s1">Part of the losses (and related calls for compensation or exemptions) due to carbon pricing are related to the fact that it hurts the competitiveness of sectors that face imports from countries with lower carbon prices,  leading  to  &#8220;carbon  leakage&#8221;  if  carbon-intensive  production  (and  related  jobs)  migrates  from countries with relatively high carbon prices. Research confirms that a border carbon tax (or adjustment), set on the basis of the carbon content of the import, including a downward adjustment on the basis of any carbon payments (taxes or other) already made before entry, could reduce carbon leakage while also raising additional revenue and encouraging carbon pricing in the exporting country (Withana &amp; Sirini 2016; Cosbey et al  2019). </span></div>
<div id="id21300"><span id="id21301" class="s1">The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), as  well as momentum  from  climate actions  by other  countries and international  climate  agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al 2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon  energy:  when  they  are  low,  consumer  resistance  would  be  smaller  since  prices  will  remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow-down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Withana &amp; Sirini 2016). In countries that exports carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers. </span></div>
<div id="id21312"><span id="id21313" class="s1">There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers  or  earmarked  for  areas  with  positive  environmental  effects  (e.g.,  (Bachus  et  al.  2019)  for Belgium,  and  (Beiser-McGrath  and  Bernauer  2019)  for  Germany  and  the  USA),  as  well  as  on  the difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic consequences thereof) associated with the introduction of such instruments (Pereira et al. 2016). Similarly, &#8220;best practice&#8221; have been drawn from past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (Sovacool 2017; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). Specific policies, however, depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, employment, and trade, and institutional structure (including the functioning of markets and government capacity) (Kettner et al. 2019). As noted in Section 4.2.6, macroeconomic analysis finds that the overall economic implications of carbon pricing differ markedly depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing are used, and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for double dividend if the proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the most distortive taxes in the economy. </span></div>
<div id="id21327"><span id="id21328" class="s1">In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and may  not  be  sufficient  to  address  the  other  objectives  pursued.  Even  if  the  carbon  price  is  high,  the revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are eliminated. For example, Jakob et al. (2016) find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet a small part of their infrastructure spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak </span><span id="id21338" class="s1">of 0.93 percent in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric ton of CO</span><span id="id21339" class="s10">2</span><span id="id21340" class="s1">, to 0.48 per cent in 2018, when  the rate  had reached  USD132  (Jonsson  et  al.  2020;  Statistics  Sweden  2020).  This  means that governments that want to avoid a decline in the GDP share for total tax revenues over time would have </span></div>

However, it is here important to note that domestic tax hikes are likely  to  involve  trade-offs  since,  at  the  same  time  as  the  spending  they  fund  may  provide  various benefits, they may also reduce the capacity of households and the private sector to consume and invest, something that may reduce growth over time and reduced resources for spending in support of human development (Lofgren et al. 2013). It is also worth emphasising that restructuring of the fiscal system amount to changes in the social contract of the society (Combet and Hourcade 2017, 2014), and thus represents a major economic and social decision. </span></div>

<div id="id21485"><span id="id21486" class="s1">The spatial distribution of households and firms across urban and rural areas is a central characteristic of development pathways. Patterns of urbanisation, territorial development, and regional integration have wide-ranging implications for economic, social and environmental objectives (World Bank 2009). Notably, choices regarding spatial forms of development have large-scale implications for demand for transportation and associated GHG emissions. </span></div>
<div id="id21492"><span id="id21493" class="s1">Exclusionary  mechanisms  such  as  decreasing  accessibility  and  affordability  of  inner-urban neighbourhoods  is  a  major  cause  of  suburbanisation  of  low-  to  middle-income  households  (e.g., (Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018). Suburbanisation, in turn, is associated with higher transportation demand (Bento et al. 2005) and higher carbon footprints for households (Jones and Kammen 2014). Similarly,  other  studies  find  a  significant  positive  link  between  housing  prices  and  energy  demand (Lampin et al. 2013). </span></div>
<div id="id21500"><span id="id21501" class="s1">Reducing emissions from transport in cities through traditional climate policy instruments (e.g., through a carbon tax) is more difficult when inner-urban neighbourhoods are less accessible and less affordable, because exclusionary mechanisms act as a countervailing force to the rising transportation costs induced by the climate policy, pushing households outwards rather than inwards. Said differently, the costs of mitigating intra-city transportation emissions are higher when inner-urban housing prices are higher (Lampin et al. 2013). </span></div>
<div id="id21508"><span id="id21509" class="s1">This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable can  open  up  broader  opportunities  for  suburban  households  to  relocate  in  the  face  of  increasing transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and middle-income households, who spend a greater portion of their income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be locked into locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs&#8212;e.g., households feeling helpless in front of rising fuel prices&#8212;and the economic costs of mitigation policies&#8212;as a lower price of carbon is likely to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust. </span></div>
<div id="id21518"><span id="id21519" class="s1">Making  inner-cities  neighbourhoods  more  accessible  and  more  affordable  is  a  complex  endeavour (Benner and Karner 2016). At the same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for a range of social, health and economic reasons. Revenues derived from climate policies could provide additional resources to support such programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use their revenues towards low-income groups (Karner and Marcantonio 2018). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains out of, or is only emerging in the debates surrounding the planning of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (Grant 2015; </span><span id="id21528" class="s1">IADB  2012;  Khosla  and  Bhardwaj  2019).  Finally,  from  a  political  economy  perspective,  it  is  also interesting to note that (Bergquist et al. 2020) find higher support for climate policy packages in the U.S. when affordable housing programs are included. </span></div>

<div id="id21651"><span id="id21652" class="s1">In  addition,  investment  in  infrastructure  is  critical  to  the  development  of  decarbonised  economic structures that generate growth, employment, and universal access to a wide range of services that are central to the SDG agenda: transportation, water, sanitation, electricity, flood protection, and irrigation. For low- and middle-income countries, annual costs of reaching these goals by 2030 and putting their economies on a path toward decarbonisation may range between 2 and 8 percent of GDP, with the level depending  on  spending  efficiency.  Notably,  these  costs  need  not  exceed  those  of  more  polluting alternatives  (Rozenberg and  Fay  2019).  For transportation, this  involves a  shift toward  more  public transportation (rail and bus), and decarbonised electricity for vehicles, combined with land-use policies that densify cities and reduce distances between homes and jobs. By influencing the spatial distribution of households and firms and the organisation of transportation, infrastructure has a strong bearing on GHG  emissions  and  the  costs  of  providing  services to  different  populations.  Depending  on  country context,  the  private  sector  may  play  a  particularly  important  role  in  the  financing  of  infrastructure (World Bank 2009; Klein 2015). </span></div>
<div id="id21666"><span id="id21667" class="s1">Many investments in infrastructure and sectoral capital stocks have long lifetimes. Given this, it may be important to make sure that today&#8217;s investments be fully decarbonised at the start or that they later can be converted to zero carbon. Today&#8217;s investments in electric vehicles in settings where electricity is produced with fossil fuels is an example of convertible investments&#8212;they will be decarbonised once electricity  production  has  switched  to  renewable  energies.  For  capital  stocks  that  cannot  be decarbonised, countries may face costs of decommissioning well before the end of their useful lifetimes, especially when it is needed to respect country commitments to future full decarbonisation. </span></div>

While  this  may  be  particularly challenging  in  developing  countries,  given  large  populations  still  lacking  basic  needs,  previous development paths show that finding synergies in development and climate objectives in the AFOLU sector is possible. One example is Brazil, which has arguably shifted its development pathway to reduce emissions and make progress towards several SDGs, though progress is not linear. Over the past two decades, Brazil had made remarkable progress in implementing a sequence of policies across multiple sectors.  This  policy  package  simultaneously  increased  minimum  wages  of  low  income  families, achieved universal energy access, and raised the quality of life and well-being for the large majority of the population (Da Silveira Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2018, 2017; La Rovere et al. 2018).

A  long-term  and  strategic  vision  was  important  in  guiding enabling policies and mechanisms. </span></div>
<div id="id21841"><span id="id21842" class="s1">In more recent years, some of these shifts in Brazil&#8217;s development pathways were undone. Political changes  have  redefined  development  priorities,  with  higher  priority  being  given  to  agricultural development  than  climate  change  mitigation.  The  current  administration  has  reduced  the  power  of environmental  agencies  and  forestry  protection  laws (including the  forest  code),  while  allowing the expansion of cropland to protected Amazon rainforest areas (Ferrante and Fearnside 2019; Rochedo et al. 2018). As a result, in 2020, deforestation exceeded 11,000 km</span><span id="id21848" class="s10">2</span><span id="id21849" class="s1">, and reached the highest rate in the last  12  years  (INPE  2020).  The  literature  cautions  that,  if  current  policies  and  trends  continue,  the Amazon may reach an irreversible tipping point beyond which it will be impossible to remediate lost ecosystems  and  restore  carbon  sinks  and  indigenous  people  knowledge  (Nobre  2019;  Lovejoy  and Nobre  2018;  INPE  2019a).  In  addition,  fossil  fuel  subsidies  and  other  fiscal  support  of  increased exploitation  of  oil  resources  may  create  carbon  lock-ins  that  further  inhibit  low-carbon  investments (Lef&#232;vre et al. 2018). </span></div>
<div id="id21857"><span id="id21858" class="s1">Brazil&#8217;s  progress  in  mitigation  depended  significantly  on  reduced  deforestation  in  the  past.  If deforestation rates keep on rising, mitigation efforts would need to shift to the energy sector. However, according to Rochedo et al. (2018), mitigation costs in the energy sector in Brazil are three times the costs of reducing deforestation and increasing land-based carbon sinks. Further mitigation strategies may depend on CCS in Brazil as elsewhere (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Herreras Mart&#237;nez et al. 2015), though the economic feasibility of deployment is not yet clear (4.2.5.4). </span></div>

<div id="id21870"><span id="id21871" class="s1">Mitigation actions are strongly linked to adaptation. These connections come about because mitigation actions can be adaptive (e.g., some agroforestry projects) but also through policy choices (e.g., climate finance is allocated among adaptation or mitigation projects) and even biophysical links (e.g., climate trajectories, themselves determined by mitigation, can influence the viability of adaptation projects). As development pathways shape the levers and enablers available to a society (4.3.1, Figure 4.7), a broader set of enabling conditions also helps with adaptation (</span><span id="id21877" class="s103">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span id="id21878" class="s1">). </span></div>

The Agreement explicitly recognises that mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation can  count  towards  NDC  targets.  The  IPCC  Fifth  Assessment  Report  (IPCC  2014)  emphasised  that sustainable  development  is  helpful  in  going  beyond  a  narrow  focus  on  separate  mitigation  and </span><span id="id21887" class="s1">adaptation options and their specific co-benefits. The IPCC Special Report on climate change and land addresses GHG emissions from land-based ecosystems with a focus on the vulnerability of land-based systems  to  climate  change.

Other  assessments  have  highlighted  how  ecosystem functions  can  support  sustainable  development  and  are  critical  to  meeting  the  goals  of  the  Paris Agreement (IPBES 2019b). IPCC SR15 found that sustainable development pathways to 1.5 &#176;C broadly support  and  often  enable  transformations  and  that  &#8220;sustainable  development  has  the  potential  to significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity, and promote livelihood security for  poor  and  disadvantaged  populations  (</span><span id="id22055" class="s103">high  confidence)</span><span id="id22056" class="s1">&#8221;  (IPCC  2018b:  5.3.1).

<div id="id22428"><span id="id22429" class="s1">Farming system approaches to agricultural mitigation have a wide variety of co-benefits and tradeoffs. Indeed, there are conceptual formulations for these practices in which the co-benefits are more of a focus, such as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) which ties mitigation to adaptation through its three pillars of increased productivity, mitigation, and adaptation (Lipper et al. 2014). The &#8216;4 per 1000&#8217; goal to increase soil carbon by 0.4% per year (Soussana et al. 2019) is compatible with the three pillars of CSA. Sustainable intensification, a framework which centers around a need for increased agricultural production  within  environmental  constraints  also  complements  CSA  (Campbell  et  al.  2014).  The literature reports examples of mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions, with evidence from various regions (Chapter 7, Thornton and Herrero (2015), Thornton et al. (2018)). </span></div>
<div id="id22439"><span id="id22440" class="s1">Conservation agriculture, promoted for improving agricultural soils and crop diversity (Powlson et al. 2016) can help build adaptive capacity (Smith et al. 2017; Pradhan et al. 2018a) and yield mitigation co-benefits through improved  fertiliser  use  or  efficient  use  of machinery and fossil  fuels  (Cui et al. 2018; Harvey et al. 2014; Pradhan et al. 2018a).  </span></div>
<div id="id22445"><span id="id22446" class="s1">There  is  a  complex  set  of  barriers  to  implementation  of  farming-system  approaches  for  climate mitigation  (7.6.4),  suggesting  a  need  for  deliberate  shifts  in  development  pathways  to  achieve significant progress in this sector. The link between NDCs and mitigation in the land use sector can provide impetus for such policies. For example, there are multiple agricultural mitigation options that southeast  Asian  countries  could  use  to  meet  NDCs  that  would  have  an  important  adaptive  impact (Amjath-Babu et al. 2019). </span></div>
<div id="id22453"><span id="id22454" class="s1">Some agricultural practices considered sustainable have trade-offs, and their implementation can have negative effects on adaptation or other ecosystem services. Fast-growing tree monocultures or biofuel crops may enhance carbon stocks but reduce downstream water availability and decrease availability of agricultural  land  (Windham-Myers  et  al.  2018;  Kuwae  and  Hori  2019).  In  some  dry  environments similarly, agroforestry can increase competition with crops and pastures, decreasing productivity, and reduce catchment water yield (Schrobback et al. 2011).  </span></div>

On a per-area basis, carbon stocks in coastal ecosystems can be higher than in terrestrial forests (Howard et al. 2017), with below-ground carbon storage up to 1000 tC ha</span><span id="id22614" class="s10">-1</span><span id="id22615" class="s1"> (Crooks et al. 2018; McLeod et al. 2011; Bindoff et al. 2019). Overall, coastal vegetated systems have a mitigation potential of around 0.5% of current global emissions, with an upper limit of less than 2% (Bindoff et al. 2019). </span></div>
<div id="id22619"><span id="id22620" class="s1">Restoration or protection of coastal ecosystems is an important adaptation action with multiple benefits, with  bounded  global  mitigation  benefits  (Gattuso  et  al.  2018;  Bindoff  et  al.  2019).  Such restoration/preservation reduces coastal erosion and protects from storm surges, and otherwise mitigates impacts of sea level rise and extreme weather along the coast line (Siikam&#228;ki et al. 2012; Roma&#241;ach et al. 2018; Alongi 2008). Restoration of tidal flow to coastal wetlands inhibits methane emissions which occur  in  fresh  and  brackish  water  (Kroeger  et  al.  2017)  (7.4.2.8  describes  a  more  inclusive  set  of ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands). Coastal habitat restoration projects can also provide significant social benefits in the form of job creation (through tourism and recreation opportunities), as well as ecological benefits through habitat preservation (Edwards et al. 2013; Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Sutton-Grier and Moore 2016; Kairo et al. 2018; Wylie et al. 2016; Bindoff et al. 2019).  </span></div>
<div id="id22631"><span id="id22632" class="s1">Coastal ecosystem-based mitigation can be cost-effective, but interventions should be designed with care. One concern is to assure that actions remain effective at higher levels of climate change (Alongi 2015; Bindoff et al. 2019). Also, methane emissions from ecosystems may partially reduce the benefit of the carbon sequestration (Rosentreter et al. 2018) depending on the salinity (Poffenbarger et al. 2011; Kroeger et al. 2017). As the main driver of mangrove forest loss is aquaculture/agriculture (Thomas et al. 2017), there may be entrenched interests opposing restoration and protection actions. </span></div>
<div id="id22639"><span id="id22640" class="s1096">Restoration and protection of terrestrial ecosystems</span><span id="id22643" class="s1">Restoration  of  terrestrial  landscapes  can  be  a  direct  outcome  of  development  pathways,  and  can  be critical to achieving a variety of SDGs (especially 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15) (Lapola et al. 2018; Vergara et al. 2016) although it also presents risks and can have trade-offs with other SDGs (Cao et al. 2010; Dooley and  Kartha  2018).  Landscape  restoration is  nearly always  a mitigation  action, and  can also  provide adaptive  capacity.  While  policy  in  Brazil  has  tended  to  focus  on  the  Amazon  as  a  carbon  sink,  the mitigation co-benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation actions have been highlighted in the literature (Di Gregorio et al. 2016; Locatelli et al. 2011). A study of potential restoration of degraded lands in Latin America  (Vergara  et  al.  2016)  indicates  that  substantial  benefits  for  mitigation,  adaptation,  and economic development accrue after several years, underscoring a reliance on deliberate development choices.  In  agricultural  contexts,  restoration is  a  development choice  that  can enhance  adaptive  and mitigative capacity via impact on farmer livelihoods. </span></div>

<div id="id22805"><span id="id22806" class="s1">Shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex endeavours that carry risks. Some of these risks can be easily captured by quantitative models. Others are better understood via qualitative  approaches,  such  as  qualitative  narrative  storylines  (told  in  words)  and  methods  mixing qualitative and quantitative models (Kemp-Benedict 2012; Hanger-Kopp et al. 2019). The following outline key risks and relevant hedging strategies identified in the literature. </span></div>
<div id="id22812"><span id="id22813" class="s1096">4.4.3.1</span><span id="id22815" class="s1096">Actions by others not consistent with domestic efforts </span><span id="id22817" class="s1">The international context is a major source of uncertainty for national-level planning, especially for small- or medium-sized open economies, because the outcome of domestic choices may significantly depend on decisions made by other countries and actor, over which national governments have limited or no control (Lachapelle and Paterson 2013). Availability of foreign financial resources in countries with limited domestic savings (Baum et al. 2017) and availability of technology transfers (Glachant and Dechezlepr&#234;tre 2017) are some examples. Other external decisions with significant bearing on domestic action include mitigation policies in other countries (Dai et al. 2017), and especially in major trading partners, the lack of which can result in competitive disadvantage for sectors exposed to international competition (Alton et al. 2014). The international prices of the key commodities (notably energy), goods and services are important, notably when shifting development pathway is based on structural change (e.g., Willenbockel et al. (2017) for Ghana and Kenya). </span></div>
<div id="id22829"><span id="id22830" class="s1">Remedies include first devising policy packages that are, to the extent possible, robust to uncertainty regarding  external  decisions.  For  example,  mitigation  in  the  building  sector  is  considered  less problematic  for  competitiveness  since  the  construction  sector  is  less  exposed  to  international competition. Remedies also include securing international cooperation to reduce the uncertainty that domestic decision-makers face about the international context. Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities and financing  of  transitions  (15.6),  which  can  enable  shifting  development  pathways.  Cooperation  can generate positive spill overs through technology diffusion (13.6.6). Third, cooperation is not limited to governments. As discussed in section 4.2.3, international cooperative initiatives among non-State actors (cities,  economic  branches,  etc.)  can  also  provide  know-how,  resources  and  stable  cooperative frameworks that reduce uncertainty for individual actors (14.5.5). </span></div>

Even though decisions are no longer made &#8220;in a sea of uncertainty&#8221; (Lave 1991), we know that  new  information  will  come  over  time,  that  may  have  significant  bearing  on  the  design  and objectives of policies to shift development pathways and accelerate mitigation. New information may come from climate sciences (e.g., updated GWP values or available carbon budgets) (Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018), impact sciences (e.g., re-evaluation of climate impacts associated with given emission pathways) (Ricke et  al.  2018)  or  mitigation  sciences  (e.g.,  on  availability  of  given  technologies)  (Lenzi  et  al.  2018; Giannousakis et al. 2020).  </span></div>
<div id="id22989"><span id="id22990" class="s1">At the same time, economic and social systems are characterised by high degree of inertia, via long-lived capital stock or urban forms  (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014), or more broadly mutually reinforcing physical, economic, and social constraints (Seto et al. 2016) that may lead to carbon lock-ins (Erickson et al. 2015). Risks associated with long-lasting fossil-fuel power plants have been the object of particular attention. For example, Pfeiffer et al. (2018) estimate that even if the current pipeline of power plants was cancelled, about 20% of the existing capacity might be stranded to remain compatible with 1.5&#176;C or  2&#176;C  pathways&#8212;implying  that  additional  capital  accumulation  would  lead  to  higher  sunk  costs associated with stranded assets (Luderer et al. 2018b; Johnson et al. 2015; Ansar et al. 2013; Kriegler et al. 2018). </span></div>
<div id="id23000"><span id="id23001" class="s1">In the presence of uncertainty and inertia (or irreversibilities), hedging strategies may be considered, that include selection of risk-hedging strategies and processes to adjust decisions as new information becomes available. The notion of hedging against risks is also prominent in the adaptation literature, as exemplified by the terminology of &#8220;climate resilient development&#8221; (Fankhauser and McDermott 2016) (WGII, Ch.18). There is also a growing literature on hedging strategies for individual actors (e.g., firms or investors) in the face of the uncertainties associated with mitigation (e.g., policy uncertainty or the associated carbon price uncertainty) (e.g., (Morris et al. 2018) or (Andersson et al. 2016)). On the other hand, there is often limited discussion of uncertainty and of its implication for hedging strategies in the accelerated  mitigation  pathway  literature.  Exceptions  include  (Capros  et  al.  2019),  who  elicit  &#8220;no-regret&#8221;  and  &#8220;disruptive&#8221;  mitigation  options  for  the  EU  through  a  detailed  sensitivity  analysis,  and (Watson et al. 2015) who discuss flexible strategies for the U.K. energy sector transition in the face of multiple uncertainties. </span></div>

<div id="id23103"><span id="id23104" class="s1">As noted above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation involve a broad range of stakeholders and decision-makers, at multiple geographical and temporal scales. They require a credible and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and losers and implementing compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive just transition (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). Such processes  are  designed  to  manage  the  risk  of  inequitable  or  non-representative  power  dynamics (Helsinki Design Lab 2014; Kahane 2019; Boulle et al. 2015). More generally, stakeholder processes can  be  subject  to  regulatory  capture  by  special  interests,  or  outright  opposition  from  a  variety  of stakeholders.  Information  asymmetry  between  government  and  business  may  shape  the  results  of consultative processes. Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). The next section on Just Transition (4.5) addresses this issue. </span></div>

<div id="id23122"><span id="id23123" class="s1">Equity is an ethical and at times economic imperative, but it is also instrumentally an enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated mitigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The literature supports a range of estimates of the net benefits&#8212;globally or nationally&#8212;of low-carbon transformation, and it identifies a number  of  difficulties  in  drawing  definitive  quantitative  conclusions  (e.g.,  comparisons  of  costs  &amp; benefits  among  different  actors,  the  existence  of  non-economic  impacts,  comparison  across  time, uncertainty  in  magnitude,  3.6).  One  of  the  most  important  of  these  dimensions  is  the  distributional consequences of mitigation, as well as a range of equity considerations arising from the uncertainty in net benefits, as well as from the distribution of costs and benefits among winners and losers (Rendall 2019; Caney 2016; Lahn and Bradley 2016; Lenferna 2018a; Kartha et al. 2018b; Robiou Du Pont et al.  2017).  Some  equity  approaches  are  even  just  seeking  corrective  justice  including  for  historical emissions (Adler 2007).
