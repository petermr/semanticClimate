Executive Summary 

Warming cannot be limited to well below 2°C without rapid and deep reductions in energy system 
CO2 and GHG emissions. In scenarios limiting likely warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot (likely 
below 2°C), net energy system CO2 emissions (interquartile range) fall by 87% to 97%% (60% to 79%) 
in 2050. In 2030, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net CO2 and 
GHG emissions fall by 35-51% and 38-52% respectively. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with 
no or limited overshoot (likely below 2°C), net electricity sector CO2 emissions reach zero globally 
between 2045 and 2055 (2050 and 2080) (high confidence) {6.7}  

Limiting warming to well below 2°C will require substantial energy system changes over the next 
30 years. This includes reduced fossil fuel consumption, increased production from low- and zero-
carbon  energy  sources,  and  increased  use  of  electricity  and  alternative  energy  carriers.  Coal 
consumption  without  CCS  falls  by  67%  to  82%  (interquartile  range)  in  2030  in  scenarios  limiting 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. Oil and gas consumption fall more slowly. Low-carbon 
sources produce 93% to 97% of global electricity by 2050 in scenarios that limit likely warming to 2°C 
or  below.  In  scenarios  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  (likely  below  2°C), 
electricity supplies 48% to 58% (36% to 47%) of final energy in 2050, up from 20% in 2019. (high 
confidence) {6.7} 

Net Zero energy systems will share common characteristics, but the approach in every country 
will  depend  on  national  circumstances.  Common  characteristics  of  net  zero  energy  systems  will 
include:  (1)  electricity  systems  that  produce  no  net  CO2  or  remove  CO2  from  the  atmosphere;  (2) 
widespread electrification of end uses, including light-duty transport, space heating, and cooking; (3) 
substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today (4) use of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, 
bioenergy, and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to electrification; (5) more 
efficient  use  of  energy  than  today;  (6)  greater  energy  system  integration  across  regions  and  across 
components of the energy system; and (7) use of CO2 removal (e.g., DACCS, BECCS) to offset any 
residual emissions. (high confidence) {6.6} 

Energy demands and energy sector emissions have continued to rise. From 2015 to 2019, global 
final energy consumption grew by 6.6%, CO2 emissions from the global energy system grew by 4.6%, 
and  total  GHG  emissions  from  energy  supply  rose  by  2.7%.  Methane  emissions,  mainly  fugitive 
emissions  from  oil,  gas,  and  coal,  accounted  for  18%  of  GHG  emissions  in  2019.  Coal  electricity 
capacity  grew  by  7.6%  between  2015 and  2019,  as  new  builds in  some  countries  offset  declines  in 
others. Total consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew 
by  15%.  Declining  energy  intensity  in  almost  all  regions  has  been  balanced  by  increased  energy 
consumption. (high confidence) {6.3} 

Prices  have  dropped  rapidly  over  the  last  five  years  for  several  key  energy  system  mitigation 
options, notably solar PV, wind power, and batteries. From 2015 to 2020, the prices of electricity 
from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respectively, and battery prices dropped by 64%. Electricity 
from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles 
are  increasingly  competitive  with  internal  combustion  engines,  and  large-scale  battery  storage  on 
electricity grids is increasingly viable. (high confidence) {6.3, 6.4} 

Global wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased rapidly. Solar PV grew by 170% 
(to 680 TWh); wind grew by 70% (to 1420 TWh) from 2015 to 2019. Policy, societal pressure to limit 
fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. 
Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of 
total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted 
for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for

16% (4290 TWh) of total generation. In total, low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies 
produced 37% of global electricity in 2019. (high confidence) {6.3, 6.4} 

If investments in coal and other fossil infrastructure continue, energy systems will be locked-in to 
higher emissions, making it harder to limit warming to well below 2°C. Many aspects of the energy 
system – physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behaviour – are resistant to 
change  or  take  many  years  to  change.  New  investments  in  coal-fired  electricity  without  CCS  are 
inconsistent with limiting warming to well below 2°C. (high confidence) {6.3, 6.7}  

Limiting  warming  to  well  below  2°C  will  strand  fossil-related  assets,  including  fossil 
infrastructure and unburned fossil fuel resources. The economic impacts of stranded assets could 
amount to trillions of dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets 
are  more  vulnerable  toward  mid-century.  CCS  can  allow  fossil  fuels  to  be  used  longer,  reducing 
potential stranded assets. (high confidence) {6.7} 

A  low-carbon  energy  transition  will  shift  investment  patterns  and  create  new  economic 
opportunities. Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if likely 
warming is limited to 2°C or below. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the 
reallocations of investment flows that are likely to be seen across sub-sectors, namely from fossil fuels 
(extraction, conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, nuclear power, 
CCS, electricity networks and storage, and end-use energy efficiency. A significant and growing share 
of investments between now and 2050 will be made in emerging economies, particularly in Asia. (high 
confidence) {6.7}  

Climate  change  will  affect  many  future  local  and  national  low-carbon  energy  systems.  The 
impacts,  however,  are  uncertain,  particularly  at  the  regional  scale.  Climate  change  will  alter 
hydropower  production,  bioenergy  and  agricultural  yields,  thermal  power  plant  efficiencies,  and 
demands  for  heating  and  cooling,  and  it  will  directly  impact  power  system  infrastructure.  Climate 
change will not affect wind and solar resources to the extent that it would compromise their ability to 
reduce emissions. (high confidence) {6.5} 

Electricity  systems  powered  predominantly  by  renewables will  be  increasingly  viable  over the 
coming  decades,  but  it  will  be  challenging  to  supply  the  entire  energy  system  with  renewable 
energy.  Large  shares  of  variable  solar  PV  and  wind  power  can  be  incorporated  in  electricity  grids 
through  batteries,  hydrogen,  and  other  forms  of  storage;  transmission;  flexible  non-renewable 
generation; advanced controls; and greater demand-side responses. Because some applications (e.g., air 
travel) are not currently amenable to electrification, 100% renewable energy systems would likely need 
to include alternative fuels such as hydrogen or biofuels. Economic, regulatory, social, and operational 
challenges increase with higher shares of renewable electricity and energy. The ability to overcome 
these challenges in practice is not fully understood. {high confidence} {6.6} 

Multiple energy supply options are available to reduce emissions over the next decade. Nuclear 
power and hydropower are already established technologies. Solar PV and wind are now cheaper than 
fossil-generated electricity in many locations. Bioenergy accounts for about a tenth of global primary 
energy. Carbon capture is widely used in the oil and gas industry, with early applications in electricity 
production and biofuels. It will not be possible to widely deploy all of these and other options without 
efforts to address the geophysical, environmental-ecological, economic, technological, socio-cultural, 
and institutional factors that can facilitate or hinder their implementation. (high confidence) {6.4} 

Some  mitigation  options  can  provide  more  immediate  and  cost-effective  emissions  reductions 
than  others,  but  a  comprehensive  approach  will  be  required  over  the  next  ten  years  to  limit 
warming to well below 2°C. There are substantial, cost-effective opportunities to reduce emissions 
rapidly in several sectors, including electricity generation and light-duty transportation. But near-term 
reductions in these sectors will not be sufficient to limit warming to well below 2°C. A broad-based

approach across the energy sector will be necessary to reduce emissions over the next ten years and to 
set the stage for still deeper reductions beyond 2030. (high confidence) {6.4, 6.6, 6.7} 

Enhanced integration across energy system sectors and across scales will lower costs and facilitate 
low-carbon energy system transitions. Greater integration between the electricity sector and end use 
sectors can facilitate integration of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) options. Energy systems can be 
integrated across district, regional, national, and international scales. (high confidence) {6.4, 6.6} 

The viable speed and scope of a low-carbon energy system transition will depend on how well it 
can support sustainable development goals (SDGs) and other societal objectives. Energy systems 
are linked to a range of societal objectives, including energy access, air and water pollution, health, 
energy  security,  water  security,  food  security,  economic  prosperity,  international  competitiveness, 
employment. These linkages and their importance vary among regions. Energy sector mitigation and 
efforts  to  achieve  SDGs  generally  support  one  another,  though  there  are  important  region-specific 
exceptions. (high confidence) {6.1, 6.7} 

The economic outcomes of low-carbon transitions in some sectors and regions may be on par with, 
or  superior  to  those  of  an  emissions-intensive  future.  Cost  reductions  in  key  technologies, 
particularly in electricity and light-duty transport, have increased the economic attractiveness of near-
term low-carbon transitions. Long-term mitigation costs are not well understood and depend on policy 
design  and  implementation,  and  the  future  costs  and  availability  of  technologies.  Advances  in  low-
carbon  energy  resources  and  carriers  such  as  next-generation  biofuels,  hydrogen  produced  from 
electrolysis, synthetic fuels, and carbon-neutral ammonia would substantially improve the economics 
of net zero energy systems. (medium confidence) {6.4, 6.7}

6.1  Introduction 

The global energy system is the largest source of CO2 emissions (Chapter 2). Reducing energy sector 
emissions is therefore essential to limit warming. The energy systems of the future will be very different 
from  those  of  today  if  the  world  successfully  limits  warming  to  well  below  2°C.  Energy  will  be 
provided, converted, and used in different ways than it is today (Figure 6.1). Achieving and responding 
to these changes presents an impressive range of challenges and opportunities.

Within this context, this chapter has two main objectives. First, it aims to assess specific, individual 
mitigation options in energy supply, energy transformation, and energy transportation and transmission. 
This assessment is complementary to a set of chapters that explore mitigation options in agriculture, 
forestry, and other land uses (Chapter 7), urban systems and other settlements (Chapter 8), buildings 
(Chapter 9), transport (Chapter 10), industry (Chapter 11), and cross-sectoral perspectives (Chapter 12). 
Second,  this  chapter  aims  to  assess  system-level  mitigation  opportunities  and  challenges  across  the 
entirety of energy systems. These systems include energy supply, transformation, transmission, storage, 
transportation,  and  end-uses.  They  also  include  the  societal  systems  that  interact  with  the  physical 
energy system. As energy systems become increasingly integrated and interconnected, a system-wide 
perspective is necessary for understanding mitigation opportunities and challenges.  

Within this context, this chapter addresses six topics, each of which is addressed in a separate section. 
First, Section 6.2 defines the scope of the energy system. Section 6.3 then discusses the recent trends in 
energy systems that might exert the most significant influence on energy system evolution and options 
for  reducing  emissions.  Section  6.4  assesses  the  status  and  potential  of  individual  energy  supply, 
transformation,  storage,  transportation  and  transmission,  and  integration  mitigation  options  in  the 
energy sector. Section 6.5 explores how climate change might affect energy systems and alter potential 
energy system mitigation options and strategies. Section 6.6 identifies key characteristics of net zero 
energy systems – those that emit very little or no CO2. Section 6.7 explores transition pathways toward 
and through net zero energy systems. Across all of these sections, the chapter aims to explore the ways 
that  energy  sector  mitigation  options  and  strategies  interact  with  SDGs  and  other  societal  and 
environmental goals.

6.2  The Scope of the Energy System and its Possible Evolution 

For this chapter, energy systems are defined broadly to include both physical and societal elements. The 
physical  infrastructure  includes  all  the  infrastructure  and  equipment  used  to  extract,  transform, 
transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a 
broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use 
energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their 
homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the 
systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the 
operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can 
adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use 
energy.  Consumers  can  invest in  equipment  that  reduces  their  energy  needs,  and  they  can  invest  in 
technologies  that  transform  energy  (e.g.,  rooftop  solar)  or  store  energy  (e.g.,  batteries).  Firms  and 
governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy  such as power plants, 
refineries, electric transmission lines, and oil tankers. All aspects of energy systems are governed by 
laws, regulations, and actual institutions that reside within businesses and governments at all levels. 
This includes,  for example,  rules for  trading emissions  permits,  deciding  when  particular electricity 
generation technologies might come  online, water management and related environmental rules that 
define  the  availability  of  hydropower  or  influence  water  availability  for  cooling  power  plants, 
regulations  for  injecting  CO2  into  underground  reservoirs  or  disposing  of  nuclear  waste,  and  even 
company  policies  regarding  work  hours  or  teleworking,  which  can  have  important  implications  for 
energy demand profiles. Many people are employed in the energy sector, and energy system mitigation 
will eliminate some jobs while creating others.  

This broader view of energy systems is essential for understanding energy system mitigation, as these 
broader  societal  and  institutional  factors  can  have  an  important  influence  on  energy  system 
transformations and the potential to rapidly reduce energy CO2 emissions. Energy system mitigation is 
as much about the challenges of societal change as it is about the challenges of changes in physical 
infrastructure,  technologies,  and  operations.  While  this  chapter  does  not  attempt  to  draw  a  specific 
boundary around all the different systems that interact with the energy system, it frequently explores 
these broader system interactions when assessing different mitigation options and strategies. 

There is no single spatial scale at which energy systems might be defined and assessed. They can be 
assessed at the scales of homes, cities, states or provinces, countries, regions, or the entire world. These 
different scales are frequently both distinct with their own internal dynamics yet also connected to one 
another. This chapter most frequently assesses energy systems from the country and global perspective.  

Because the energy system is so complex, it can be hard to define particular parts of it precisely, and 
there may be competing definitions in the literature. For the purposes of this chapter, “energy supply” 
encompasses all primary energy, conversion, and transmission processes with the exception of those 
that use final energy to provide energy services in the end-use sectors (transport, buildings, industry 
and  agriculture).  The  “energy  system”  includes  energy  end  uses  sectors  along  with  energy  supply. 
“Low-emissions” is used for energy technologies that produce little CO2 or no CO2 or that remove CO2 
from the atmosphere. Similarly, “low-carbon” transitions is used to describe transitions that limit likely 
warming to 2°C or below. “Net-zero” energy systems refer to those that produce very little or no CO2 
or may even sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.

6.3  Recent Energy System Trends and Developments  

Global energy sector emissions continue to grow but at a decreasing rate 

Current energy sector emissions trends, if continued, will not limit global temperature change to well 
below 2°C (high confidence). Global energy system fossil fuel CO2 emissions grew by 4.6% between 
2015  and  2019  (1.1%  yr-1),  reaching  38  GtCO2  yr-1  and  accounting  for  approximately  two-thirds  of 
annual global anthropogenic GHG emissions. In 2020, with the worldwide COVID pandemic, energy 
sector CO2 emissions dropped by roughly 2 GtCO2 yr-1 (Figure 6.2). However global energy-related 
CO2 emissions are projected to rebound by nearly 5% in 2021, approaching the 2018-19 peak (IEA 
2021d) 

Figure 6.2 Global energy sector fossil fuel CO2 emissions and annual change 2000-2019 (MtCO2 yr-1). 
(Source:  adapted from (Minx et al. 2021a; Crippa et al. 2021)  

Coal  was  the  single  largest  contributor  to  energy  sector  CO2  emissions  between  2015  and  2019, 
accounting for about 44% of energy sector CO2 emissions in 2019. Oil accounted for about 34% and 
natural gas accounted for about 22% of energy sector CO2 emissions. Coal, oil and natural gas CO2 
emissions grew respectively by 1.2%, 2% and 12.7% (annual rates of 0.31%, 0.5% and 3%) (Figure 
6.3). The electricity sector remains the single largest source of energy sector CO2 emissions, accounting 
for about 36% in 2019, followed by industry at 22% and transport (excluding international shipping and 
aviation transport) at about 18% (Figure  6.3). Shipping and aviation accounted for a  little over 3%. 
These proportions have remained relatively unchanged over the last decade. Recent trends reinforce the 
near-term  challenges  facing  energy  sector  mitigation  -  electricity  sector  emissions  continue  to  rise 
despite rapid deployment of wind and solar power (see below); transportation emissions continue to 
rise,  and  petroleum  remains  the  dominant  fuel,  despite  advances  in  batteries  and  electric  cars  (see 
below). Some specific sectors, such as shipping and aviation, may present longer-term challenges. 

Energy supply GHG emissions, including CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gases, reached 20 GtCO2-eq 
yr-1 in 2019, rising by 2.7% between 2015 and 2019 (0.66% yr-1). Approximately 18% of energy supply 
emissions were non-CO2 emissions. Electricity and heat contributed approximately 69% of total energy 
supply GHG emissions in 2019 (Figure 6.3). This growth has occurred despite the high penetration of 
solar PV and wind power, particularly in Asia and developed countries.  

Fugitive emissions from fossil fuel production, primarily methane, accounted for about 18% of sector 
supply emissions in 2019, with 2.6 Gt CO2eq yr-1 linked to oil and gas production and 1.3 Gt CO2eq yr-

1 to coal mining (Crippa et al. 2021). Oil and gas operations produced 2.9 GtCO2eq yr-1 in 2019 (82 Mt 
yr-1 as methane), split roughly equally between the two (IEA 2020a). There remains a high degree of 
uncertainty in methane emissions estimates from oil and gas operations despite the emergence of new 
data from satellites and other measurement campaigns. According to a recent study (Hmiel et al. 2020), 
methane emissions are underestimated by about 25 to 40%.

Figure 6.3 Global energy sector CO2 emissions and global energy supply GHG emission. Panel a: (IEA 
2020a), other panels (Crippa et al. 2021) 

Increasing global energy sector  GHG emissions have been driven by rising emissions in some large 
developing and emerging countries; however, per capita emissions in these countries remain well below 
those in developed countries (Yu et al. 2019). From 2015 to 2019, Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and 
South-East Asia energy sector CO2 emissions grew by 2.4% yr-1, 2.6% yr-1, and 5.1% yr-1, respectively. 
The relative and absolute shares of Europe and North America have continued to decline, partly due to 
the growth in other countries (Figure 6.3).

Figure 6.4 Drivers of greenhouse gas emissions across selected regions (Lamb et al. 2021).   

Despite the declining energy intensity, global energy system CO2 emissions have closely tracked GDP 
per capita (Figure 6.4). This is especially true in the Asian economies, which have experienced rapid 
GDP per capita growth in the past decades and a massive rise in energy demand. Similarly, emissions 
have declined in times of economic downturns – for example, in Eurasia in the 1990s and globally in 
2009  and  2020.  Population  growth  has  also  contributed  to  emissions  growth  globally  and  in  most 
regions, particularly Africa, but the effect of population growth has been less than that of economic 
growth. Since 2015, energy intensity has been declining (IEA 2020b), limiting the impact of economic 
and population growth. However, there is no region where this factor alone would have been sufficient 
to decrease CO2 emissions from the energy system. In Europe and North America, the only two regions 
where emissions decreased meaningfully since 2010, a steady decrease in the carbon intensity of energy 
was a significant downward driver. The reduction in carbon intensity in the EU is due primarily to the 
increase of renewable electricity production coupled with the low levels of fossil fuel-based production 
in the energy mix (Dyrstad et al. 2019).

Recent changes in the energy system can be viewed within the context of longer-term trends in energy 
supply and use. Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the total primary energy 
supply (TPES) and major changes in energy sources. From 2015 to 2019, TPES grew by 6.6% (1.6% 
yr-1) from 569 EJ yr-1 to 606 EJ yr-1. Natural gas consumption grew most quickly during this period, at 
3.5% yr-1. Coal, oil and oil products grew at annual rates of 0.23% yr-1 and 0.83% yr-1, respectively. In 
2019, the shares of coal, oil, and natural gas in global TPES were 27%, 31% and 23%, representing 
only a modest shift from 2015, when the shares were 28%, 32% and 22%, respectively. Renewables, 
excluding  hydropower,  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  12%  yr-1  during  this  period;  however,  their  share 
remains marginal in 2019 with just 2.2% of the TPES compared to 1.5% in 2015 (Figure 6.5). Bioenergy 
(including traditional bioenergy) accounted for 9.4% of the TPES, a similar share compared with 2015. 

The total final energy consumption (TFC) grew by 6.6% (1.6% yr-1) from 2015 to 2019, rising from 
392 EJ yr-1 to 418 EJ yr-1. This is a slower growth rate than the previous decade (2.8 % yr-1) (Figure 
6.5). In 2019, oil products used for transportation accounted for 41% of TFC. The penetration of non-
fossil fuels is still marginal despite the significant growth of electric vehicles in recent years. Coal still 
accounted for 9.5% of TFC in 2019, dropping from 11.7% in 2015. Coal is mainly used as a primary 
energy  source  in  industry  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  the  residential  sector.  The  share  of  electricity 
increased modestly, from 18.6% in 2015 to 20.2% in 2019, reflecting increasing access in developing 
countries and increasing use of electricity for a wide variety of end uses in the residential sector (see 
Box  6.1).  Heat  accounts for  approximately  3%  of  TFC,  used  mainly  in  industry  and  the  residential 
sector. Biofuels and waste accounted for 10.4% of TFC in 2019, only modestly changed compared with 
2015. 

Figure 6.5 World Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) (EJ) and total final energy consumption (TFC) 
2000-2019 (adapted from IEA world energy balances (Minx et al. 2021b)database for IPCC) 

There  are  important  differences  in  fuel  use  across  countries.  While  developed  countries  almost 
exclusively use modern fuels, many countries still obtain a significant fraction of their energy from 
traditional  bioenergy  (fuelwood  and  charcoal).  Traditional  bioenergy  (fuelwood  and  charcoal)  is 
particularly important in sub-Saharan countries and some Asian countries such as India, particularly in 
the residential sector for cooking. Africa is still characterized by a high share of traditional bioenergy 
in TPES and TFC. In 2019, biomass and waste in Africa accounted for 44% of the TPES. The global 
average was 9.4%. 

Asia has been particularly important in TFC growth since 2015. In 2019, Eastern Asia accounted for 
more 24% of TFC (1.52% annual growth from 2015). In contrast, TFC has increased by only 0.58% in 
Europe and 1.24% in North America. Despite an increase of 2.05% over the same period, Africa’s TFC 
remains relatively low (6.1% of global TFC), particularly in sub-Saharan countries. Approximately 860 
million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and some Asian countries, lacked access to electricity and

about 2.65 billion to clean-cooking facilities in 2018 (IEA 2019a). Achieving universal energy access 
(SDG-7) will require energy transitions in the domestic sector, including new developments in off-grid 
energy  technologies,  emphasis  on  rationalizing  energy  subsidies,  and  increasing  efforts  to  address 
health concerns related to the use of traditional fuels (Box 6.1). 

Non-climate factors continue to drive energy systems changes 
While energy system changes are vital to climate mitigation, recent energy system changes have arisen 
in response to a much broader set of factors. Important factors include economic growth, energy access, 
energy  justice,  energy  security,  air  pollution,  technological  progress  in  low-emissions  technologies, 
local job creation. Several of these are discussed here. 

Energy  Access.  Between  2000  and  2019,  the  proportion  of  the  population  with access  to  electricity 
increased from 73% to 90% (IEA 2020c). Although most of those people gaining access to energy have 
gained access to fossil fuel-based electricity, an increasing number are gaining access to electricity from 
renewable sources. Low-emissions, decentralised systems are proving a cost-effective way to provide 
electricity in rural areas (Scott et al. 2016; IEA 2019b; Muchunku et al. 2018), although the use of diesel 
generators continues in some remote areas. Between 2000 and 2019 the proportion of the population 
with access to clean cooking (modern fuels and/or improved biomass cookstoves) rose from 52% to 
66%. 

Energy Security. The ability of countries to maintain access to reliable and affordable energy resources 
continues to shape energy policy. Energy security is perceived as a national security issue and often 
prioritized over climate concerns (Nyman 2018). The linkage between climate and energy security is 
now widely recognized (Toke and Vezirgiannidou 2013, Fu et al. 2021; La Viña et al. 2018; Blarke and 
Lund  2007;  World  Energy  Council  2020;  United  Nations  2021).  Approaches  to  energy  security are 
frequently driven by the scope of domestic energy resources. For example, energy security concerns 
have led to continued reliance on domestic coal production and consumption  (Jakob et al. 2020) and 
increased  investment  in  domestic  renewable  generation  (Konstantinos  &amp;  Ioannidis,  2017).  LNG 
Importers have diversified their sources as reliance on LNG has increased (Vivoda 2019). 

Air Pollution. The energy system is an important source of air pollution, including both indoor and 
outdoor air pollution. Efforts to address air pollution in several countries and regions (the U. S., Mexico, 
China, India, European Union, Africa, Southeast Asia, among others) have had an importance influence 
on energy system changes (Bollen and Brink 2014, Fang et al. 2019). Policies aimed at controlling NOX 
and SO2 emissions have driven emissions abatement efforts and coal fleet retirements (Drake &amp; York, 
2021) (Singh and Rao 2015). In some places, the prospect of reducing local air pollution remains more 
salient to policymakers and the public than climate mitigation when deciding to tighten regulations on 
coal use (Brauers &amp; Oei, 2020). 

Technology  and  costs.  Costs  for  renewable  technologies  have  fallen  significantly  in  recent  years, 
driving significant changes in electricity production and transportation (see below). These advances are 
not  divorced  from  climate  and  other  environmental  concerns  (Kuik,  Branger,  &amp;  Quirion,  2019; 
Timilsina &amp; Shah, 2020). Recent advances in PV cells, for example, can be traced in part to aggressive 
deployment policies spurred by energy security, climate, and other environmental concerns (Kreuz and 
Müsgens  2017,  6.3.5,  6.4.2).  The  falling  costs  of  batteries,  manly  Li-ion  batteries,  has  boosted  the 
competitiveness of electric vehicles (6.3.7.  Nykvist et al. 2015).

Successful  mitigation  must  work  in  tandem  with  fundamental  development  goals  such  as  access  to 
modern forms of energy. In many developing countries, access to electricity, clean cooking fuels, and 
modern and efficient energy remain an essential societal priority. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan 
Africa and several Asian countries. SDG7 on universal access to modern energy includes targets on 
modern  energy  services,  renewable  energy,  and  energy  efficiency,  which  implies  a  profound 
transformation of the current energy systems. Although there are different definitions of energy access, 
the ultimate goal is universal access to clean and modern fuels.

 BOX 6.1 Figure 1 Measuring access to energy (ESMAP-World Bank, 2015) 

Despite  progress  in  some countries  such  as  India,  Bangladesh  and  Kenya,  860  million  people  were 
without access to electricity in 2018, compared with 1.2 billion in 2010. About 2.65 billion households 
were cooking with solid fuels, distributed across Asia and Africa (IEA et al. 2020). Around 850 million 
people in sub-Saharan Africa relied on traditional biomass (firewood and charcoal) for cooking, and 60 
million relied on kerosene and coal to meet their energy needs (IEA 2018a). Air pollution was likely 
responsible for 1.1 million deaths across Africa in 2019 (Fisher et al. 2021). It has been estimated that 
2.2 billion people will still be dependent on inefficient and polluting energy sources for cooking by 
2030,  mainly  in  Asia  and Sub-Saharan  Africa, and  650  million  people  are  likely  to  remain  without 
access to electricity in 2030, 90% of whom will reside in Sub-Saharan Africa (IEA et al. 2020). 

Research indicates that decentralised and on-grid renewables are likely the least cost options to provide 
universal  access  to  electricity  by  2030  (Section  6.4.2).  Natural  gas,  LPG,  and  improved  biomass 
cookstoves are the most important options for cooking. Universal access to electricity and clean cooking 
requires a rapid shift from traditional biomass to cleaner fuels and/or clean cooking technologies (IEA 
et al. 2020). It has been estimated that the provision of electricity and clean cooking for all would require 
USD 786 billion in cumulative investment to 2030, equal to 3.4% of total energy sector investment over 
the period (IEA 2017). 

Even  without  universal  access  to  modern  energy,  increased  access  will  substantially  affect  energy 
systems,  particularly  electricity  systems  through  the  deployment  of  renewable  energy,  LPG,  and 
biomass supply chains. Universal access for households, however, will have a minimal impact on global 
energy demand; it has been estimated that universal access for household will increase energy demand 
by 0.2% in 2030 (37 Mtoe yr-1) relative to a future without any change in access to modern energy 
(citation)

Global  coal  consumption  has  been  declining,  with  small  fluctuations,  since  it  peaked  in  2013  (IEA 
2020d). Coal is faring differently across regions. Coal use has been decreasing in the OECD regions, 
particularly in the U.S. and the European Union, while remaining mostly flat in China after a period of 
growth, and it is continuing to increase in other major developing Asian economies (IEA 2020d). Trends 
in the electricity sector, where most coal is being consumed, are similar. Growth in coal-fired electricity 
generation  capacity  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region  has  offset  retirements  in  North  America  and  Europe 
(Jakob et al. 2020).  

Reductions in coal consumption have been driven in large part by non-climate factors, most notably 
environmental  regulations to  address  air pollution,  rapidly  declining costs of  renewables, and  lower 
natural  gas  prices,  especially  inexpensive  unconventional  gas  in  the  U.S.  (Diluiso  et  al  2021; 
Vinichenko et al., 2021; Culver and Hong 2016). Older coal-fired power plants that cannot meet new 
environmental regulations or have become unprofitable or uncompetitive have been closed in many 
regions. Moreover, coal power expansion has slowed down in Asia, as countries have suspended and 
cancelled  new  projects  for  reasons  such  as  overcapacity,  environmental  constraints,  and  the 
development of renewables (see Box 6.2).  

Different regions have replaced retired coal with different energy sources. Old coal fleets have been 
replaced approximately half by gas and half by renewables in the U.S., mainly by renewables in the 
European Union, and by advanced coal plants and renewables in Asia (EMBER 2020). Replacing old 
coal with new coal facilities is inconsistent with limiting warming to 2ºC or below {high confidence} 
(Pfeiffer et al. 2016, 2018; Smith et al. 2019; Tong et al. 2019, Section 6.7.4). 

Major coal consuming countries with abundant coal reserves remain far from phasing out coal (Spencer 
et al. 2018; Edenhofer et al. 2018). In most developing countries with large coal reserves, coal use has 
been  increasing  to  support  energy  security  and  because  it  is  perceived  to  have  lower  costs  than 
alternatives (Steckel et al. 2015; Kalkuhl et al 2019). However, coal faces increasing business risks 
from  the  decreasing  costs  of  alternative,  low-emissions  energy  sources  and  increasing  focus  on  air 
pollution and other environmental impacts from coal mining and use (Garg et al. 2017; Sovacool et al 
2021). Continued coal builds, mostly in developing countries, will increase the risks of stranded assets 
(see Box 6.13) (Farfan Orozco 2017; Saygin et al. 2019; Cui et al. 2019). 

Economic, social, and employment impacts of accelerated coal phaseouts tend to be significant in coal-
dependent regions. Tailored reemployment has been used to support coal transitions in some regions. 
Although  some  estimates  show  higher  employment  opportunities  from  low-carbon  energy  (Garrett-
Peltier 2017), results vary across regions. Moreover, even with a net increase in total employment, in 
the long run, renewable jobs are often located outside of coal regions and require different skill sets 
from  the  coal  industry  (Spencer  et  al.  2018).  In  a  broader  sense,  achieving  a  “just  transition”  also 
requires managing the impacts on regional economic development for coal-dependent communities and 
the  effects  of  higher  energy  prices  for  consumers  and  energy-intensive  industries  through  a 
comprehensive policy package (see Box6.2) (Jakob et al. 2020; Green and Gambhir 2020).

Box  6.2 Status and Challenges of a Coal Phase-Out 

Limiting global warming to 2ºC or below requires a rapid shift away from unabated coal consumption 
(coal without CCS) in the energy system by 2050 (IPCC 2018a Section 6.7, Chapter 3). This will require 
cancellation of new coal power projects and accelerated retirement of existing coal plants (Pfeiffer et 
al.  2018;  Edenhofer  et  al.  2018;  Tong  et  al.  2019,  Kriegler  et  al.  2018Smith  et  al.  2019).  To  limit 
warming to 2ºC or below, and without new builds, existing coal plants will need to retire 10 to 25 years 
earlier than the historical average operating lifetime. Completing all planned projects will further reduce 
the viable lifetime of all plants by 5 to 10 years if warming is to be limited to 2ºC or below (Cui et al.

2019). Phasing-out coal in the next few decades will present economic, social, and security challenges. 
These will vary across regions based on the characteristics of existing coal infrastructure, the availability 
of alternatives, economic development, and technological and institutional lock-in (Jakob et al. 2020).

Historical facility age at retirement (b) the vintage year of existing units, (c) global coal capacity under 
different plant lifetimes, compared to capacity levels consistent with a well-below 2°C (green) and 1.5°C 
(blue) pathway assuming no new coal plants, and (d) and assuming plants currently under construction 
come online as scheduled, but those in planning or permitting stages are not built. (Source: (Cui et al. 
2019)).  

Between 2015 and 2019, global coal power capacity grew by 146 GW, or 7.6%, as new builds offset 
retirements in some countries (Global Energy Monitor et al. 2021). Meanwhile, an increasing number 
of countries and regions have committed to or operationalised coal phase-outs (Jewell et al. 2019; Watts 
et  al. 2019;  Littlecott et al.  2021).  Actions  are being taken  by various  international and subnational 
actors,  including  national  and  subnational  governments,  public  and  private  power  companies,  and 
financial  institutions  and  pension  funds  that  have  committed  not  to  fund  new  coal  or  coal-based 
infrastructure (yan Nie et al. 2016; Buckley 2019; Auger et al. 2021). Although these initial efforts are 
not yet sufficient in limiting warming to 1.5°C, and most have occurred in regions with older coal fleets, 
these examples provide insight into possible coal phaseout strategies  (Spencer et al. 2018) and help 
identify the mechanisms driving the move away from coal, such as market, technology, policy, or other 
societal objectives. They also enable better understanding of the possible character of oil and gas phase-
downs that would ultimately be needed to limit warming two well below 2°C (Section 6.7.4; (Raimi et 
al. 2019).  

Europe: Several European countries are part of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) and have 
committed to phase-out unabated coal on or before 2030 (Jewell et al. 2019). Because these countries 
represent a small share of global coal generation capacity and have mostly ageing coal plants, they tend

to face fewer changes in phasing out coal. The effectiveness of PPCA in countries with younger coal 
fleets has thus been questioned (Jewell et al. 2019; Blondeel et al. 2020). Germany recently joined the 
PPCA and has committed to phaseout unabated coal by 2038. As part of its commitment to phase out 
coal, Germany is implementing a set of measures that include compensation for power plant closures, 
labour market measures for coal workers, and substantial support of structural change in coal-mining 
regions. Poland, another coal-heavy country in Europe, has not indicated a coal phaseout target and 
faces substantial challenges (Whitley et al. 2017; Antosiewicz et al. 2020). European efforts to phase 
out  coal  indicate  that  appropriate  financial  instruments  are  needed  (Rentier  et  al.  2019),  and  a  just 
transition for workers are important to gain broad public support and help those most affected by the 
phaseout (Johnstone and Hielscher 2017; Osička et al. 2020).  

North America: Coal use has been declining in North America. In the U.S., the primary driver has 
been the availability of cheap shale gas and ageing coal fleets. Coal use in the US has dropped by over 
50% since 2008 (EIA 2019). The recently announced NDC by the Biden Administration sets a 100% 
carbon-free  electricity  goal  by  2035  (The  White  House  2021),  indicating  a  phaseout  not  only  of 
unabated coal electricity generation, but also of natural gas generation. As one of the two founding 
countries  of  the  PPCA,  Canada  has  committed  to  phasing  out  unabated  coal  power  by  2030 
(Government of Canada 2018). Declining coal use in both the U.S. and Canada has decreased GHG 
emissions, local air pollutants, and cooling water use (Harris et al. 2015; Kondash et al. 2019). However, 
there have been concerns about social and economic consequences, particularly at the local level. For 
instance, the U.S. has lost about 50,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2021 (U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, 2021), with significant regional and economic inequities (Bodenhamer 2016; Abraham 2017; 
Greenberg  2018).  Comprehensive  social  programs,  such  as  retirement  compensation,  training  for 
reemployment, and business support for economic diversification, have been suggested as means to 
support a just transition (Patrizio et al. 2018; Homagain et al. 2015; Grubert 2020). 

Asia: After a period of rapid growth, coal expansion has slowed in Asia, but it still the primary driver 
of the global increase in coal demand (IEA 2020e). China's coal consumption reached a plateau under 
policy efforts during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), and new coal plants are being built at a slower 
rate than previously. Both China and India have suspended and cancelled many new coal power projects 
and retired a small set of old, dirty, inefficient coal plants (Global Energy Monitor et al. 2021; CEA 
2019). These efforts are largely due to non-climate reasons, such air pollution and health (Singh and 
Rao 2015; Gass et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2018; Malik et al. 2020), overcapacity (Blondeel and Van de 
Graaf 2018), and rural electrification and renewable investments (Aklin et al. 2017; Thapar et al. 2018). 
However,  as  new  builds  offset  retirements,  coal  generation  capacity  has  continued  to  grow  in  both 
countries  since  2015  (Global  Energy  Monitor  et  al.  2021).  Other  fast-growing  Southeast  Asian 
countries, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Philippines have experienced strong growth in coal use (IEA 
2020b), but an increasing number of new coal power projects are being cancelled (Littlecott et al. 2021). 
Coal projects in these countries are decreasingly likely to proceed because they rely on international 
financing, and China, Japan, United States, and other G7 countries have pledged to end overseas coal 
financing (Schiermeier 2021). 

Africa: New coal power projects in Africa have been declining since 2016, with only South Africa and 
Zimbabwe currently building new coal plants and several others has planned projects (Littlecott et al. 
2021). However, these projects also largely depend on international financing and are thus less likely 
to be implemented (see above). In South Africa, employment in the coal mining sector has dropped by 
almost half since the 1980s and is has been estimated to fall from 77,00 today to 22,000 to 42,000 by 
2050 (Strambo et al. 2019; Cock 2019). Policy and financial support are essential to ensure a sustainable 
transition for these workers (Swilling et al. 2016).

Solar and wind energy have grown dramatically, but global shares remain low relative to other 
sources 

Global PV and wind electric capacities grew 170% and 70%, respectively, between 2015 and 2019. 
Total solar and wind capacities in 2019 were 609 GW and 623 GW (Figure 6.6) and generation was 
680 TWh yr-1 and 1420 TWh yr-1. The combined share of solar and wind in the total global electricity 
generation in 2019 was around 8% (5.5% wind, 2.5% solar), up from around 5% in 2015  (IEA 2021a). 
Since 2015, the cost of solar PVs has declined by over 60%. Offshore wind costs have fallen by 32%, 
and onshore wind costs have fallen by 23% (Section 6.4). PV was around 99% of total solar capacity in 
2019;  onshore  wind  was  about  95%  of  total  wind  capacity.  Concentrating  solar  power  (CSP) 
deployment has also continued to grow, but it remains far below PV. Prior to 2010, 50% of all wind 
capacity was in Europe, but, since then, capacity growth in Asia, led by China, has surpassed the growth 
in Europe. As a consequence, Europe’s share in global solar capacity has declined from 74% in 2010 
to 24% in 2019. Asia’s share in wind and solar capacity in 2019 was 41% and 56%, followed by Europe 
(31% and 24%) and North America (20% and 12%) (IRENA 2021a, 2020a). 

Figure 6.6 Global solar and wind electricity installed capacities (GW) from 2015–2019 and their 
combined share in total electricity generation Source: data from (IEA 2021a) IRENA, 2021). 

Although  the  shares  of  wind  and  solar  remains  low  in  the  global total  electricity  generation,  recent 
growth rates signal the potential for these technologies to support substantial mitigation. The prospects 
for  a  continuation  of  recent  growth  rates  will  depend  on  meeting  key  challenges  such  as  rapidly 
integrating wind and solar into electricity grids (Section 6.6.2, Box 6.8) and retiring fossil power plants 
(see above). 

Low-carbon energy sources beyond wind and solar have continued to grow 

Low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, marine, and fossil or 
bioenergy  with  CCUS  have  continued  to  grow  since  2015  (IEA,  2017;  IEA,  2021a).  Hydroelectric 
power grew from 3890 TWh yr-1 (14.0 EJ yr-1) in 2015 to 4290 TWh yr-1 (15.5 EJ yr-1) in 2019, or 
10.3%; nuclear power grew from 2570 TWh yr-1 (9.3 EJ yr-1) to 2790 TWh yr-1 (10.1 EJ yr-1), or 8.6%. 
Hydroelectric and nuclear shares in global total electricity generation remained around 16% and 10%, 
respectively (IEA, 2017; IEA 2021a). Global biofuels production grew from 3.2 EJ yr-1 to 4.0 EJ yr-1 
from 2015 to 2019 (IEA, 2017; IEA 2021a). Bioenergy accounted for 2.4% of electricity generation in 
2019. Geothermal energy sources produced 92 TWh yr-1 (0.33 EJ yr-1) of electricity in 2019, up from 
80 TWh yr-1 (0.28 EJ yr-1) in 2015 (IEA, 2017; IEA 2021a). At present, there are 28 commercially

operating CCUS facilities with a CO2 removal capacity of around 40 million tonnes yr-1 (Mtpa). Only 
two of these are associated with electricity production; the majority are in industrial applications. 37 
commercial  projects,  accounting  for  about  75  Mtpa,  are  in  various  stages  of  development  and 
construction  (Global  CCS  Institute  2020).  The  share  of  marine  energy  in  the  global  electricity 
generation  has  remained  at  approximately  1  TWh  yr-1  since  2015.  In  total,  low-  and  zero-carbon 
electricity generation technologies produced 37% of global electricity in 2019. 

Battery prices have dropped substantially, spurring deployment in electricity and transportation 

Recent years have seen a rapid decline in the cost of energy storage, particularly batteries (see Section 
6.4.4). The price of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has declined by 97% in the past three decades and by 
90% in the past decade alone  (IEA 2021a; Ziegler and Trancik 2021)These declines have important 
implications  for  the  energy  systems,  most  notably  in  supporting  increased  deployment  of  variable 
renewable electricity (VRE) generation and electrification of the vehicle fleet.  

Battery  electricity  storage  has  emerged  as  an  important  for  supporting  the  flexibility  of  electricity 
systems as they accommodate rising shares of VRE. Although pumped-storage hydropower systems 
accounted for 160 GW,  or over 90%, of total energy storage capacity in 2019  (IEA 2020c), battery 
energy  storage  systems,  led  by  Li-ion  technology,  have  accounted  for  over  90%  of  new  capacity 
addition  since  2015  (IRENA  2019a).  In  2019,  10  GW  of  batteries  were  connected  at  the  grid  and 
consumer level, rising from 0.6 GW in 2015 (IEA 2020c; IEA WEO 2019).   

In California, in the U.S., legislation was passed to procure around 1.3 GW energy storage (excluding 
pumped storage) by 2020. One of the largest utility-scale battery storage facilities (300 MW) recently 
went online in California (Vistra Corp. 2021). Other major projects are in Florida in the US (409 MW), 
London  in  the  UK  (320  MW),  Lithuania  (200  MW),  Australia  (150  MW),  Chile  (112  MW)  and 
Germany (90 MW), (Katz 2020; ARENA 2020; IRENA 2019a).  

The drop in battery prices has also had important implications in the transportation sector. Automotive 
LIB production rose from around 40 GWh in 2015 to 160 GWh in 2020 (32%). The stock of battery 
electric vehicles (BEVs) grew from around 0.7 million in 2015 to 4.8 million in 2019 (IEA 2020d). The 
number of publicly accessible vehicle chargers reached 1.3 million in 2020, 30% of which were fast 
chargers. The average battery size of BEVs reached 67 kWh in 2019 due to consumer preferences and 
government incentives for long-range vehicles (Agency 2020; IEA 2021b).  

The energy policy landscape continues to evolve 

The  current  energy  sector  policy  landscape  consists  of  policy  mixes  or  policy  packages,  including 
regulatory, market-based and other approaches. These mixes have evolved over time and include many 
sectoral but also some economy-wide policy instruments, such as carbon pricing, subsidies.  

Governments have chosen a mix of policies and institutional mechanisms that consists of regulatory 
instruments,  like  efficiency  and  technology  standards,  economic  instruments  (e.g.  carbon  pricing, 
subsidies)  (Bertram  et  al.  2015;  Martin  and  Saikawa  2017)  and  other  policies,  such  as  government 
interventions to provide infrastructure, information policies, and voluntary actions by non-government 
actors  (Somanathan  et  al.  2014).  In  recent  years,  regulatory  instruments  to  promote  low-carbon 
infrastructure have gained traction in developing countries  (Finon 2019). The choice of policies has 
depended  on  institutional  capacities,  technological  maturity  and  other  developmental  priorities  of 
governments.  For  example,  governments  have  favoured  regulatory  instruments  over  economic 
instruments  when  there  has  been  sufficient  institutional  capacity  to  implement  and  monitor  the 
regulations and standards (Hughes and Urpelainen 2015). Furthermore, institutional capacity has also 
determined  the  extent  of  implemented  measures  (Adenle  et  al.  2017).  Market  conditions  and 
technological maturity are other important determinants of policy mixes being deployed in the energy

sector.  For  example,  subsidies  for  mitigation  like  feed-in-tariffs  (FIT)  have  worked  best  when  the 
technologies are in nascent stages of development (Gupta et al. 2019a).  

On the other hand, market-based instruments like emission trading schemes (ETS) and auctions coupled 
with a regulatory framework have been a favourable strategy for more mature technologies (Polzin et 
al. 2015; Kitzing et al. 2018). FIT, tax incentives, and renewable portfolio standards - despite potentially 
substantial program costs (Andor and Voss 2016; Abrell et al. 2019) - have played a significant role in 
attracting foreign direct investments in the renewable sector (Wall et al. 2019). Subsidies and carbon 
pricing have also played an important role in mainstreaming these renewable energy sources (Best and 
Burke 2018). Recently, subsidy-free investments in renewables, e.g. wind offshore (Jansen et al. 2020), 
backed by power purchase agreements, have gained momentum (Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre and 
BNEF  2020).  Similar  considerations  apply  for  policy  mixes  targeted  to  other  sectors,  for  example 
transport and buildings. 

The role of carbon pricing is still limited though increasing. Different measures have been suggested to 
improve the performance of the ETS, such as “price floors and caps” and other carbon pricing schemes 
(Bataille et al. 2018; Campiglio 2016; Goulder and Morgenstern 2018). In 2020, 61 regional, national 
and sub-national carbon pricing instruments, representing 22% of the global GHG emissions, were in 
action or scheduled for implementation (World Bank 2019). Over 51% of emissions covered are priced 
at less than USD 10 per tCO2-e.. At present, however, only 5% of the global emissions covered under 
carbon pricing initiatives are consistent with the range of carbon prices that have been suggested as 
needed  to  limit  warming  to  well  below  2°C  (Stiglitz  and  Stern  2017).  Most  of  the  carbon  pricing 
schemes have taken place in the OECD countries. The limited application of carbon pricing instruments 
in developing, and emerging economies may be due to political economy constraints  (Campiglio 2016; 
Finon 2019). Carbon pricing had a sizeable impact on emissions , e.g. the EU ETS impacts emissions 
from electricity in Germany (Schäfer 2019) and manufacturing in France (Colmer et al.), respectively. 
Emission  reductions  could  be  increased  with  higher  carbon  prices  and  without  free  allocation  of 
allowances.  

In  the  absence  of  a  global  comprehensive  carbon  price,  regional  regulatory  policies  for  fossil  fuels 
supply and key demand sectors like transport, industry and buildings (Chapters 9-11), coupled with 
regional carbon pricing instruments, were implemented to help initiating the climate actions consistent 
with  the  Paris  agreement  (Kriegler  et  al.  2018).  However,  differences  in  the  stringency  of  climate 
regulation  has  triggered  fear  that  regulation  reduces  the  competitiveness  of  industries  in  regulated 
countries and lead to industry re-location and “carbon leakage” (Schenker et al. 2018). In recent years, 
however, there is little evidence of carbon leakage (Schäfer 2019; Naegele and Zaklan 2019), and even 
positive  effects  of  carbon  pricing  on  efficiency  have  been  observed  (e.g.,  Löschel  et  al.  2019,  for 
German  manufacturing  firms,  and  (Germeshausen  2020)  for  German  power  plants).  However,  with 
asymmetric  rising  carbon  prices,  discussions  about  specific  policy  mechanisms  to  address  carbon 
leakage  like  carbon  border  adjustments  (Cosbey  et  al.  2019)  were  amplified.  Furthermore,  multiple 
policies - often implemented by different governmental levels (national vs subnational) - interacted with 
each  other  and  thereby  affected  their  environmental  and  economic  effectiveness.  Recent  examples 
include interactions of ETS with renewable support policies (e.g. Boehringer and Behrens 2015; Del 
Rio 2017), energy efficiency policies (e.g. Wiese et al. 2018) or electricity market reform (e.g. Teng et 
al. 2017), respectively.  

Apart from explicit carbon pricing, various implicit carbon pricing mechanisms such as fossil fuel taxes 
and removal of fossil fuel subsidies (see Box 6.3) and regulatory instruments are used by many countries 
as  part  of  their  climate  policies.  In  addition,  public  provision  and  procurement  of  low-carbon 
infrastructure and technologies  such  as  energy-efficient  devices, renewable  energy,  and upgrades  in 
electricity  grids  through  state-sponsored  institutions  and  public-private  partnerships  have  played  an 
important role in low-carbon development (e.g., (Baron 2016)).

Box  6.3 Energy Subsidies 

Energy subsidies continue to be widely applied. Global fossil fuel subsidies represent more than half of 
total energy subsidies with predominantly adverse environmental, economic, and social effects (high 
confidence).  

Energy  subsidies  can  be  defined  as  policy  measures  in  the  energy  sector  to  lower  the  prices  for 
consumers,  raise the  prices  for  producers,  or reduce  energy  production  costs  (IEA  1999).  There  are 
subsidies for fossil fuels, renewables, and energy efficiency measures. The majority of the renewable 
subsidies are generation-based incentives for solar, wind or biomass in the form of feed-in-tariffs (FIT) 
(Chapter  13),  with total annual renewable  subsidy  estimates  of about  USD  150 billion  yr-1  globally  
(IEA 2018b). Estimates of fossil fuel subsidies can vary by an order of magnitude. For the year 2017, 
the IEA estimated fossil fuel subsidies of USD 300 billion using IEA’s pre-tax, price-gap method (IEA 
2018b), while the IMF included unpriced externalities in calculating subsidies of USD 5.2 trillion or 
6.5% of global GDP (World Bank 2019; Coady et al. 2017, 2019). It has been estimated that the amount 
spent on fossil fuel subsidies was around double the amount of subsidies spent on renewables  (IEA 
2018b). There are adverse environmental, economic and social consequences of fossil fuel subsidies 
(Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). More than 75% of the distortions created by fossil fuel subsidies are 
domestic, and studies indicate that reforming them can have substantial in-country benefits (Coady et 
al. 2019, 2017). Some of the G-20 countries have implemented subsidy reforms based on low oil prices 
(Jewell et al. 2018).  

Fossil fuel subsidies most commonly pursue non-climate objectives, for example, enhanced access to 
energy  sources  (high  confidence).  In  some  cases,  these  energy  access  subsidies  have  helped  extend 
modern energy sources to the poor (Kimemia and Annegarn 2016) and thereby contribute to SDG-7. 
However, the subsidies have proven to be regressive in most cases, with little benefit reaching the poor 
(Lockwood 2015). For example, Indonesia has introduced liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidies for 
cooking. The kerosene to LPG conversion program (“Zero Kero”) was launched in 2007 and provided 
mainly households with free initial LPG equipment and LPG at a low subsidized price (Thoday et al. 
2018;  Imelda  et  al.  2018b).  Besides  the  national  government,  provincial  governments  and  industry 
played a crucial role in implementation. Overall, the LPG conversion program in Indonesia reduced 
cooking kerosene use (Andadari et al. 2014; Imelda et al. 2018b) and GHG emissions (Permadi et al. 
2017) with positive health effects (Thoday et al. 2018; Imelda et al. 2018b). However, the program is 
generally viewed as regressive and has failed to reduce traditional solid fuel use (Andadari et al. 2014; 
Toft 2016; Thoday et al. 2018). Furthermore, even if the program decreased greenhouse gas emissions 
relative to continued kerosene use, these subsidies are still targeted at fossil fuels and contribute to GHG 
emissions.  

India started a large LPG program in 2015 that provided a capital cost subsidy to poor households (e.g. 
Kar et al. 2019; Jose et al. 2018; Gould 2018). While the program has increased adoption of LPG in 
India (e.g. Sharma et al. 2019), it has not yet achieved a sustained use of LPG and replacement of solid 
fuels for cooking, amplifying the need for complementary policy measures  ( Gould 2018; Kar et al. 
2019; Mani et al. 2020). The climate impacts of switching from biomass to LPG depend on the degree 
of  biomass  combustion  in  stoves  and  the  extent  to  which  biomass  originates  from  non-renewable 
sources (Jose et al. 2018; Singh and Rao 2015). Barriers to increasing LPG use for cooking further 
included abundance of solid fuels at zero (monetary) costs (Mani et al. 2020) as well as benefits of solid 
fuels, such as maintaining the traditional taste of food and space heating in colder seasons (Gould 2018; 
Sharma et al. 2020).

6.4  Mitigation Options 

6.4.1  Elements of Characterization 

This section characterizes energy  system mitigation options and  discusses  which  factors  enable  and 
inhibit  their  implementation.  We  touch  on  a  broad  range  of  factors  that  may  enable  and  inhibit  the 
implementation of mitigation options by considering six dimensions that affect their feasibility (Table 
6.1,  Annex  II.11).    The  assessment  aims  to  identify  which  mitigation  options  can  be  readily 
implemented and which face barriers that would need to be overcome before they can be deployed at 
scale.

are anticipated to decline by an additional 16% by 2030 if current trends continue (low confidence, 
medium evidence). Key areas for continued improvement are grid integration and non-module costs for 
rooftop  systems  (high  confidence).  Most  deployment  is  now  utility-scale  (high  confidence).  Global 
future  potential  is  not  limited  by  solar  irradiation,  but  by  grid  integration  needed  to  address  its 
variability, as well as access to finance, particularly in developing countries (high confidence). 

The global technical potential of  direct solar energy far exceeds that of any other renewable energy 
resource and is well beyond the total amount of energy needed to support ambitious mitigation over the 
current  century  (high  confidence).  Estimates  of  global  solar  resources  have  not  changed  since  AR5 
(Lewis 2007; Besharat et al. 2013) even as precision and near-term forecasting have improved (Abreu 
et al. 2018; Diagne et al. 2013). Approximately 120,000 TW of sunlight reaches the Earth’s surface 
continuously,  almost  10,000  times  average  world  energy  consumption;  factoring  in  competition  for 
land-use leaves a technical potential of about 300 PWh yr-1 (1080 EJ yr-1) for solar PV, roughly double 
current consumption (Dupont et al. 2020). The technical potential for concentrating solar power (CSP) 
is estimated to be 45–82 PWh yr-1 (162–295 EJ yr-1) (Dupont et al. 2020). Areas with the highest solar 
irradiation are western South America; northern, eastern and southwestern Africa; and the Middle East 
and Australia (Figure 6.7) (Prăvălie et al. 2019). 

In many parts of the world, the cost of electricity from PV is below the cost of electricity generated 
from fossil fuels, and in some, it is below the operating costs of electricity generated from fossil fuels 
(high confidence). The weighted average cost of PV in 2019 was USD 68 MWh-1, near the bottom of 
the range of fossil fuel prices (IRENA 2019b). The cost of electricity from PV has fallen by 89% since 
2000 and 69% since AR5, at a rate of –16% per year. The 5:95 percentile range for PV in 2019 was 
USD  52–190  MWh-1  (IRENA  2021b).  Differences  in  solar  insolation,  financing  costs,  equipment 
acquisition, installation labour, and other sources of price dispersion explain this range  (Nemet et al. 
2016; Vartiainen et al. 2020) and scale. For example, in India, rooftop installations cost 41% more than 
utility-scale  installations,  and  commercial-scale  costs  are  39%  higher  than  utility-scale.  Significant 
differences in regional cost persist (Kazhamiaka et al. 2017; Vartiainen et al. 2020), with particularly 
low prices in China, India, and parts of Europe. Globally, the range of global PV costs is quite similar 
to the range of coal and natural gas prices.

Source: Global Solar Atlas (ESMAP 2019) 
PV costs (Figure 6.8) have fallen for various reasons: lower silicon costs, automation, lower margins, 
automation, higher efficiency, and a variety of incremental improvements (Fu et al. 2018; Green 2019) 
(Chapter 16). Increasingly, the costs of PV electricity are concentrated in the installation and related 
“soft  costs”  (marketing,  permitting)  associated  with  the  technology  rather  than  in  the  modules 
themselves, which now account for only 30% of installed costs of rooftop systems (O’Shaughnessy et

al. 2019; IRENA 2021b). Financing costs are a significant barrier in developing countries (Ondraczek 
et al. 2015) and growth there depends on access to low-cost finance (Creutzig et al. 2017). 

CSP costs have also fallen, albeit at about half the rate of PV: –9% yr-1 since AR5. The lowest prices 
for CSP are now competitive with more expensive fossil fuels, although the average CSP cost is above 
the fossil range. Other data sources put recent CSP costs at USD 120 MWh-1, in the middle of the fossil 
range (Lilliestam et al. 2020). Continuing the pace of change since AR5 will make CSP competitive 
with fossil fuels in sunny locations, although it will be difficult for CSP to compete with PV and even 
hybrid PV-battery systems. CSP electricity can be more valuable, however, because CSP systems can 
store heat longer than PV battery systems. 

Figure 6.8 Levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of solar energy technologies 2000–2020. Range of fossil 
fuel LCOE indicated as dashed lines USD 50–177 MWh-1. Linear fit lines were applied to data for AR4–
AR5 and post-AR5 (2012). Red dots are capacity-weighted global averages for utility-scale installations. 
The blue area shows the range between the 5th and 95th percentile in each year. Data: ( IRENA 2021b). 

The  share  of  total  costs  of  PV-intensive  electricity  systems  attributed  to  integration  costs  has  been 
increasing  but  can  be  reduced  by  enhancing  grid  flexibility  (Section  6.4.3,  6.6,  Box  6.8)  (high 
confidence). The total costs of PV include grid integration, which varies tremendously depending on 
PV's share of electricity, other supply sources like wind, availability of storage, transmission capacity, 
and demand flexibility (Heptonstall and Gross 2020). Transmission costs can add USD 1–10 MWh-1 or 
3–33% to the cost of utility-scale PV (Gorman et al. 2019). Distributed (rooftop) PV involves a broader 
set of grid integration costs - including grid reinforcement, voltage balancing and control, and impacts 
on other generations - and has a larger range of integration costs from USD 2–25 MWh-1, which is –3% 
to +37% (Hirth et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2015; Gorman et al. 2019). Other meta-analyses put the range at 
USD 1–7 MWh-1 in the USA (Luckow et al.; Wiser et al. 2017), while a comprehensive study put the 
range at USD 12–18 MWh-1 for up to 35% renewables and USD 25–46 MWh-1 above 35% renewables 
(Heptonstall and Gross 2020). Increased system flexibility can reduce integration costs of solar energy 
(Wu et al. 2015) including storage, demand response, sector-coupling (Bogdanov et al. 2019; Brown et 
al. 2018), and increase complementarity between wind and solar (Heide et al. 2010) (Sections 6.4.3 and 
6.4.4).  

Since solar PV panels have very low-operating costs, they can, at high penetrations and in the absence 
of  adequate  incentives  to  shift  demand,  depress  prices  in  wholesale  electricity  markets,  making  it 
difficult to recoup investment and  potentially  reducing  incentives for  new  installations  (Hirth 2013; 
Millstein et al. 2021). Continued cost reductions help address this issue of value deflation, but only 
partially. Comprehensive solutions depend on adding transmission and storage (Das et al. 2020) and, 
more fundamentally, adjustments to electricity market design (Bistline and Young 2019; Roques and 
Finon 2017).

The most important ways to minimize PVs impact on the environment lie in recycling materials at end 
of life and making smart land-use decisions (medium confidence). A comprehensive assessment of PVs 
environmental impacts requires life-cycle analysis (LCA) of resource depletion, land-use, ecotoxicity, 
eutrophication, acidification, ozone, and particulates, among other things (Mahmud et al. 2018). LCA 
studies show that solar PVs produce far less CO2 per unit of electricity than fossil generation, but PV 
CO2 emissions vary due to the carbon intensity of manufacturing energy and offset electricity (Grant 
and Hicks 2020). Concerns about systemic impacts, such as reducing the Earth’s albedo by covering 
surfaces with dark panels, have shown to be trivial compared to the mitigation benefits (Nemet 2009) 
(Box 6.7). Even though GHG LCA estimates span a considerable range of 9–250 gCO2 kWh-1 (de Wild-
Scholten  2013;  Kommalapati  et  al.  2017),  recent  studies  that  reflect  higher  efficiencies  and 
manufacturing improvements find lower life-cycle emissions, including a range of 18–60 gCO2 kWh-1 
(Wetzel and Borchers 2015) and central estimates of 80 gCO2 kWh-1 (Hou et al. 2016), 50 gCO2 kWh-
1 (Nugent and Sovacool 2014), and 20 gCO2 kWh-1 (Louwen et al. 2016).  These recent values are an 
order of magnitude lower than coal and natural gas and further decarbonization of the energy system 
will make them lower still. Thin films and organics produce half the life-cycle emissions of silicon 
wafer PV, mainly because they use less material (Lizin et al. 2013; Hou et al. 2016). Novel materials 
promise even lower environmental impacts, especially with improvements to their performance ratios 
and  reliability  (Gong  et  al.  2015;  Muteri  et  al.  2020).  Higher  efficiencies,  longer  lifetimes,  sunny 
locations, less carbon intensive manufacturing inputs, and shifting to thin films could reduce future life-
cycle impacts. 

Another environmental concern with large PV power plants is the conversion of land to collect solar 
energy  (Hernandez  et  al.  2015).  Approximately  2  hectares  of  land  are  needed  for  1  MW  of  solar 
electricity capacity (Kabir et al. 2018; Perpiña Castillo et al. 2016); at 20% efficiency, a square of PV 
panels of 550 km by 550 km, comprising 0.2% of Earth’s land area, could meet global energy demand. 
Land conversion can have local impacts, especially near cities and where land used for solar competes 
with  alternative  uses, such  as  agriculture.  Large installations  can  also adversely  impact  biodiversity 
(Hernandez et al. 2014), especially where the above ground vegetation is cleared and soils are typically 
graded. Landscape fragmentation creates barriers to the movement of species. However, a variety of 
means  have  emerged  to  mitigate  land  use  issues.  Substitution  among  renewables  can  reduce  land 
conversion (Tröndle and Trondle 2020). Solar can be integrated with other uses through ‘agrivoltaics’ 
(the use of land for both agriculture and solar production) (Dupraz et al. 2011) by, for example, using 
shade-tolerant crops (Dinesh and Pearce 2016). Combining solar and agriculture can also create income 
diversification, reduced drought stress, higher solar output due to radiative cooling, and other benefits 
(Elamri et al. 2018; Hassanpour Adeh et al. 2018; Barron-Gafford et al. 2019). PV installations floating 
on water also avoid land-use conflicts (Sahu et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2020), as does dual-use infrastructure, 
such as landfills (Jäger-Waldau 2020) and reservoirs where evaporation can also be reduced (Farfan 
and Breyer 2018).  

Material demand for PV will likely increase substantially to limit warming to well below 2°C, but PV 
materials are widely available, have possible substitutes, and can be recycled (medium confidence) (Box 
6.4). The primary materials for PV are silicon, copper, glass, aluminium, and silver, the costliest being 
silicon and glass being the most essential by mass, at 70%. None of these materials is considered to be 
either critical or potentially scarce (IEA 2020e). Thin-film cells, such as amorphous silicon, cadmium 
telluride  and copper indium  gallium  diselenide  (CIGS),  use far less material  (though they  use more 
glass), but account for less than 10% of the global solar market. Other thin-films, such as those based 
on perovskites, organic solar cells, or earth-abundant, non-toxic materials such as kesterites, either on 
their own, or layered on silicon, could further reduce material use per energy produced. (Box 6.4) 

After  a  typical  lifetime  of  30  years  of  use,  PV  modules  can  be  recycled  to  prevent  environmental 
contamination  from  the  toxic  materials  within  them,  reusing  valuable  materials  and  avoiding  waste

accumulation. Recycling allows the reuse of nearly all - 83% in one study - of the components of PV 
modules,  other  than  plastics  (Ardente  et  al.  2019)  and  would  add  less  than  1%  to  lifecycle  GHG 
emissions (Latunussa et al. 2016). Glass accounts for 70% of the mass of a solar cell and is relatively 
easy to recycle. Recycling technology is advancing, but the scale and share of recycling is still small 
(Li et al. 2020d). By 2050, however, end-of-life PV could total 80 MT and comprise 10% of global 
electronic waste (Stolz and Frischknecht 2017), although most of it is glass. IEA runs a program to 
enable PV recycling by sharing best practices to minimise recycling life cycle impacts. Ensuring that a 
substantial  amount  of  panels  are  recycled  at  end  of  life  will  likely  require  policy  incentives,  as  the 
market value of the recovered materials, aside from aluminium and copper, is likely to be too low to 
justify  recycling  on  its  own  (Deng  et  al.  2019).  A  near-term  priority  is maximizing the  recovery of 
silver, silicon, and aluminium, the most valuable PV material components (Heath et al. 2020). 

Many  alternative  PV  materials  are  improving  in  efficiency  and  stability,  providing  longer-term 
pathways for continued PV costs reductions and better performance (high confidence). While solar PV 
based on  semi-conductors constructed  from  wafers of  silicon  still  captures  90% of  the market,  new 
designs and materials have the potential to reduce costs further, increase efficiency, reduce resource 
use, and open new applications. The most significant technological advance within silicon PV in the 
past ten years has been the widespread adoption of the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) design 
(Green 2015), which now accounts for the majority of production. This advance boosts efficiency over 
traditional  aluminium  backing  by  increasing  reflectivity  within  the  cell  and  reducing  electron  hole 
recombination (Blakers 2019). Bifacial modules increase efficiency by using reflected light from the 
ground or roof on the backside of modules (Guerrero-Lemus et al. 2016). Integrating PV into buildings 
can reduce overall costs and improve building energy performance (Shukla et al. 2016). Concentrating 
PV  uses  lenses  or  mirrors that  collect  and  concentrate  light  onto  high  efficiency  PV  cells  (Li  et  al. 
2020a).  Beyond  crystalline  silicon,  thin  films  of  amorphous  silicon,  cadmium  telluride,  and  copper 
indium gallium selenide (among others) have the potential for much lower costs while their efficiencies 
have increased (Green et al. 2019). Perovskites, inexpensive and easy to produce crystalline structures, 
have increased in efficiency by a factor of six in the past decade; the biggest challenge is light-induced 
degradation as well as finding lead-free efficient compounds or establish lead recycling at the end of 
the life cycle of the device (Petrus et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019b; Zhu et al. 2020). 
Organic solar cells are made of carbon-based semiconductors like the ones found in the displays made 
from organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and can be processed in thin films on large areas with 
scalable and fast coating processes on plastic substrates. The main challenges are raising the efficiency 
and  improving  their  lifetime  (Ma  et  al.  2020;  Riede  et  al.  2021).  Quantum  dots,  spherical  semi-
conductor  nano-crystals,  can  be  tuned  to  absorb  specific  wavelengths  of  sunlight  giving  them  the 
potential for high efficiency with very little material use (Kramer et al. 2015). A common challenge for 
all emerging solar cell technologies is developing the corresponding production equipment. Hybrids of 
silicon with layers of quantum dots and perovskites have the potential to take advantage of the benefits 
of all three, although those designs require that these new technologies have stability and scale that 
match those of silicon (Palmstrom et al. 2019; Chang et al. 2017). This broad array of alternatives to 
making PV from crystalline silicon offer realistic potential for lower costs, reduced material use, and 
higher efficiencies in future years (Victoria et al. 2021). 

Besides PV, alternative solar technologies exist, including CSP, which can provide special services in 
high-temperature  heat  and  diurnal  storage,  even  if  it  is  more  costly  than  PV  and  its  potential  for 
deployment is limited. CSP uses reflective surfaces, such as parabolic mirrors, to focus sunlight on a 
receiver to heat a working fluid, which is subsequently transformed into electricity (Islam et al. 2018). 
Solar  heating  and  cooling  are  also  well  established  technologies,  and  solar  energy  can  be  utilized 
directly for domestic or commercial applications such as drying, heating, cooling, and cooking (Ge et 
al.  2018).  Solar  chimneys,  still  purely  conceptual,  heat  air  using  large  transparent  greenhouse-like 
structures and channel the warm air to turbines in tall chimneys (Kasaeian et al. 2017). Solar energy

can also be used to produce solar fuels, for example, hydrogen or synthetic gas (syngas) (Nocera 2017; 
Montoya et al. 2016; Detz et al. 2018). In addition, research proceeds on space-based solar PV, which 
takes advantage of high insolation and a continuous solar resource (Kelzenberg et al. 2018), but faces 
the formidable obstacle of developing safe, efficient, and inexpensive microwave or laser transmission 
to the Earth’s surface (Yang et al. 2016). CSP is the most widely adopted of  these alternative solar 
technologies. 

Like PV, CSP facilities can deliver large amounts of power (up to 200 MW per unit) and maintain 
substantial thermal storage, which is valuable for load balancing over the diurnal cycle (McPherson et 
al. 2020). However, unlike PV, CSP can only use direct sunlight, constraining its cost-effectiveness to 
North Africa, the Middle East, Southern Africa, Australia, the Western U.S., parts of South America 
(Peru, Chile), the Western part of China, and Australia (Deng et al. 2015; Dupont et al. 2020). Parabolic 
troughs, central towers and parabolic dishes are the three leading solar thermal technologies (Wang et 
al. 2017d). Parabolic troughs represented approximately 70% of new capacity in 2018 with the balance 
made up by central tower plants (Islam et al. 2018). Especially promising research directions are on 
tower-based designs that can achieve high temperatures, useful for industrial heat and energy storage 
(Mehos et al. 2017), and direct steam generation designs (Islam et al. 2018). Costs of CSP have fallen 
by nearly half since AR5 (Figure 6.8) albeit at a slower rate than PV. Since AR5, almost all new CSP 
plants have storage (Figure 6.9)(Thonig 2020).

plant in MW (circle size).  Since AR5, almost all new CSP plants have storage (Thonig 2020). Data

Solar energy elicits favourable public responses in most countries (high confidence) (Bessette and Arvai 
2018; Hanger et al. 2016; Jobin and Siegrist 2018; Ma et al. 2015; Mcgowan and Sauter 2005; Hazboun 
and Boudet 2020; Roddis et al. 2019). Solar energy is perceived as clean and environmentally friendly 
with  few  downsides  (Faiers  and  Neame  2006;  Whitmarsh  et  al.  2011b).  Key  motivations  for 
homeowners to adopt photovoltaic systems are expected financial gains, environmental benefits, the 
desire to become more self-sufficient, and peer expectations (Korcaj et al. 2015; Palm 2017; Vasseur 
and  Kemp  2015).  Hence,  the  observability  of  photovoltaic  systems  can  facilitate  adoption  (Boudet 
2019). The main barriers to the adoption of solar PV by households are its high upfront costs, aesthetics, 
landlord-tenant incentives, and concerns about performance and reliability  (Whitmarsh et al. 2011b; 
Vasseur and Kemp 2015; Faiers and Neame 2006).

6.4.2.2  Wind Energy  

Wind power is increasingly competitive with other forms of electricity generation and is the low-cost 
option  in  many  applications  (high  confidence).  Costs  have  declined  by  18%  and  40%  on  land  and 
offshore  since  2015  (high  confidence),  and  further  reductions  can  be  expected  by  2030  (medium 
confidence). Critical areas for continued improvement are technology advancements and economies of 
scale (high confidence). Global future potential is primarily limited by onshore land availability in wind 
power-rich areas, lack of supporting infrastructure, grid integration, and access to finance (especially in 
developing countries) (high confidence). 

Energy from wind is abundant, and the estimated technical potentials surpass the total amount of energy 
needed to limit warming to well below 2°C (high confidence). Recent global estimates of potentially 
exploitable wind energy resource are in the range of 557–717 PWh yr-1 (2005–2580 EJ yr-1) (Eurek et 
al. 2017; Bosch et al. 2017, 2018; McKenna et al. 2022), or 20–30 times the 2017 global electricity 
demand.  Studies  have  suggested  that  ‘bottom-up’  approaches  may  overestimate  technical  potentials 
(Miller et al. 2015; Kleidon and Miller 2020). But even in the most conservative ‘top-down’ approaches, 
the technical wind potential surpasses the amount needed to limit warming to well below 2°C (Bosch 
et al. 2017; Eurek et al. 2017; Volker et al. 2017). The projected climate change mitigation from wind 
energy by 2100 ranges from 0.3°C–0.8°C depending on the precise socio-economic pathway and wind 
energy  expansion  scenario  followed  (Barthelmie  and  Pryor  2021).  Wind  resources  are  unevenly 
distributed over the globe and by time of the year (Petersen and Troen 2012), but potential hotspots 
exist on every continent (Figure 6.10) as expressed by the wind power density (a quantitative measure 
of  wind  energy  available  at  any  location).  Technical  potentials  for  onshore  wind  power  vary 
considerably, often because of inconsistent assessments of suitability factors (McKenna et al. 2020). 
The potential for offshore wind power is larger than for onshore because offshore wind is stronger and 
less variable (Bosch et al. 2018). Offshore wind is more expensive, however, because of higher costs 
for construction, maintenance, and transmission. Wind power varies at a range of time scales, from 
annual to sub-seconds; the effects of local short-term variability can be offset by power plant control, 
flexible grid integration, and storage (Barra et al. 2021) (section 6.4.3). In some regions, interannual 
variations in wind energy resources could be important for optimal power system design (Wohland et 
al. 2019a; Coker et al. 2020).

of the coastline. Source: Global Wind Atlas https://globalwindatlas.info/ 

Wind power cost reductions (Figure 6.11) are driven mainly by larger capacity turbines, larger rotor 
diameters  and  taller  hub  heights  -  larger  swept  areas  increase  the  energy  captured  and  the  capacity

factors for a given wind speed; taller towers provide access to higher wind speeds (Beiter et al. 2021). 
All major onshore wind markets have experienced rapid growth in both rotor diameter (from 81.2 m in 
2010 to 120 m in 2020) (IRENA 2021b), and average power ratings (from 1.9 MW in 2010 to 3 MW 
in 2020). The generation capacity of offshore wind turbines grew by  a factor of 3.7 in less than two 
decades,  from  1.6  MW  in  2000  to  6  MW  in  2020  (Wiser  et  al.  2021).  Floating  foundations  could 
revolutionize offshore wind power by tapping into the abundant wind potential in deeper waters. This 
technology  is  particularly  important  for  regions  where  coastal  waters  are  too  deep  for fixed-bottom 
wind turbines. Floating wind farms potentially offer economic and environmental benefits compared 
with fixed-bottom designs due to less-invasive activity on the seabed during installation, but the long-
term  ecological  effects  are  unknown  and  meteorological  conditions  further  offshore  and  in  deeper 
waters are harsher on wind turbine components (IRENA 2019c). A radical new class of wind energy 
converters has also been conceived under the name of Airborne Wind Energy Systems that can harvest 
strong, high-altitude winds (typically between 200–800m), which are inaccessible by traditional wind 
turbines (Cherubini et al. 2015). This technology has seen development and testing of small devices 
(Watson et al. 2019). 

Wind capacity factors have increased over the last decade (Figure 6.11). The capacity factor for onshore 
wind farms increased from 27% in 2010 to 36% in 2020 (IRENA 2021a). The global average offshore 
capacity factor has decreased from a peak of 45% in 2017. This has been driven by the increased share 
of offshore development in China, where projects are often near-shore and use smaller wind turbines 
than  in  Europe  (IRENA  2021b).  Improvements  in  capacity  factors  also  come  from  increased 
functionality of wind turbines and wind farms. Manufactures can adapt the wind turbine generator to 
the wind conditions. Turbines for windy sites have smaller generators and smaller specific capacity per 
rotor area, and therefore operate more efficiently and reach full capacity for a longer time period (Rohrig 
et al. 2019).  

Electricity from onshore wind is less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels in a growing 
number of markets (high confidence). The global average LCOE onshore declined by 38% from 2010 
to 2020 (Figure 6.11), reaching USD 0.039 kWh-1. However, the decrease in cost varies substantially 
by region. Since 2014, wind costs have declined more rapidly than the majority of experts predicted 
(Wiser  et  al.  2021).  New  modelling  projects  onshore  wind  LCOE  of  USD  .037  kWh-1  by  2030 
(Junginger et al. 2020a), and additional reductions of 37–39% have been predicted by 2050 (Wiser et 
al. 2021). The future cost of offshore wind is more uncertain because other aspects besides increases in 
capacity factors influence the cost (Junginger et al. 2020b).

and offshore (bottom) wind power of existing power plants per year (2010-2020). The shaded area 
represents the 5th and 95th percentiles and the red dashed line represents the fossil fuel cost range.

The cost of the turbine (including the towers) makes up the largest component of wind’s LCOE. Total 
installed costs for both onshore and offshore wind farms have decreased since 2015 (Figure 6.11), but 
the total installed costs for onshore wind projects are very site- and market-specific, as reflected in the 
range of LCOEs. China, India, and the U.S. have experienced the largest declines in total installed costs. 
In 2020, typical country-average total installed costs were around USD 1150 kW-1 in China and India, 
and between USD 1403–2472 kW-1 elsewhere (IRENA 2021b). Total installed costs of offshore wind 
farms declined by 12% between 2010 and 2020. But, because some of the new offshore wind projects 
have moved to deeper waters and further offshore, there are considerable year-to-year variations in their 
price (IRENA 2021b). Projects outside China in recent years have typically been built in deeper waters 
(10–55 m) and up to 120 km offshore, compared to around 10 m in 2001–2006, when distances rarely 
exceeded 20 km. With the shift to deeper waters and sites further from ports, the total installed costs of 
offshore wind farms rose, from an average of around USD 2500 kW-1 in 2000 to around USD 5127 kW-
1 by 2011–2014, before falling to around USD 3185 kW-1 in 2020 (IRENA 2020a). The full cost of 
wind  power  includes  the  transmission  and  system  integration  costs  (Sections  6.4.3,  6.4.6.  A  new 
technology in development is the co-location of wind and solar PV power farms, also known as hybrid 
power plants. Co-locating wind, solar PV, and batteries can lead to synergies in electricity generation, 
infrastructure, and land usage, which may lower the overall plant cost compared to single technology 
systems (Lindberg et al. 2021). 

Wind  power  plants  pose  relatively  low  environmental  impact,  but  sometimes  locally  significant 
ecological effects (high confidence). The environmental impact of wind technologies, including CO2 
emissions, is concentrated in the manufacturing, transport, and building stage and in disposal as the 
end-of-life of wind turbines is reached (Liu and Barlow 2017; Mishnaevsky 2021). The operation of 
wind turbines produces no waste or pollutants. The LCA for wind turbines is strongly influenced by the 
operating  lifetime,  quality  of  wind  resources,  conversion  efficiency,  and  size  of  the  wind  turbines

(Laurent  et  al.  2018;  Kaldellis  and  Apostolou  2017).  But,  all  wind  power  technologies  repay  their 
carbon footprint in less than a year (Bonou et al. 2016). 

Wind farms can cause local ecological impacts, including impacts on animal habitat and movements, 
biological concerns, bird and bat fatalities from collisions with rotating blades,  and health concerns 
(Morrison and Sinclair 2004). The impacts on animal habitats and collisions can be resolved or reduced 
by  selectively  stopping  some  wind  turbines  in  high  risk  locations,  often  without  affecting  the 
productivity of the wind farm (de Lucas et al. 2012). Many countries now require environmental studies 
of impacts of wind turbines on wildlife prior to project development, and, in some regions, shutdowns 
are required during active bird migration (de Lucas et al. 2012). Offshore wind farms can also impact 
migratory  birds  and  other  sea  species  (Hooper  et  al.  2017).  Floating  foundations  pose  lower 
environmental  impacts  at  build  stage  (IRENA  2019c),  but  their  cumulative  long-term  impacts  are 
unclear (Goodale and Milman 2016). Recent studies find weak associations between wind farm noise 
and measures of long-term human health (Poulsen et al. 2018a,b, 2019a,b). 

Public support for onshore and particularly offshore wind energy is generally high, although people 
may oppose specific wind farm projects (high confidence) (e.g., Rand and Hoen 2017; Steg 2018; Bell 
et al. 2005; Batel and Devine-Wright 2015). People generally believe that wind energy is associated 
with environmental benefits and that it is relatively cheap. Yet, some people believe wind turbines can 
cause  noise  and  visual  aesthetic  pollution,  threaten  places  of  symbolic  value  (Russell  et  al.  2020; 
Devine-Wright and Wiersma 2020), and have adverse effects on wildlife (Bates and Firestone 2015), 
which challenges public acceptability (Rand and Hoen 2017). Support for local wind projects is higher 
when people believe fair decision-making procedures have been implemented (Aitken 2010a; Dietz and 
Stern  2008).  Evidence  is  mixed  whether  distance  from  wind  turbines  or  financial  compensation 
increases public acceptability of wind turbines  (Hoen et al. 2019; Rand and Hoen 2017; Cass et al. 
2010; Rudolph et al. 2018). Offshore wind farms projects have higher public support, but can also face 
resistance (Rudolph et al. 2018; Bidwell 2017).  

Common economic barriers to wind development are high initial cost of capital, long payback periods, 
and inadequate access to capital. Optimal wind energy expansion is most likely to occur in the presence 
of  a  political  commitment  to  establish,  maintain,  and  improve  financial  support  instruments, 
technological efforts to support a local supply chains, and grid investments integrate VRE electricity 
(Diógenes et al. 2020).

Box 6.4 Critical strategic minerals and a low-carbon energy system transition 

The secure supply of many metals and minerals (e.g., cobalt, copper, lithium, and rare earth elements, 
REEs) is critical to supporting a low-emissions energy system transition (Sovacool et al. 2020). A low-
carbon energy system transition will increase the demand for these minerals to be used in technologies 
like wind turbines, PV cells, and batteries (World Bank 2020). Reliance on these minerals has raised 
questions about possible constraints to a low-carbon energy system transition, including supply chain 
disruptions (Chapter 10.6). Concerns have also been raised about mining for these materials, which 
frequently results in severe environmental impacts (Sonter et al. 2020), and metal production itself is 
energy-intensive and difficult to decarbonize (Sovacool et al. 2020). 

Wind energy depends on two critical REEs - neodymium and dysprosium - used in magnets in high-
performance  generators  (Pavel  et  al.  2017;  Li  et  al.  2020b).  Silicon-wafer-based  solar  PV,  which 
accounted for 95% of PV production in 2020, does not use REEs but utilizes aluminium, copper, and 
silver  (IEA  2021a).  Lithium,  nickel,  cobalt,  and  phosphorous  are  used  in  batteries.  Many  critical 
minerals are used in EVs, including aluminium and copper in manufacturing the necessary EV charging 
infrastructure, and neodymium in permanent magnet motors.

These strategic minerals are found in a limited number of countries, and concerns have been raised that 
geopolitical factors could disrupt the supply chain necessary for a low-carbon energy system transition. 
However, excluding cobalt and lithium, no single country holds more than a third of the world reserves. 
The known supply of some strategic minerals is still close to 600 years at current levels of demand (BP 
2020), but increased demand would cut more quickly into supplies.   

There are alternatives to the strategic minerals currently used to support a low-carbon transition. Wind 
turbines can be manufactured without permanent magnets to reduce the need for strategic minerals, but 
the  production  costs  are  higher,  and  their  efficiency  is  reduced  (Månberger  and  Stenqvist  2018). 
Alternatives to  silicon,  such  as  thin  films,  could  be  used to produce  PVs.  Thin-films  use much less 
material  than  silicon-based  PV,  but  they  contain  other  potentially  critical  metals  like  tellurium, 
cadmium, and gallium. Alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, are becoming 
more practical and feasible (Sovacool et al. 2020).

6.4.2.3  Hydroelectric Power 

Hydropower is technically mature, proved worldwide as a primary source of renewable electricity, and 
may  be  used  to  balance  electricity  supply  by  providing  flexibility  and  storage.  The  LCOE  of 
hydropower  is  lower  than  the  cheapest  new  fossil  fuel-fired  option.  However,  the  future  mitigation 
potential of hydropower depends on minimizing environmental and social impacts during the planning 
stages,  reducing  the  risks  of  dam  failures,  and  modernising  the  aging  hydropower  fleet  to  increase 
generation capacity and flexibility (high confidence). 

Estimates of global gross theoretical available hydropower potential varies from 31–128 PWh yr-1 (112–
460 EJ yr-1), exceeding total electricity production in 2018 (Banerjee et al. 2017; IEA 2021d; BP 2020). 
This potential is distributed over 11.8 million locations (Figure 6.12), but many of the locations cannot 
be developed for (current) technical, economic, or political reasons. The estimated technical potential 
of hydropower is 8–30 PWh yr-1 (29–108 EJ yr-1), and its estimated economic potential is 8–15 PWh 
yr-1 (29–54 EJ yr-1) (van Vliet et al. 2016c; Zhou et al. 2015). Actual hydropower generation in 2019 
was 4.2 PWh (15.3 EJ), providing about 16% of global electricity and 43% of global electricity from 
renewables  (BP  2020;  Killingtveit  2020;  IEA  2020f).  Asia  holds  the  largest  hydropower  potential 
(48%), followed by S. America (19%) (Hoes et al. 2017). 

Figure 6.12 Global map of gross hydropower potential distribution [GWh yr-1], Data: (Hoes et al. 2017) 

Hydropower is a mature technology with locally adapted solutions (high confidence) (Zhou et al. 2015; 
Killingtveit 2020). The peak efficiency of hydroelectric plants is greater than 85%. Hydropower plants 
without storage or with small storage typically produce a few kWs to 10 MWs (examples of such plants 
producing higher amounts do exist), and are useful for providing electricity at a scale from households

to small communities (El Bassam et al. 2013; Towler 2014). However, hydropower plants without or 
with small storage may be susceptible to climate variability, especially droughts, when the amount of 
water may not be sufficient to generate electricity (see Section 6.5, Premalatha et al. 2014). 

Hydropower plants with storage may produce 10 GW, reaching over 100 TWh yr-1 (0.36 EJ yr-1), but 
generally require large areas. Pumped storage hydropower stores energy by pumping water to higher 
reservoirs during low-demand periods (Killingtveit 2020). The storage in hydropower systems provides 
flexibility  to  compensate  for  rapid  variations  in  electricity  loads  and  supplies.  The  regulating 
characteristics  of  the  storage  play  an  important  role  in  assuring  continuity  of  energy  supply  from 
renewable sources (Yang et al. 2018b).  

Hydropower is one of the lowest-cost electricity technologies (Mukheibir 2013; IRENA 2021b). Its 
operation and maintenance costs are typically 2–2.5% of the investment costs per kW yr-1 for a lifetime 
of 40–80 years (Killingtveit 2020). Construction costs are site specific. The total cost for an installed 
large hydropower project varies from USD 10,600–804,500 kW-1 if the site is located far away from 
transmission lines, roads, and infrastructure. Investment costs increase for small hydropower plants and 
may be as high as USD 100,000 kW-1 or more for the installation of plants of less than 1 MW - 20% to 
80% more than for large hydropower plants (IRENA 2015). During the past 100 years, total installed 
costs and LCOE have risen by a few percent, but the LCOE of hydropower remains lower than the 
cheapest new fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA 2019b, 2021).   

Hydroelectric  power  plants  may  pose  serious  environmental  and  societal  impacts  (high  confidence) 
(Mccartney 2009). Dams may lead to fragmentation of ecological habitats because they act as barriers 
for migration of fish and other land and water-borne fauna, sediments, and water flow. These barriers 
can be mitigated by sediment passes and fish migration aids, and with provision of environmental flows. 
Below  dams,  there  can  be  considerable  alterations  to  vegetation,  natural  river  flows,  retention  of 
sediments and nutrients, and water quality and temperature. Construction of large reservoirs leads to 
loss  of  land,  which  may  result  in  social  and  environmental  consequences.  Minimizing  societal  and 
environmental  impacts  requires  taking  into  account  local  physical,  environmental,  climatological, 
social, economic, and political aspects during the planning stage (Killingtveit 2020). Moreover, when 
large  areas  of  land  are  flooded  by  dam  construction,  they  generate  GHGs  (Phyoe  and  Wang  2019; 
Maavara et al. 2020; Prairie et al. 2018). On the other hand, hydropower provides flexible, competitive 
low-emission  electricity,  local  economic  benefits  (e.g.,  by  increasing  irrigation  and  electricity 
production in developing countries), and ancillary services such as municipal water supply, irrigation 
and drought management, navigation and recreation, and flood control (IRENA 2021b). However, the 
long term economic benefits to communities affected by reservoirs are a subject of debate  (de Faria et 
al. 2017; Catolico et al. 2021). 

Public support for hydroelectric energy is generally high (Steg 2018), and higher than support for coal, 
gas,  and  nuclear.  Yet,  public  support  for  hydro  seems  to  differ  for  existing  and  new  projects  (high 
confidence). Public support is generally high for small and medium scale hydropower in regions where 
hydropower was historically used (Gormally et al. 2014). Additionally, there is high support for existing 
large hydropower projects in Switzerland (Plum et al. 2019; Rudolf et al. 2014), Canada (Boyd et al. 
2019), and Norway (Karlstrøm and Ryghaug 2014), where it is a trusted and common energy source. 
Public  support  seems  lower  for  new  hydropower  projects  (Hazboun  and  Boudet  2020),  and  the 
construction  of  new  large  hydropower  plants  has  been  met  with  strong  resistance  in  some  areas 
(Bronfman et al., 2015; Vince, 2010). People generally perceive hydroelectric energy as clean and a 
non-contributor to climate change and environmental pollution (Kaldellis et al. 2013). For example, in 
Sweden, people believed that existing hydropower projects have as few negative environmental impacts 
as solar, and even less than wind (Ek 2005). However, in areas where the construction of new large-
scale hydroelectric energy is met with resistance, people believe that electricity generation from hydro 
can cause environmental, social, and personal risks (Bronfman et al., 2012; Kaldellis et al., 2013).

The construction time of hydroelectric power plants is longer than many other renewable technologies, 
and that construction time may be extended by the additional time it takes to fill the reservoir. This 
extended timeline can create  uncertainty in the completion  of  the  project.  The  uncertainty  is  due  to 
insecurity in year-to-year variations in precipitation and the water inflows required to fill reservoirs. 
This is especially critical in the case of trans-boundary hydroelectric power plants, where filling up the 
reservoirs can have large implications on downstream users in other nations. As a result of social and 
environmental  constraints,  only  a  small  fraction  of  potential  economic  hydropower  projects  can  be 
developed,  especially  in  developed  countries.  Many  developing  countries  have  major  undeveloped 
hydropower  potential,  and  there  are  opportunities  to  develop  hydropower  combined  with  other 
economic  activities  such  as  irrigation  (Lacombe  et  al.  2014).  Competition  for  hydropower  across 
country borders can lead to conflict, which could be exacerbated if climate alters rainfall and streamflow 
(Ito et al. 2016). 

6.4.2.4  Nuclear Energy  

Nuclear  power  can  deliver  low-carbon  energy  at  scale  (high  confidence).  Doing  so  will  require 
improvements in managing construction of reactor designs that hold the promise of lower costs  and 
broader use (medium confidence). At the same time, nuclear power continues to be affected by cost 
overruns,  high  up-front  investment  needs,  challenges  with  final  disposal  of  radioactive  waste,  and 
varying public acceptance and political support levels (high confidence). 

There are sufficient resources for substantially increasing nuclear deployment (medium confidence). 
Estimates for identified uranium resources have been increasing steadily over the years. Conventional 
uranium resources have been estimated to be sufficient for over 130 years of supply at current levels of 
use; 100 years were estimated in 2009 (Hahn 1983; NEA/IAEA 2021). In the case of future uranium 
resource  scarcity, thorium or  recycling  of  spent  fuel might  be  used  as  alternatives.  Interest  in these 
alternatives has waned with better understanding of uranium deposits, their availability, and low prices 
(OECD NEA 2015; IAEA 2005). 

There  are  several  possible  nuclear  technology  options  for  the  period  from  2030  to  2050  (medium 
confidence). In addition to electricity, nuclear can also be used to produce low-carbon hydrogen and 
freshwater (Kayfeci et al. 2019; Kavvadias and Khamis 2014) 

•  Large reactors. The nuclear industry has entered a new phase of reactor construction, based on 
evolutionary designs. These reactors achieve improvements over previous designs through small to 
moderate modifications, including improved redundancy, increased application of passive safety 
features, and significant improvements to containment design to reduce the risk of a major accident 
(MIT 2018). Examples include European  - EPR, Korean  - APR1400, U.S. -  AP1000, Chinese  - 
HPR1000 or Russian - VVER-1200. 

•  Long-term operation (LTO) of the current fleet. Continued production from nuclear power will 
depend in part on life extensions of the existing fleet. By the end  of 2020, two-thirds of nuclear 
power reactors will have been operational for over 30 years. The design lifetime of most of existing 
reactors is 30–40 years. Engineering assessments have established that reactors can operate safely 
for  longer  if  key  replaceable  components  (e.g.,  steam  generator,  mechanical  and  electrical 
equipment, instrumentation and control parts) are changed or refurbished (IAEA 2018). The first 
lifetime extension considered in most of the countries typically is 10–20 years (OECD IEA NEA 
2020).  

•  Small Modular Reactors. There are more than 70 SMR designs at different stages of consideration 
and  development,  from  the  conceptual  phase  to  licensing  and  construction  of  first-of-a-kind 
facilities  (IAEA  2020).  Due  to  smaller  unit  sizes,  the  SMRs  are  expected  to  have  lower  total 
investment costs, although the cost per unit of generation might be higher than conventional large 
reactors (Mignacca and Locatelli 2020). Modularity and off-site pre-production may allow greater 
efficiency in construction, shorter delivery times, and overall cost optimization (IEA 2019c). SMR

designs aim to offer an increased load-following capability that makes them suitable to operate in 
smaller systems and in systems with increasing shares of VRE sources. Their market development 
by  the  early  2030s  will  strongly  depend  on  the  successful  deployment  of  prototypes  during  the 
2020s. 

Nuclear  power  costs  vary  substantially  across  countries  (high  confidence).  First-of-a-kind  projects 
under construction in Northern America and Europe have been marked by delays and costs overruns 
(Berthelemy and Rangel 2015). Construction times have exceeded 13–15 years and cost has surpassed 
3–4 times initial budget estimates (OECD IEA NEA 2020). In contrast, most of the recent projects in 
Eastern Asia (with construction starts from 2012) were implemented within 5–6 years  (IAEA PRIS 
2021). In addition to region-specific factors, future nuclear costs will depend on the ability to benefit 
from the accumulated experience in controlling the main drivers of cost. These cost drivers fall into 
four categories: design maturity, project management, regulatory stability and predictability, and multi-
unit  and  series  effects  (NEA  2020).  With  lessons  learned  from  first-of-a-kind  projects,  the  cost  of 
electricity for new builds are expected to be in the range of USD 42–102 MWh-1 depending on the 
region (OECD IEA NEA 2020). 

Lifetime  extensions  are  significantly  cheaper  than  new  builds  and  cost  competitive  with  other  low-
carbon technologies. The overnight cost of lifetime extensions is estimated in the range of USD 390–
630  kWe-1  for  Europe  and  North  America,  and  the  LCOE  in  the  range  of  USD  30–36  MWh-1  for 
extensions of 10–20 years (OECD IEA NEA 2020). 

Cost-cutting opportunities, such as design standardization and innovations in construction approaches, 
are  expected  to  make  SMRs  competitive  against  large  reactors  by  2040  (Rubio  and  Tricot  2016) 
(medium confidence). As SMRs are under development, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the 
construction costs. Vendors have estimated first-of-a-kind LCOEs at USD 131–190 MWh-1. Effects of 
learning for nth-of-a-kind SMR are anticipated to reduce the first-of-a-kind LCOE by 19–32%.  

Despite low probabilities, the potential for major nuclear accidents exists, and the radiation exposure 
impacts could be large and long-lasting (Steinhauser et al. 2014). However, new reactor designs with 
passive and enhanced safety systems reduce the risk of such accidents significantly (high confidence). 
The (normal) activity of a nuclear reactor results in low volumes of radioactive waste, which requires 
strictly controlled and regulated disposal. On a global scale, roughly 421 ktons of spent nuclear fuel 
have been produced since 1971 (IEA 2014). Out of this volume, 2–3% is high-level radioactive waste, 
which  presents  challenges  in  terms  of  radiotoxicity  and  decay  longevity,  and  ultimately  entails 
permanent disposal.  

Nuclear  energy  is  found  to  be  favourable  regarding  land  occupation  (Cheng  and  Hammond  2017; 
Luderer et al. 2019) and ecological impacts (Brook and Bradshaw 2015; Gibon et al. 2017). Similarly, 
bulk material requirements per unit of energy produced are low (e.g. aluminum, copper, iron, rare earth 
metals)  (Vidal  et  al.  2013;  Luderer  et  al.  2019).  Water-intensive  inland  nuclear  power  plants  may 
contribute  to  localized  water  stress  and  competition  for  water  uses.  The  choice  of  cooling  systems 
(closed-loop instead of once-through) can significantly moderate withdrawal rates of the freshwater (Jin 
et al. 2019; Fricko et al. 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Meldrum et al. 2013). Reactors situated on the 
seashore are not affected by water scarcity issues (JRC EU 2021). Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies 
suggest that the overall impacts on human health (in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
from the normal operation of nuclear power plants are substantially lower than those caused by fossil 
fuel  technologies  and are  comparable  to  renewable  energy  sources  (Treyer  et  al.  2014;  Gibon et  al. 
2017). 

Nuclear power continues to suffer from limited public and political support in some countries (high 
confidence).  Public  support  for  nuclear  energy  is  consistently  lower  than  for  renewable  energy  and 
natural  gas,  and  in  many  countries  as  low  as  support  for  energy  from  coal  and  oil  (Hobman  and

Ashworth 2013; Corner et al. 2011; Pampel 2011). The major nuclear accidents (i.e. Three Mile Island, 
Chernobyl,  and  Fukushima)  decreased  public  support  (Poortinga  et  al.  2013;  Bird  et  al.  2014).  The 
public  remains  concerned  about  the  safety  risks  of  nuclear  power  plants  and  radioactive  materials 
(Tsujikawa et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2014; Pampel 2011). At the same time, some groups see nuclear 
energy as a reliable energy source, beneficial for the economy and helpful in climate change mitigation. 
Public support for nuclear energy is higher when people are concerned about energy security, including 
concerns about the availability of energy and high energy prices (Gupta et al. 2019b; Groot et al. 2013), 
and when they expect local benefit (Wang et al. 2020c). Public support also increases when trust in 
managing bodies is higher (de Groot and Steg 2011). Similarly, transparent and participative decision-
making processes enhance perceived procedural fairness and public support (Sjoberg 2004). 

Because of the sheer scale of the investment required (individual projects can exceed USD 10 billion in 
value), nearly 90% of nuclear power plants under construction are run by state-owned or controlled 
companies with governments assuming significant part of the risks and costs. For countries that choose 
nuclear power in their energy portfolio, stable political conditions and support, clear regulatory regimes, 
and adequate financial framework are crucial for successful and efficient implementation.  

Many countries have adopted technology-specific policies for low-carbon energy courses, and these 
policies  influence  the  competitiveness  of  nuclear  power.  For  example,  feed-in-tariffs  and  feed-in 
premiums  for  renewables  widely  applied  in  the  EU  (Kitzing  et  al.  2012)  or  renewable  portfolio 
standards in the U.S. (Barbose et al. 2016) impact wholesale electricity price (leading occasionally to 
low or even negative prices), which affects the revenues of existing nuclear and other plants (Bruninx 
et al. 2013; Newbery et al. 2018; Lesser 2019).  

Nuclear power’s long-term viability may hinge on demonstrating to the public and investors that there 
is a long-term solution to spent nuclear fuel. Evidence from countries steadily progressing towards first 
final disposals - Finland, Sweden and France - suggests that broad political support, coherent nuclear 
waste  policies,  and  a  well-managed,  consensus-based  decision-making  process  are  critical  for 
accelerating this process (Metlay 2016). Proliferation concerns surrounding nuclear power are related 
to fuel cycle (i.e., uranium enrichment and spent fuel processing). These processes are implemented in 
a very limited number of countries following strict national and internationals norms and rules, such as 
IAEA guidelines, treaties, and conventions. Most of the countries which might introduce nuclear power 
in the future for their climate change mitigation benefits do not envision developing their own full fuel 
cycle, significantly reducing any risks that might be linked to proliferation (IAEA 2014, 2019).  

6.4.2.5  Carbon Dioxide Capture, Utilization, and Storage 

Since AR5, there have been increased efforts to develop novel platforms that reduce the energy penalty 
associated with CO2 capture, develop CO2 utilization pathways as a substitute to geologic storage, and 
establish global policies to support CCS (high confidence). CCS can be used within electricity and other 
sectors. While it increases the costs of electricity, CCS has the potential to contribute significantly to 
low-carbon energy system transitions (IPCC 2018). 

The theoretical global geologic storage potential is about 10,000 Gt-CO2, with more than 80% of this 
capacity existing in saline aquifers (medium confidence). Not all the storage capacity is usable because 
geologic and engineering factors limit the actual storage capacity to an order of magnitude below the 
theoretical  potential,  which  is  still  more  than  the  CO2  storage  requirement  through  2100  to  limit 
temperature change to 1.5C (Martin-Roberts et al. 2021) (high confidence). One of the key limiting 
factors associated with geologic CO2 storage is the global distribution of storage capacity (Table 6.2). 
Most of the available storage capacity exists in saline aquifers. Capacity in oil and gas reservoirs and 
coalbed methane fields is limited. Storage potential in the U.S. alone is &gt;1,000 Gt-CO2, which is more 
than 10% of the world total (NETL 2015). The Middle East has more than 50% of global enhanced oil 
recovery potential (Selosse and Ricci 2017). It is likely that oil and gas reservoirs will  be developed

before saline aquifers because of existing infrastructure and extensive subsurface data (Alcalde et al. 
2019; Hastings and Smith 2020). Notably, not all geologic storage is utilizable. In places with limited 
geologic storage, international CCS chains are being considered, where sources and sinks of CO2 are 
located in two or more countries (Sharma and Xu 2021). For economic long-term storage, the desirable 
conditions are a depth of 800-3000 m, thickness of greater than 50 m and permeability greater than 500 
mD (Singh et al. 2020; Chadwick et al. 2008). Even in reservoirs with large storage potential, the rate 
of  injection  might  be  limited  by  the  subsurface  pressure  of  the  reservoir  (Baik  et  al.  2018a).  It  is 
estimated that geologic sequestration is safe with overall leakage rates at &lt;0.001% yr-1 (Alcalde et al. 
2018). In many cases, geological storage resources are not located close to CO2  sources, increasing 
costs and reduces viability (Garg et al. 2017a).

CO2  utilization  (CCU)  -  instead  of  geologic  storage  -  could  present  an  alternative  method  of 
decarbonization (high confidence). The global CO2 utilization potential, however, is currently limited 
to 1–2 GtCO2 yr-1 for use of CO2 as a feedstock (Hepburn et al. 2019; Kätelhön et al. 2019) but could 
increase to 20 GtCO2 by the mid-century (medium confidence). CCU involves using CO2 as a feedstock 
to synthesize products of economic value and as substitute to fossil feedstock. However, several CO2 
utilization avenues might be limited by energy availability. Depending on the utilization pathway, the 
CO2 may be considered sequestered for centuries (e.g., cement curing, aggregates), decades (plastics), 
or only a few days or months (e.g. fuels) (Hepburn et al. 2019). Moreover, when carbon-rich fuel end-
products  are  combusted,  CO2  is  emitted  back  into  the  atmosphere.  Because  of  presence  of  several 
industrial clusters (regions with high density of industrial infrastructure) globally, a number of regions 
demonstrate locations where CO2 utilization potential could be matched with large point sources of CO2 
(Wei et al. 2020). 

The technological development for several CO2 utilization pathways is still in the laboratory, prototype, 
and  pilot  phases,  while  others  have  been  fully  commercialized  (such  as  urea  manufacturing). 
Technology development in some end-uses is limited by purity requirements for CO2 as a feedstock. 
The efficacy of CCU processes depends on additional technological constraints such as CO2 purity and 
pressure requirements. For instance, urea production requires CO2 pressurized to 122 bar and purified 
to 99.9%. While most utilization pathways require purity levels of 95-99%, algae production may be 
carried out with atmospheric CO2 (Ho et al. 2019; Voldsund et al. 2016). 

Existing  post-combustion  approaches  relying  on  absorption  are  technologically  ready  for  full-scale 
deployment  (high  confidence).  More  novel  approaches  using  membranes  and  chemical  looping  that 
might reduce the energy penalty associated with absorption are in different stages of development  - 
ranging from laboratory phase to prototype phase (Abanades et al. 2015) (high confidence). There has 
been significant progress in post-combustion capture technologies that used absorption in solvents such 
as monoethanol amine (MEA). There are commercial-scale application of solvent-based absorption at 
two facilities – Boundary Dam since 2015 and Petra Nova (temporarily suspended) since 2017, with 
capacities of 1 and 1.6 MtCO2 yr-1 respectively (Mantripragada et al. 2019; Giannaris et al. 2020a).

Several 2nd and 3rd generation capture technologies are being developed with the aim of not just lowering 
costs but also enhancing other performance characteristics such as improved ramp-up and lower water 
consumption. These include processes such as chemical looping, which also has the advantage of being 
capable  of  co-firing  with  biomass  (Bhave  et  al.  2017;  Yang  et  al.  2019).  Another  important 
technological development is the Allam cycle, which utilizes CO2 as a working fluid and operates based 
on  oxy-combustion  capture.  Applications  using  the  Allam  Cycle  can  deliver  net  energy  efficiency 
greater than 50% and 100% CO2 capture, but they are quite sensitive to oxygen and CO2 purity needs 
(Scaccabarozzi et al. 2016; Ferrari et al. 2017).  

-1 for most technologies 
CO2 capture costs present a key challenge, remaining higher than USD 50 tCO2
and regions; novel technologies could help reduce some costs (high confidence). The capital cost of a 
coal or gas electricity generation facility with CCS is almost double one without CCS (Zhai and Rubin 
2016; Rubin et al. 2015; Bui et al. 2018). Additionally, the energy penalty increases the fuel requirement 
for electricity generation by 13–44%, leading to further cost increases (Table 6.3).

In addition to reductions in capture costs, other approaches to reduce CCS costs rely on utilizing the 
revenues from co-products such as oil, gas, or methanol, and on clustering of large-point sources to 
reduce infrastructure costs. The potential for such reductions is limited in several regions due to low 
sink  availability,  but  it  could  jumpstart  initial  investments  (medium  confidence).  Injecting  CO2  into 
hydrocarbon  formations  for  enhanced  oil  or  gas  recovery  can  produce  revenues  and  lower  costs 
(Edwards and Celia 2018). While enhanced oil recovery potential is &lt;5% of the actual CCS needs, they 
can enable early pilot and demonstration projects (Núñez-López and Moskal 2019; Núñez-López et al. 
2019). Substantial portions of CO2 are effectively stored during enhanced oil recovery (Sminchak et al. 
2020; Menefee and Ellis 2020). By clustering together of several CO2 sources, overall costs may be 
-1 (Abotalib et al. 2016; Garg et al. 2017a), but geographical circumstances 
reduced by USD 10 tCO2
determine  the  prospects  of  these  cost  reductions  via  economies-of-scale.  The  major  pathways  for 
-1 
methanol, methane, liquid fuel production, and cement curing have costs greater than USD 500 tCO2
(Hepburn et al. 2019). The success of these pathways therefore depends on the value of such fuels and 
on the values of other alternatives.  

The public is largely unfamiliar with carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies (Tcvetkov et 
al. 2019; L’Orange Seigo et al. 2014) (high confidence), and many people may not have formed stable 
attitudes and risk perceptions regarding these technologies (Daamen et al. 2006; Jones et al. 2015; Van 
Heek et al. 2017) (medium confidence). In general, low support has been reported for CCS technologies 
(Allen and Chatterton 2013; Demski et al. 2017). When presented with neutral information on CCS, 
people  favour  other  mitigation  options  such  as  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  (de  Best-
Waldhober et al. 2009; Scheer et al. 2013; Karlstrøm and Ryghaug 2014). Although few totally reject 
CCS, specific CCS projects have faced strong local resistance, which has contributed to the cancellation 
of CCS projects (Terwel et al. 2012; L’Orange Seigo et al. 2014). Communities may also consider CCU 
to be lower-risk and view it more favourably than CCS (Arning et al. 2019).

CCS requires considerable increases in some resources and chemicals, most notably water. Power plants 
with CCS could shutdown periodically due to water scarcity. In several cases, water withdrawals for 
CCS are 25–200% higher than plants without CCS (Yang et al. 2020; Rosa et al. 2020b) due to energy 
penalty and cooling duty. The increase is slightly lower for non-absorption technologies. In regions 
prone to water scarcity such as the Southwestern U.S. or Southeast Asia, this may limit deployment and 
result in power plant shutdowns during summer months (Liu et al. 2019b; Wang et al. 2019c). The water 
use could be managed by changing heat integration strategies and implementing reuse of wastewater 
(Magneschi et al. 2017; Giannaris et al. 2020b).

Because  CCS  always  adds  cost,  policy  instruments  are  required  for  it  to  be  widely  deployed  (high 
confidence). Relevant policy instruments include financial instruments such as emission certification 
and  trading,  legally  enforced  emission  restraints,  and  carbon  pricing  (Haszeldine  2016;  Kang  et  al. 
2020). There are some recent examples of policy instruments specifically focused on promoting CCS. 
The recent U.S. 45Q tax credits offers nationwide tax credits for CO2 capture projects above USD 35–
-1  which  offset  CO2  capture  costs  at  some  efficient  plants  (Esposito  et  al.  2019).  Similarly, 
50  tCO2
California’s low-carbon fuel standard offers benefits for CO2 capture at some industrial facilities such 
as biorefineries and refineries (Von Wald et al. 2020). 

6.4.2.6  Bioenergy  

Bioenergy  has  the  potential  to  be  a  high-value  and  large-scale  mitigation  option  to  support  many 
different parts of the energy system. Bioenergy could be particularly valuable for sectors with limited 
alternatives to fossil fuels (e.g., aviation, heavy industry), production of chemicals and products, and, 
potentially, in carbon dioxide removal (CDR) via BECCS or biochar. While traditional biomass and 
first-generation  biofuels  are  widely  used  today,  the  technology  for  large-scale  production  from 
advanced processes is not competitive, and growing dedicated bioenergy crops raises a broad set of 
sustainability concerns. Its long-term role in low-carbon energy systems is therefore uncertain (high 
confidence). [Note that this section focuses on the key technological developments for deployment of 
commercial bioenergy.] 

Bioenergy is versatile: technology pathways exist to produce multiple energy carriers from biomass - 
electricity, liquid fuels, gaseous fuels, hydrogen, and solid fuels - as well as other value-added products 
(high  confidence).  Different  chemical  and  biological  conversion  pathways  exist  to  convert  diverse 
biomass feedstocks into multiple final energy carriers (Figure 6.14). Currently, biomass is mostly used 
to produce heat or for cooking purposes (traditional biomass), electricity, or first-generation sugar-based

biofuels (e.g., ethanol produced via fermentation), as well as biodiesel produced from vegetable oils 
and animal fats. Electricity generated from biomass contributes about 3% of global generation. Tens of 
billions  of  gallons  of  first-generation  biofuels  are  produced  per  year.  The  processing  requirements 
(drying,  dewatering,  pelletizing)  of  different  feedstocks  for  producing  electricity  from  biomass  are 
energy-intensive,  and  when  utilizing  current  power  plants,  the  efficiency  is  around  22%,  with  an 
increase up to 28% with advanced technologies (Zhang et al. 2020). 

Scaling  up  bioenergy  use  will  require  advanced  technologies  such  as  gasification,  Fischer-Tropsch 
processing, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and pyrolysis. These pathways could deliver several final 
energy  carriers  starting  from  multiple  feedstocks,  including  forest  biomass,  dedicated  cellulosic 
feedstocks, crop residues, and wastes (Figure 6.14). While potentially cost-competitive in the future, 
pyrolysis, Fischer-Tropsch, and HTL are not currently cost-competitive (IEA 2018c; Molino et al. 2018; 
Prussi et al. 2019), and scaling-up these processes will require robust business strategies and optimized 
use of co-products (Lee and Lavoie 2013). Advanced biofuels production processes are at the pilot or 
demonstration  stage  and  will  require  substantial  breakthroughs  or  market  changes  to  become 
competitive.  Moreover,  fuels  produced  from  these  processes  require  upgrading  to  reach  “drop-in” 
conditions – that is, conditions in which they may be used directly consistent with current standards in 
existing  technologies  (van  Dyk  et  al.  2019).  Additional  opportunities  exist  to  co-optimize  second 
generation biofuels and engines (Ostadi et al. 2019; Salman et al. 2020). In addition, gaseous wastes, 
or high-moisture biomass, such as dairy manure, wastewater sludge and organic MSW could be utilized 
to produce renewable natural gas. Technologies for producing biogas (e.g. digestion) tend to be less 
efficient  than  thermochemical  approaches  and  often  produce  large  amounts  of  CO2,  requiring  the 
produced fuels to undergo significant upgrading (Melara et al. 2020).  

Figure 6.14 Range of advanced bioenergy conversion pathways (excluding traditional biomass, direct heat 
generation, first-generation biofuels, and non-energy products) based on feedstock, targeted end product, 
and compatibility with CDR via CCS and soil carbon sequestration (Modified from Baker et al, 2020)  

A major scale-up of bioenergy production will require dedicated production of advanced biofuels. First 
generation biofuels produced directly from food crops or animal fats both have limited potential and 
lower yield per land area than advanced biofuels. Wastes and residues (e.g., from agricultural, forestry, 
animal  manure  processing)  or  biomass  grown  on  degraded,  surplus,  and  marginal  land  can  provide 
opportunities  for  cost-effective  and  sustainable  bioenergy  at  significant  but  limited  scale  (Saha  and 
Eckelman 2018; Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2020; Spagnolo et al. 2020; Morris et al. 2013). Assessing 
the potential for a major scale-up of purpose-grown bioenergy is challenging due to its far-reaching 
linkages to issues beyond the energy sector, including competition with land for food production and 
forestry, water use, impacts on ecosystems, and land-use change) (IPCC 2020; Chapter 12; (Roe et al. 
2021)). These factors, rather than geophysical characteristics, largely define the potential for bioenergy

and explain the difference in estimates of potential in the literature. Biomass resources are not always 
in  close  proximity  to  energy  demand,  necessitating  additional  infrastructure  or  means  to  transport 
biomass or final bioenergy over larger distances and incur additional energy use  (Baik et al. 2018b; 
Singh et al. 2020).  

An  important feature  of  bioenergy  is that  it  can  be  used  to remove  carbon  from  the  atmosphere  by 
capturing  CO2  in  different  parts  of  the  conversion  process  and  then  permanently  storing  the  CO2 
(BECCS or biochar) (Chapter 3, Chapter 7; Chapter 12.5; Smith et al. 2016; Fuss et al. 2018). Some 
early opportunities for low-cost BECCS are being utilized in the ethanol sector but these are applicable 
only in the near-term at the scale of  ≤100 Mt-CO2 yr-1 (Sanchez et al. 2018). Several technological and 
institutional barriers exist for large-scale BECCS implementation, including large energy requirements 
for CCS, limit and cost of biomass supply and geologic sinks for CO2 in several regions, and cost of 
CO2 capture technologies (high confidence). Besides BECCS, biofuels production through pyrolysis 
and hydrothermal liquefaction creates biochar, which could also be used to store carbon as 80% of the 
carbon sequestered in biochar will remain in the biochar permanently (Chapter 7). In addition to its 
ability to sequester carbon, biochar can be used as a soil amendment (Wang et al. 2014b). 

First-generation bioenergy is currently competitive in some markets, though on average its costs are 
higher  than  other  forms  of  final  energy.  Bioenergy  from  waste  and  residues  from  forestry  and 
agriculture is also currently competitive, but the supply is limited  (Aguilar et al. 2020). These costs are 
context-dependent, and regions having large waste resources are already producing low-cost bioenergy 
(Jin and Sutherland 2018). In the future, technology costs are anticipated to decrease, but bioenergy 
produced through cellulosic feedstocks may remain more expensive than fossil alternatives. Large-scale 
deployment of early opportunities especially in the liquid fuel sector may reduce the technological costs 
associated with biomass conversion (IEA 2020g). At the same time, the cost of feedstocks may rise as 
bioenergy requirements increase, especially in scenarios with large bioenergy deployment (Muratori et 
al. 2020). The costs of bioenergy production pathways are highly uncertain (Table 6.4). 

Table 6.4 The costs of electricity generation, hydrogen production, and second-generation liquid fuels 
production from biomass in 2020. These costs are adapted from (Daioglou et al. 2020), (Bhave et al. 2017),

•  Electricity. The costs of baseload electricity production with biomass are higher than corresponding 
fossil electricity production with and without CCS, and are likely to remain as such without carbon 
pricing  (Bhave  et  al.  2017).  The  additional  cost  associated  with  CO2  capture  are  high  for 
conventional  solvent-based  technologies.  However,  upcoming  technologies  such  as  chemical 
looping are well-suited to biomass and could reduce CCS costs. 

•  Hydrogen.  The  costs  of  hydrogen  production  from  biomass  are  somewhat  higher  than,  but 
comparable, to that produced by natural gas reforming with CCS. Further, the incremental costs for 
incorporating CCS in this process are less than 5% of the levelized costs in some cases, since the

gasification route creates a high-purity stream of CO2 (Muratori et al. 2017a; Sunny et al. 2020). 
While these processes have fewer ongoing prototypes/demonstrations, the costs of biomass-based 
hydrogen  (with  or  without  CCS)  are  substantially  cheaper  than  that  produced  from  electrolysis 
utilizing solar/wind resources (Kayfeci et al. 2019; Newborough and Cooley 2020), even though 
electrolysis costs are dropping.  

•  Liquid Biofuels. First-generation sugar-based biofuels (e.g., ethanol produced via fermentation) or 
biodiesel produced from vegetable oils and animal fats are produced in several countries at large 
scale  and  costs  competitive  with  fossil  fuels.  However,  supply  is  limited.  The  costs  for  second 
generation processes (Fischer-Tropsch and cellulosic ethanol) are higher in most regions (Li et al. 
2019). Technological learning is projected to reduce these costs by half (IEA 2020g). 

Large-scale bioenergy production will require more than wastes/residues and cultivation on marginal 
lands, which may raise conflicts with SDGs relevant to environmental and societal priorities (Gerten et 
al. 2020; Heck et al. 2018) (Chapter 12). These include competition with food crops, implications for 
biodiversity, potential deforestation to support bioenergy crop production, energy security implications 
from bioenergy trade, point-of-use emissions and associated effects on air quality, and water use and 
fertilizer use (Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2018; Tanzer and Ramírez 2019; Fuss et al. 2018; Brack and 
King 2020). Overall, the environmental impact of bioenergy production at scale remains uncertain and 
varies by region and application.  

Alleviating  these  issues  would  require  some  combination  of  increasing  crop  yields,  improving 
conversion  efficiencies,  and  developing  advanced  biotechnologies  for  increasing  the  fuel  yield  per 
tonne  of  feedstock  (Henry  et  al.  2018).  Policy  structures  would  be  necessary  to  retain  biodiversity, 
manage water use, limit deforestation and land-use change emissions, and ultimately optimally integrate 
bioenergy with transforming ecosystems. Large-scale international trade of biomass might be required 
to support a global bioeconomy, raising questions about infrastructure, logistics, financing options, and 
global standards for bioenergy production and trade (Box 6.10). Additional institutional and economic 
barriers are associated with accounting of carbon dioxide removal, including BECCS (Fuss et al. 2014; 
Muratori et al. 2016; Fridahl and Lehtveer 2018).  

Life-cycle  emissions  impacts  from  bioenergy  are  subject  to  large  uncertainties  and  could  be 
incompatible with net zero emissions in some contexts. Due to the potentially large energy conversion 
requirements and associated GHG emissions (Chapter 7, Chapter 12), bioenergy systems may fail to 
deliver  near-zero  emissions  depending  on  operating  conditions  and  regional  contexts  (Staples  et  al. 
2017; Lade et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2017; Hanssen et al. 2020; Elshout et al. 2015). As a result, 
bioenergy carbon neutrality is debated and depends on factors such as the source of biomass, conversion 
pathways and energy used for production and transport of biomass, and land use changes, as well as 
assumed analysis boundary and considered timescale (Fan et al. 2021; Wiloso et al. 2016; Zanchi et al. 
2012; Booth 2018). Similarly, the lifecycle emissions of BECCS remain uncertain and will depend on 
how effectively bioenergy conversion processes are optimized (Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2017; Tanzer 
and Ramírez 2019).  

Acceptability of bioenergy is relatively low compared to other renewable energy sources like solar and 
wind   (Poortinga  et  al.  2013;  EPCC  2017;  Peterson  et  al.  2015;  Ma  et  al.  2015) and  comparable  to 
natural gas (Scheer et al. 2013). People also know relatively little about bioenergy compared to other 
energy  sources (Whitmarsh  et  al.  2011a;  EPCC  2017)  and  tend  be  be  more  ambivalent  towards 
bioenergy compared to other mitigation options (Allen and Chatterton 2013). People evaluate biomass 
from waste products (e.g., food waste) more favourably than grown-for-purpose energy crops, which 
are more controversial (Demski et al. 2015; Plate et al. 2010). The most pressing concerns for use of 
woody biomass are air pollution and loss of local forests (Plate et al. 2010). Various types of bioenergy 
additionally  raise  concerns  about  landscape  impacts  (Whitmarsh  et  al.  2011a)  and  biodiversity

possibly because it involves burning of material.

Box  6.5 Methane mitigation options for coal, oil, and gas 

Methane emissions mainly from coal, oil, and gas currently represent in 2019 about 18%  of energy 
supply sector GHG emissions and 90% of global energy supply non-CO2 emissions in 2019 (Minx et 
al. 2021b). While approximately 80% of the life-cycle methane emissions in the coal sector occur during 
underground  mining,  oil  and  gas  emissions  are  spread  throughout  upstream,  midstream,  and 
downstream stages (IPCC, 2019) (Alvarez et al. 2018). For this reason, methane reductions from coal 
mining  can  be  accomplished  through  coal  mine  methane  recovery  (where  methane  and  coal  are 
recovered simultaneously) and from the ventilation air, which can reduce methane emissions by 50–
75% (Singh and Hajra 2018; Zhou et al. 2016). Governments incentivize such operations through a 
number of emissions trading and offset programs (Haya et al. 2020). Methane emissions in the oil and 
gas sector can be reduced by leak detection and repair, relevant across varying time scales (hours to 
decades) and regional scopes (component/facility level to continental) (Fox et al. 2019). Around 50% 
of the methane emitted from oil and gas infrastructure can be mitigated at net-negative costs; that is, 
the market price of the recovered methane is higher than the mitigation costs  (IEA 2021e). As CO2 
emissions are reduced and fossil fuel consumption decreases, methane emissions associated with these 
supply chains are anticipated to decline (section 6.7). That said, substantial ‘legacy’ methane emissions 
– methane leaks after abandonment – will remain even if a complete fossil fuel phase-out takes place. 
These  legacy  emissions  are  estimated to  be less than  1–4%  of  overall methane emissions  across all 
fossil fuel sources (Kholod et al. 2020; Williams et al. 2021b). Even without a complete phase-out, 50-
80% of methane emissions from coal, oil and gas could be avoided with currently available technologies 
at less than USD 50 tCO2-eq-1 (Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020; Harmsen et al. 2019). Methane recovery 
from abandoned coal mines could offset most project costs (Singh and Sahu 2018). For abandoned oil 
and gas wells, low plugging costs could be offset through methane recovery, while high plugging costs 
would likely require some market or policy support (Kang et al. 2019). 

[END BOX 6.5 HERE] 

6.4.2.7. Fossil Energy 

Fossil fuels could play a role in climate change mitigation if strategically deployed with CCS (high 
confidence).  On  the  one  hand,  the  primary  mechanism  for  reducing  emissions  is  to  eliminate  the 
unabated fossil fuel use. On the other hand, fossil energy combined with CCS provides a means of 
producing low-carbon energy while still utilizing the available base of fossil energy worldwide and 
limiting stranded assets. While Section 6.4.2.5 discusses the important aspects of CCS with fossil fuels, 
this section aims to elucidate the feasibility criteria around these fuels itself. 

Fossil fuel reserves have continued to rise because of advanced exploration and utilization techniques 
(high confidence). A fraction of these available reserves can be used consistent with mitigation goals 
when  paired  with  CCS  opportunities  in  close  geographical  proximity  (high  confidence).  Based  on 
continued  exploration,  the  fossil  fuel  resource  base  has  increased  significantly;  for  example,  a  9% 
increase in gas reserves and 12% in oil reserves was observed in the U.S. between 2017 and 2018. This 
increase is a result of advanced exploration techniques, which are often subsidized (Lazarus and van 
Asselt  2018;  MA  et  al.  2018).  Fossil  reserves  are  distributed  unevenly  throughout  the  globe.  Coal 
represents the largest remaining resource (close to 500 ZJ). Conventional oil and gas resources are an 
order of magnitude smaller (15–20 ZJ each). Technological advances have increased the reserves of 
unconventional fossil in the last decade. Discovered ultimate recoverable resources of unconventional 
oil and gas are comparable to conventional oil and gas (Fizaine et al. 2017).

It is unlikely that resource constraints will lead to a phaseout of fossil fuels, and instead, such a phase-
out would require policy action. Around 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 20% of oil reserves are likely to 
remain unextractable under 2C constraints (McGlade and Ekins 2015; Pellegrini et al. 2020). Reserves 
are more likely to be utilized in a low-carbon transition if they can be paired with CCS. Availability of 
CCS technology not only allows continued use of fossil fuels as a capital resource for countries but also 
paves  the  way  for  CDR  through  BECCS  (Pye  et  al.  2020;  Haszeldine  2016).  While  the  theoretical 
geologic  CO2  sequestration  potential  is  vast,  there  are  limits  on  how  much  resource  base  could  be 
utilized based on geologic, engineering, and source-sink mapping criteria (Budinis et al. 2017). 

Technological  changes  have  continued  to  drive  down  fossil  fuel  extraction  costs.  Significant 
decarbonization potential also exists via diversification of the fossil fuel uses beyond combustion (high 
evidence). The costs of extracting oil and gas globally have gone down by utilizing hydraulic fracturing 
and  directional  drilling  for  resources  in  unconventional  reservoirs  (Wachtmeister  and  Höök  2020). 
Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional 
reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. 
The emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural 
gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et al. 2020). The increase in availability 
of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-
product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 
160%.  Natural  gas  liquids  could  potentially  be  a  lower-carbon  alternative  to  liquid  fuels  and 
hydrocarbons. On the demand side, natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen using steam methane 
reforming, which is a technologically mature process (Sections 6.4.4, 6.4.5). When combined with 90% 
CO2 capture, the costs of producing hydrogen are around USD 1.5–2 kg(H2)-1
 (Newborough and Cooley 
2020; Collodi et al. 2017), considerably less than hydrogen produced via electrolysis. 

Significant potential exists for gasifying deep-seated coal deposits in situ to produce hydrogen. Doing 
so  reduces  fugitive  methane  emissions  from  underground  coal mining.  The  integration costs  of  this 
process with CCS are less than with natural gas reforming. The extent to which coal gasification could 
be compatible with low-carbon energy would depend on the rate of CO2 capture and the ultimate use of 
the  gas  (Verma  and  Kumar  2015).  Similarly,  for  ongoing  underground  mining  projects,  coal  mine 
methane  recovery  can  be  economic  for  major  coal  producers  such  as  China  and  India.  Coal  mine 
methane and ventilation air methane recovery can reduce the fugitive methane emissions by 50–75% 
(Zhou et al. 2016; Singh and Sahu 2018).  

The cost of producing electricity from fossil sources has remained roughly the same with some regional 
exceptions while the costs of transport fuels has gone down significantly (high confidence). The cost of 
producing electricity from fossil fuels has remained largely static, with the exception of some regional 
changes, for example, a 40% cost reduction in the U.S. for natural gas (Rai et al. 2019), where the gas 
wellhead price has declined by almost two-thirds due to large reserves. Similarly, the global price of 
crude oil has declined from almost USD 100–55 bbl-1 in the last five years. 

The energy return of investment (EROI) is a useful indicator of full fossil lifecycle costs. Fossil fuels 
create significantly more energy per unit energy invested – or in other words have much larger EROI –
than most cleaner fuels such as biomass or electrolysis-derived hydrogen, where intensive processing 
reduces EROI (Hall et al. 2014). That said, recent years have seen a decrease in fossil EROI, especially 
as underground coal mining has continued in China. Exploitation of unconventional gas reservoirs is 
also energy intensive and has led to a reduction in EROI. The primary energy EROI of fossil fuels has 
converged at about 30, which represents a 20-point decrease from the 1995 value for coal (Brockway 
et al. 2019). When processing and refining stages are considered, these EROI values further decrease. 

Several countries have large reserves of fossil fuels. Owing to climate constraints, these may become 
stranded  causing  considerable  economic  impacts  (6.7.3,  6.7.4,  Box  6.13)  (high  confidence).  While 
global fossil energy resources are greater than 600 ZJ, more than half of these resources would likely

be unburnable even in the presence of CCS (Pye et al. 2020; McGlade and Ekins 2015). This would 
entail a significant capital loss for the countries with large reserves. The total amount of stranded assets 
in such a case would amount to USD 1–4 trillion at present value (Box 6.13).  

Apart from CO2 emissions and air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion, other environmental impacts 
include fugitive methane leakages and implications to water systems. While the rate of methane leakage 
from unconventional gas systems is uncertain, their overall GHG impact is less than coal (Deetjen and 
Azevedo 2020; Tanaka et al. 2019). The stated rate of leakage in such systems ranges from 1-8%, and 
reconciling different estimates requires a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches (Grubert 
and Brandt 2019; Zavala-Araiza et al. 2015). Similarly, for coal mining, fugitive methane emissions 
have  grown  despite  some  regulations  on  the  degree  to  which  emission  controls  must  be  deployed. 
Recent IPCC inventory guidance also notes considerable CO2 emissions resulting from spontaneous 
combustion of the coal surface, and accounting for these emissions will likely increase the overall life-
cycle emissions by 1–5% (Fiehn et al. 2020; Singh 2019; IPCC 2019).  

Another key issue consistently noted with unconventional wells (both oil and gas, and coalbed methane) 
is  the  large  water  requirements  (Qin  et  al.  2018).  The  overall  water  footprint  of  unconventional 
reservoirs  is  higher  than  conventional  reservoirs  because  of  higher  lateral  length  and  fracturing 
requirements  (Scanlon  et  al.  2017;  Kondash  et  al.  2018).  Moreover,  produced  water  from  such 
formations is moderately to highly brackish, and treating such waters has large energy consumption 
(Singh and Colosi 2019; Bartholomew and Mauter 2016).  

Oil  and  coal  consistently  rank  among  the  least  preferred  energy  sources  in  many  countries  (high 
confidence). The main perceived advantage of fossil energy is the relatively low costs, and emphasizing 
these costs might increase acceptability somewhat (Pohjolainen et al. 2018; Hazboun and Boudet 2020; 
Boyd et al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil fuels is on average similar to acceptability of nuclear energy, 
although evaluations are less polarized. People evaluate natural gas as somewhat more acceptable than 
other fossil fuels, although they generally oppose hydraulic fracturing (Clarke et al. 2016). Yet, natural 
gas is evaluated as less acceptable than renewable energy sources, although evaluations of natural gas 
and biogas are similar (Liebe and Dobers 2019; Plum et al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil energy tends 
to be higher in countries and regions that strongly rely on them for their energy production (Boyd et al. 
2019; Pohjolainen et al. 2018). Combining fossil fuels with CCS can increase their acceptability (Van 
Rijnsoever et al. 2015; Bessette and Arvai 2018). Some people seem ambivalent about natural gas, as 
they perceive both benefits (e.g., affordability, less carbon emissions than coal) and disadvantages (e.g., 
finite resource, contributing to climate change) (Blumer et al. 2018).  

Fossil fuel subsidies have been valued of the order of USD 0.5–5 trillion annually by various estimates 
which have the tendency to introduce economic inefficiency within systems (Merrill et al. 2015; Jakob 
et al. 2015) (high confidence). Subsequent reforms have been suggested by different researchers who 
have estimated reductions in CO2 emissions may take place if these subsidies are removed (Mundaca 
2017). Such reforms could create the necessary framework for enhanced investments in social welfare 
– through sanitation, water, clean energy - with differentiating impacts (Edenhofer 2015).   

6.4.2.8  Geothermal Energy 

Geothermal energy  is  heat  stored  in  the  Earth’s  subsurface  and  is a  renewable resource  that  can  be 
sustainably exploited. The geophysical potential of geothermal resources is 1.3 to 13 times the global 
electricity demand in 2019 (medium confidence). Geothermal energy can be used directly for various 
thermal  applications,  including  space  heating  and  industrial  heat  input,  or  converted  to  electricity 
depending on the source temperature (Moya et al. 2018; REN21 2019; Limberger et al. 2018).  

Suitable aquifers underlay 16% of the Earth's land surface and store an estimated 110,000–1,400,000 
PWh (400,000–1,450,000 EJ) that could theoretically be used for direct heat applications. For electricity 
generation, the technical potential of geothermal energy is estimated to be between 30 PWh yr-1 (108

EJ yr-1) (to 3 km depth) and 300 PWh yr-1 (1080 EJ yr-1) (to 10 km depth). For direct thermal uses, the 
technical potential is estimated to range from 2.7–86 PWh yr-1 (9.7–310 EJ yr-1)(IPCC 2011). Despite 
the potential, geothermal direct heat supplies only 0.15% of the annual global final energy consumption. 
The technical potential for electricity generation, depending on the depth, can meet one third to almost 
three times the global final consumption (based on IEA database for IPCC). The mismatch between 
potential  and  developed  geothermal  resources  is  caused  by  high  up-front  costs,  decentralized 
geothermal heat production, lack of uniformity among geothermal projects, geological uncertainties, 
and geotechnical risks (IRENA 2017a; Limberger et al. 2018). A limited number of countries have a 
long history in geothermal. At least in two countries (Iceland and New Zealand), geothermal accounts 
for  20–25%  of  electricity  generation  (Spittler  et  al.  2020;  Pan  et  al.  2019).  Furthermore,  in  Iceland 
approximately 90% of the households are heated with geothermal energy. In Kenya, as of July 2019, 
geothermal accounted for 734 MW effective capacity spread over 10 power plants and approximately 
one third of the total installed capacity (Kahlen 2019). 

Figure 6.15 Global weighted average total installed costs, capacity factors and LCOE for geothermal 
power per year (2010-2020). The shaded area represents the 5% and 95% percentiles. Source: (IRENA 
2021a) 

There are two main types of geothermal resources: convective hydrothermal resources, in which the 
Earth’s heat is carried by natural hot water or steam to the surface, and hot, dry rock resources, in which 
heat cannot be extracted using water or steam, and other methods must be developed. There are three 
basic  types  of  geothermal  power  plants:  (1)  dry  steam  plants  use  steam  directly  from  a  geothermal 
reservoir to turn generator turbines; (2) flash steam plants take high-pressure hot water from deep inside 
the Earth and convert it to steam to drive generator turbines and (3) binary cycle power plants transfer 
the heat from geothermal hot water to another liquid. Many of the power plants in operation today are 
dry steam plants or flash plants (single, double and triple) harnessing temperatures of more than 180°C.  

However, medium temperature fields are increasingly used for electricity generation or combined heat 
and power. The use of medium temperature fields has been enabled through the development of binary 
cycle technology, in which a geothermal fluid is used via heat exchangers. Increasing binary generation 
technologies are now being utilized instead of flash steam power plants. This will result in almost 100% 
injection  and  essentially  zero  GHG  emissions,  although  GHG  emissions  from  geothermal  power 
production  are  generally  small  compared  to  traditional  baseload  thermal  energy  power  generation 
facilities (Fridriksson et al. 2016).  

Additionally, new technologies are being developed like Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which 
is  in  the  demonstration  stage  (IRENA  2018),  deep  geothermal  technology,  which  may  increase  the 
prospects for harnessing the geothermal potential in a large number of countries, or shallow-geothermal 
energy, which represents a promising supply source for heating and cooling buildings (Narsilio and Aye 
2018). Successful large-scale deployment of shallow geothermal energy will depend not only on site-
specific economic performance but also on developing suitable governance frameworks (Bloemendal

et al. 2018; García-Gil et al. 2020). Technologies for direct uses like district heating, geothermal heat 
pumps, greenhouses, and other applications are widely used and considered mature. Given the limited 
number of plants commissioned, economic indicators (Figure 6.15) vary considerably depending on site 
characteristics. 

Public awareness and knowledge of geothermal energy is relatively low (high confidence). Geothermal 
energy is evaluated as less acceptable than other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, but 
is preferred over fossil and nuclear energy, and in some studies, over hydroelectric energy (Karytsas et 
al. 2019; Pellizzone et al. 2015; Steel et al. 2015; Hazboun and Boudet 2020) (high confidence). Some 
people are concerned about the installation of geothermal facilities close to their homes, similar to solar 
and wind projects (Pellizzone et al. 2015). The main concerns about geothermal energy, particularly for 
large scale, high-temperature geothermal power generation plants, involve water usage, water scarcity, 
and seismic risks of drilling (Dowd et al. 2011). Moreover, noise, smell and damages to the landscape 
have  been  reasons  for  protests  against  specific  projects  (Walker  1995).  However,  with  the 
implementation of modern technologies, geothermal presents fewer adverse environmental impacts. At 
the same time, people perceive geothermal energy as relatively environmentally friendly (Tampakis et 
al. 2013).   

6.4.2.9  Marine Energy 

The ocean is a vast source of energy (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). Ocean energy can be extracted from 
tides, waves, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), currents, and salinity gradients (Bindoff et al. 
2019). Their technical potentials, without considering possible exclusion zones, are explored below. 
Tidal  energy,  which  uses  elevation  differences  between  high  and  low  tides,  appears  in  two  forms: 
potential energy (rise and fall of the tide) and current energy (from tidal currents). The global technically 
harvestable tidal power from areas close to the coast is estimated as ~1.2 PWh yr-1 (4.3 EJ yr-1) (IRENA 
2020b). The potential for tidal current energy is estimated to be larger than that for tidal range or barrage 
(Melikoglu 2018). Ocean wave energy is abundant and predictable and can be extracted directly from 
surface  waves  or  pressure  fluctuations  below  the  surface  (Melikoglu  2018).  Its  global  theoretical 
potential is 29.5 PWh yr-1 (106 EJ yr-1) ,which means that wave energy alone could meet all global 
energy  demand  (Mørk  et  al.  2010;  IRENA  2020b).  The  temperature  gradients  in  the  ocean  can  be 
exploited to produce energy, and its total estimated available resource could be up to 44.0 PWh yr-1 
(158 EJ yr-1) (Rajagopalan and Nihous 2013). Salinity gradient energy, also known as osmotic power, 
has  a  global  theoretical  potential  of  over  1.6  PWh  yr-1  (6.0  EJ  yr-1)  (IRENA  2020b).  The  greatest 
advantage of most marine energy, excluding wave energy, is that their sources are highly regular and 
predictable, and energy can be furthermore generated both day and night. An additional use of sea water 
is to develop lower-cost district cooling systems near the sea (Hunt et al. 2019). The greatest barrier to 
most marine  technology  advances is the relatively high  upfront  costs,  uncertainty  on  environmental 
regulation and impact, need for investments and insufficient infrastructure (Kempener and Neumann 
2014a,b). There are also concerns about technology maturity and performance; thus, not all have the 
potential to become economically viable (IRENA 2020b).  

6.4.2.10  Waste-to-Energy  

Waste-to-energy  (WTE)  is  a  strategy  to  recover  energy  from  waste  in  a  form  of  consumable  heat, 
electricity, or fuel (Zhao et al. 2016). Thermal (incineration, gasification, and pyrolysis) and biological 
(anaerobic  digestion  and  landfill  gas  to  energy)  technologies  are  commonly  used  (Ahmad  et  al. 
2020).When  WTE  technologies  are  equipped  with  proper  air  pollution  reduction  facilities  they  can 
contribute to clean electricity production and reduction of GHG emissions. However, if not properly 
operated, they can exacerbate air quality issues. 

In 2019, there were more than 1,200 WTE incineration facilities worldwide, with estimated capacity of 
310 million tons per year (UNECE 2020). It is estimated that treatment of a minimum of 261 million

tons/year of waste could produce 283 TWh (1 EJ) of power and heat by 2022 (Awasthi et al., 2019). 
Incineration plants can reduce the mass of waste by 70%-80% and the volume of waste by 80%-90% 
(Haraguchi et al. 2019). Incineration technology can reduce water and soil pollution (Gu et al., 2019). 
However, if not properly handled, dust, and gases such as SO2, HCL, HF, NO2, and dioxins in the flue 
gases  can  harm  the  environment  (Mutz  et  al.  2017).  Anaerobic  digestion  technology  has  a  positive 
environmental  impact  and  the  ability  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  (Ayodele  et  al.  2018;  Cudjoe  et  al. 
2020).  The by-product of the anaerobic digestion process could be used as a nutrient-rich fertilizer for 
enhancing soil richness for agricultural purposes (Wainaina et al. 2020). Due to the potential negative 
impacts on domestic environment and residents’ health, WTE projects such as incineration encounter 
substantial opposition from the local communities in which they are located (Ren et al., 2016; Baxter 
et al., 2016). Therefore, for WTE to be deployed more widely, policies would need to be tailored with 
specific guidelines focused on mitigating emissions, which may have adverse effect on the environment. 

Depending on the origin of the waste used, the integration of WTE and carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) could enable waste to be a net zero or even net negative emissions energy source (Kearns 2019; 
Wienchol et al. 2020). For example, in Europe only, the integration of CCS with WTE facilities has the 
potential to capture about 60 to 70 million tons of carbon dioxide annually (Tota et al. 2021).  

Waste-to-energy is  an expensive  process  compared to  other  energy sources such  as  fossil fuels  and 
natural gas (Mohammadi and Harjunkoski 2020). However, the environmental and economic benefits 
make its high financial costs justifiable. In 2019, the global WTE market size was valued at USD 31 
billion, and it is predicted to experience 7.4% annual growth until 2027 (UNECE 2020). 

6.4.3  Energy System Integration 

Greenhouse gases are emitted across all economic activities. Therefore, cost-effective decarbonization 
requires a “system of systems” approach that considers the interaction between different energy sectors 
and  systems.  Flexibility  technologies  and  advanced  control  of  integrated  energy  systems  (e.g., 
considering the interaction between electricity, heating/cooling, gas/hydrogen, transport sectors) could 
reduce energy infrastructure investments substantially in future low-carbon energy systems (Strbac et 
al. 2015b; Jacobson et al. 2019) 

The electricity grid will serve as a backbone of future low-carbon energy systems. Integration of large 
amounts of VRE generation (Hansen et al. 2019), particularly wind and solar generation (Perez et al. 
2019;  Bistline  and  Young  2019),  presents  economic  and  technical  challenges  to  electricity  system 
management  across  different  timescales  from  sub-seconds,  hours,  days,  seasons,  to  multiple  years. 
Furthermore,  electrification  of  segments  of  the  transport  and  heat  sectors  could  disproportionately 
increase peak demand relative to supply (Bistline et al. 2021). Increases in peak demand may require 
reinforcing network infrastructures and generation in the historical passive system operation paradigm 
(Strbac et al. 2020).  

These challenges to electricity system management can be addressed through system integration and a 
digitalized control paradigm involving advanced information and communication technologies. Real-
time maintenance of supply-demand balance and sufficient flexibility technologies such as electricity 
storage, flexible demand, and grid forming converters (Strbac et al. 2015a; López Prol and Schill 2021) 
would be increasingly valuable for incorporating larger amounts of VRE generation. This flexibility 
will be particularly important to deal with sudden losses of supply, for example, due to a failure of a 
large generator or interconnector or a rapid increase in demand (Teng et al. 2017; Chamorro et al. 2020).  

The transition to a digitalized-based electricity system control paradigm would facilitate radical changes 
in the security of supply, moving from the traditional approach of redundancy in assets to a smart control

paradigm. Advanced control and communication systems can significantly reduce the electricity system 
investment and operation costs (2020; Münster et al. 2020; Harper et al. 2018). 

Importance of cross-sector coupling for cost-effective energy system decarbonization 

Integrated whole-system approaches can reduce the costs of low-carbon energy system transitions (high 
confidence). A lack of flexibility in the electricity system may limit the cost-effective integration of 
technologies  as  part  of  broader  net  zero  energy  systems.  At  the  same  time,  the  enormous  latent 
flexibility hidden in heating and cooling, hydrogen, transport, gas systems, and other energy systems 
provides  opportunities  to  take  advantage  of  synergies  and  to  coordinate  operations  across  systems 
(Martinez Cesena and Mancarella 2019; Zhang et al. 2018; Bogdanov et al. 2021; Pavičević et al. 2020; 
Martin et al. 2017) (Figure 6.16).  

Sector  coupling  can  significantly  increase  system  flexibility,  driven  by  the  application  of  advanced 
technologies  (Bogdanov  et  al.  2019;  Solomon  et  al.  2019;  Clegg  and  Mancarella  2016;  Zhang  and 
Fujimori 2020; Zhao et al. 2021; Heinen et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2019b). For example, district heating 
infrastructure can generate both heat and power. Cooling systems and electrified heating systems in 
buildings can provide flexibility through preheating and precooling via thermal energy storage  Li, G. 
et al. 2017; Li, Z. et al. 2016).. System balancing services can be provided by electric vehicles (EVs) 
based on vehicle-to-grid concepts and deferred charging through smart control of EV batteries without 
compromising customers’ requirements for transport (Aunedi and Strbac 2020). 

Hydrogen production processes (power-to-gas and vice versa) and hydrogen storage can support short-
term and long-term balancing in the energy systems and enhance resilience (Stephen and Pierluigi 2016; 
Strbac et al. 2020). However, the economic benefits of flexible power-to-gas plants, energy storage, 
and other flexibility technological and options will depend on the locations of VRE sources, storage 
sites, gas, hydrogen, and electricity networks (Jentsch et al. 2014; Heymann and Bessa 2015; Ameli et 
al.  2020).  Coordinated  operation  of  gas  and  electricity  systems  can  bring  significant  benefits  in 
supplying  heat  demands.  For  example,  hybrid  heating  can  eliminate  investment  in  electricity 
infrastructure reinforcement by switching to heat pumps in off-peak hours and gas boilers in peak hours 
( Dengiz et al. 2019; Fischer et al. 2017; Bistline et al. 2021). The heat required by direct air carbon 
capture and storage (DACCS) could be effectively supplied by inherent heat energy in nuclear plants, 
enhancing overall system efficiency (Realmonte et al. 2019).

Rather  than  incremental  planning,  strategic  energy  system  planning  can  help  minimize  long-term 
mitigation costs (high confidence). With a whole-system perspective, integrated planning can consider 
both  short-term  operation  and  long-term  investment  decisions,  covering  infrastructure  from  local  to 
national  and  international,  while  meeting  security  of  supply  requirements  and  incorporating  the

flexibility  provided  by  different  technologies  and  advanced  control  strategies  (Zhang  et  al.  2018; 
O’Malley et al. 2020; Strbac et al. 2020). Management of conflicts and synergies between local district 
and national level energy system objectives, including strategic investment in local hydrogen and heat 
infrastructure, can drive significant whole-system cost savings (Fu et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2019b). For 
example, long-term planning of the offshore grid infrastructure to support offshore wind development, 
including  interconnection  between  different  countries  and  regions,  can  provide  significant  savings 
compared  to  a  short-term  incremental  approach  in  which  every  offshore  wind  farm  is  individually 
connected to the onshore grid (E3G 2021). 

6.4.3.1  Role of flexibility technologies  

Flexibility  technologies  -  including  energy  storage,  demand-side  response,  flexible/dispatchable 
generation,  grid forming  converters, and  transmission  interconnection  -  as  well  as  advanced  control 
systems,  can  facilitate  cost-effective  and  secure  low-carbon  energy  systems  (high  confidence). 
Flexibility technologies have already been implemented, but they can be enhanced and deployed more 
widely. Due to their interdependencies and similarities, there can be both synergies and conflicts for 
utilizing these flexibility options (Bistline et al. 2021). It will therefore be important to coordinate the 
deployment of the potential flexibility technologies and smart control strategies. Important electricity 
system flexibility options include the following: 

•  Flexible/dispatchable generation: Advances in generation technologies, for example, gas/hydrogen 
plants and nuclear plants, can enable them to provide flexibility services. These technologies would 
start more quickly, operate at lower power output, and make faster output changes, enabling more 
secure  and  cost-effective  integration  of  VRE  generation  and  end-use  electrification.  There  are 
already important developments in increasing nuclear plants flexibility (e.g., in France (Office of 
Nuclear Energy 2021)) and the development of small modular reactors, which could support system 
balancing (FTI Consulting 2018).  

•  Grid-forming  converters  (inverters):  The  transition  from  conventional  electricity  generation, 
applying  mainly  synchronous  machines  to  inverter-dominated  renewable  generation,  creates 
significant operating challenges. These challenges are mainly associated with reduced synchronous 
inertia, system stability, and black start capability. Grid-forming converters will be a cornerstone 
for the control of future electricity systems dominated by VRE generation. These converters will 
address  critical  stability  challenges,  including  the  lack  of  system  inertia,  frequency  and  voltage 
regulation, and black-start services while reducing or eliminating the need to operate conventional 
generation (Tayyebi et al. 2019).  
Interconnection:  Electricity  interconnections  between  different  regions  can  facilitate  more  cost-
effective  renewable  electricity  deployment.  Interconnection  can  enable  large-scale  sharing  of 
energy  and  provide  balancing  services.  Back-up  energy  carriers  beyond  electricity,  such  as 
ammonia,  can  be  shared  through  gas/ammonia/hydrogen-based  interconnections,  strengthening 
temporal coupling of multiple sectors in different regions (Bhagwat et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2018) 
(Section 6.4.5).  

• 

•  Demand-side response: Demand-side schemes  – including, for example, smart appliances, EVs, 
and building-based thermal energy storage (Heleno et al. 2014) – can provide flexibility services 
across  multiple  time  frames  and  systems.  Through  differentiation  between  essential  and  non-
essential needs during emergency conditions, smart control of demands can significantly enhance 
system resilience (Chaffey 2016). 

•  Energy storage: Energy storage technologies (Section 6.4.4) can act as both demand and generation 
sources.  They  can  provide  services  such  as  system  balancing,  various  ancillary  services,  and 
network  management.  Long-duration  energy  storage can  significantly  enhance the  utilization  of 
renewable energy sources and reduce the need for  firm low-carbon generation (Sepulveda et al. 
2021).

A digitalized energy system can significantly reduce energy infrastructure investments while enhancing 
supply security and resilience (high confidence) (Andoni et al. 2019; Strbac et al. 2020). Significant 
progress has been made in the development of technologies essential for the transition to a digitalized 
energy control paradigm, although the full implementation is still under development. Electrification 
and the increased integration of the electricity system with other systems will fundamentally transform 
the  operational  and  planning  paradigm  of  future  energy  infrastructure.  A  fully  intelligent  and 
sophisticated  coordination of the  multiple  systems  through  smart  control  will  support this  paradigm 
shift.  This  shift  will  provide  significant  savings  through  better  utilization  of  existing  infrastructure 
locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. Supply system reliability will be enhanced through 
advanced control of local infrastructure (Strbac et al. 2015a). Furthermore, this paradigm shift offers 
the potential to increase energy efficiency through a combination of technologies that gather and analyse 
data and consequently optimize energy use in real-time. 

The transition to advanced data-driven control of energy system operations (Sun et al. 2019a; Cremer 
et  al.  2019)  will  require  advanced  information  and  communication  technologies  and  infrastructure, 
including the internet, wireless networks, computers, software, middleware, smart sensors, internet of 
things  components,  and  dedicated  technological  developments  (Hossein  Motlagh  et  al.  2020).  The 
transition  will  raise  standardization and cybersecurity  issues,  given that  digitalization  can  become  a 
single  point  of  failure  for  the  complete  system  (Unsal  et  al.  2021;  Ustun  and  Hussain  2019). 
Implementing peer-to-peer energy trading based on blockchain is expected to be one of the key elements 
of next-generation electricity systems (Qiu et al. 2021). This trading will enable consumers to drive 
system operation and future design, increasing overall system efficiency and security of supply while 
reducing  emissions  without  sacrificing  users’  privacy  (Andoni  et  al.  2019;  Ahl  et  al.  2020).  When 
deployed  with  smart  contracts,  this  concept  will  be  suitable  for  energy  systems  involving  many 
participants, where a prerequisite is digitalization (e.g., smart meters, end-use demand control systems) 
(Teufel et al. 2019; Juhar and Khaled 2018). 

6.4.3.3  System benefits of flexibility technologies and advanced control systems 

New sources of flexibility and advanced control systems provide a significant opportunity to reduce 
low-carbon energy system costs by enhancing operating efficiency and reducing energy infrastructure 
and  low-carbon  generation  investments,  while  continuing  to  meet  security  requirements  (high 
confidence). In the U.S, for example, one study found that flexibility in buildings alone could reduce 
U.S.  CO2  emissions  by  80  MT  yr-1  and  save  USD  18  bn  yr-1  in  electricity  system  costs  by  2030 
(Satchwell et al. 2021). Key means for creating savings are associated with the following: 

•  Efficient energy system operation: Flexibility technologies such as storage, demand-side response, 
interconnection, and cross-system control will enable more efficient, real-time demand and supply 
balancing.  This  balancing  has  historically  been  provided  by  conventional  fossil-fuel  generation 
(Nuytten et al. 2013). 

•  Savings in investment in low carbon/renewable generation capacity: System flexibility sources can 
absorb or export surplus electricity, thus reducing or avoiding energy curtailment and reducing the 
need for firm low-carbon capacity such as nuclear and fossil-fuel plants with CCS (Newbery et al. 
2013;  Solomon  et  al.  2019).  For  example,  one  study  found  that  flexibility  technologies  and 
advanced control systems could reduce the need for nuclear power by 14 GW and offshore wind by 
20 GW in the UK’s low-carbon transition (Strbac et al. 2015b). 

•  Reduced need for backup capacity: System flexibility can reduce energy demand peaks, reducing 
the required generation capacity to maintain the security of supply, producing significant savings 
in generation investments (Strbac et al. 2020).  

•  Deferral  or  avoidance  of  electricity  network  reinforcement/addition:  Flexibility  technologies 
supported by advanced control systems can provide significant savings in investment in electricity

network  reinforcement  that  might  emerge  from  increased  demand,  for  example,  driven  by 
electrification of transport and heat sectors. Historical network planning and operation standards 
are being revised considering alternative flexibility technologies, which would further support cost-
effective integration of decarbonized transport and heat sectors (Strbac et al. 2020). 

6.4.4  Energy Storage for Low-Carbon Grids  

Energy storage technologies make low carbon electricity systems more cost-effective, allowing VRE 
technologies to replace more expensive firm low carbon generation technologies (Carbon Trust 2016) 
and  reducing  investment  costs  in  backup  generation,  interconnection,  transmission,  and  distribution 
network upgrades (high confidence). Energy system decarbonization relies on increased electrification 
(Section 6.6.2.3.). Meeting increasing demands with variable renewable sources presents challenges 
and could lead to costly infrastructure reinforcements. Energy storage enables electricity from variable 
renewables to be matched against evolving demands across both time and space, using short-, medium- 
and long-term storage of excess energy for delivery later or different location. In 2017, an estimated 
4.67 TWh (0.017 EJ) of electricity storage was in operation globally (IRENA 2017). If the integration 
of renewables is doubled from 2014 levels by 2030, the total capacity of global electricity storage could 
triple, reaching 11.89–15.27 TWh (0.043–0.055 EJ)(IRENA 2017b).

Energy storage technologies can provide a range of different grid services (Table 6.5). Energy storage 
enhances  security  of  supply  by  providing  real  time  system  regulation  services  (voltage  support, 
frequency regulation, fast reserve, and short-term reserve). A greater proportion of variable renewable 
sources reduces system inertia, requiring more urgent responses to changes in system frequency, which 
rapid  response  storage  technologies  can  provide  (stability  requires  responses  within  sub  second 
timescale  for  provision  of  frequency  and  voltage  control  services).  Energy  storage  also  provides 
intermittent  renewable  sources  with  flexibility,  allowing  them  to  contribute  a  greater  proportion  of 
electrical energy and avoiding curtailment (capacity firming). Investment costs in backup generation, 
interconnection,  transmission,  and  distribution  network  upgrades  can  thus  be  reduced  (upgrade 
deferral), meaning that less low carbon generation will need to be built while still reducing emissions. 
In the event of an outage, energy storage reserves can keep critical services running (islanding) and 
restart  the  grid  (black start).  The  ability to  store  and release  energy as required provides  a  range  of 
market opportunities for buying and selling of energy (arbitrage). 

No single, sufficiently mature energy storage technology can provide all the required grid services - a 
portfolio  of  complementary  technologies  working  together  can  provide  the  optimum  solution  (high 
confidence). Different energy storage technologies can provide these services and support cost-effective 
energy system decarbonization (Carbon Trust 2016). To achieve very low carbon systems, significant 
volumes of storage will be required (Strbac et al. 2015a; Section 0). There are few mature global supply 
chains  for  many  of  the  less-developed  energy  storage  technologies.  This  means  that  although  costs 
today may be relatively high, there are significant opportunities for future cost reductions, both through 
technology innovation and through manufacturing scale. Adding significant amounts of storage will 
reduce the price variation and, therefore, the profitability of additional and existing storage, increasing 
investment risk.  

Energy storage extends beyond electricity storage and includes technologies that can store energy as 
heat,  cold,  and  both  liquid  and  gaseous  fuels.  Energy  storage  is  a  conversion  technology,  enabling 
energy to be converted from one form to another. This diversification improves the overall resilience 
of energy systems, with each system being able to cover supply shortfalls in the others. For example, 
storage  can  support  the  electrification  of  heating  or  cooling,  as  well  as  transport  through  electric 
vehicles,  powered  by  batteries  or  by  fuel  cells.  Storage  significantly  reduces  the  need  for  costly 
reinforcement of local distribution networks through smart charging schemes and the ability to flow 
electricity  back  to  the  grid  (e.g.,  through  vehicle-to-grid).  By  capturing  otherwise  wasted  energy 
streams,  such  as  heat  or  cold,  energy  storage  improves  the  efficiency  of  many  systems,  such  as 
buildings, data centres and industrial processes. 

6.4.4.1  Energy Storage Technologies 

Pumped Hydroelectric Storage (PHS). PHS makes use of gravitational potential energy, using water as 
the medium. Water is pumped into an elevated reservoir using off-peak electricity and stored for later 
release when electricity is needed. These closed-loop hydropower plants have been in use for decades 
and account for 97% of worldwide electricity storage capacity (IEA, 2018b; IRENA, 2017). PHS is best 
suited to balancing daily energy needs at a large scale, and advances in the technology now allow both 
rapid response and power regulation in both generating and pumping mode (Valavi and Nysveen 2018; 
Kougias  et  al.  2019;  Dong  et  al.  2019).  The  construction  itself  can  cause  disruption  to  the  local 
community  and  environment  (Hayes  et  al.  2019),  the  initial  investment  is  costly,  and  extended

construction periods delay return on investment (Section 6.4.2.3). In addition, locations for large-scale 
PHS plants are limited. 

Advanced pump-turbines are being developed, allowing both reversible and variable-speed operation, 
supporting frequency control and grid stability with improved round-trip efficiencies (Ardizzon et al. 
2014).  New  possibilities  are  being  explored  for  small-scale  PHS  installations  and  expanding  the 
potential for siting (Kougias et al. 2019). For example, in underwater PHS, the upper reservoir is the 
sea, and the lower is a hollow deposit at the seabed. Seawater is pumped out of the deposit to store off-
peak energy and re-enters through turbines to recharge it (Kougias et al. 2019). Using a similar concept, 
underground  siting  in  abandoned  mines  and  caverns  could  be  developed  reasonably  quickly  (IEA 
2020h). Storage of energy as gravitational potential can also be implemented using materials other than 
water, such as rocks and sand. Pumped technology is a mature technology (Barbour et al. 2016; Rehman 
et al. 2015) and can be important in supporting the transition to future low carbon electricity grids (IHA 
2021). 

Batteries. There are many types of batteries, all having unique features and suitability (c), but their key 
feature is their rapid response times. A rechargeable battery cell is charged by using electricity to drive 
ions from one electrode to another, with the reverse occurring on discharge, producing a usable electric 
current (Crabtree et al. 2015). While lead-acid batteries (LABs) have been widely used for automotive 
and grid applications for decades (May et al. 2018), li-ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly being used 
in  grid-scale  projects  (Crabtree  et  al.  2015),  displacing  LABs.  The  rapid  response  time  of  batteries 
makes them suitable for enhanced frequency regulation and voltage support, enabling the integration of 
variable renewables into electricity grids (Strbac and Aunedi 2016). Batteries can provide almost all 
electricity services, except for seasonal storage. Lithium-ion batteries, in particular, can store energy 
and power in small volumes and with low weight, making them the default choice for EVs (Placke et 
al. 2017). EV batteries are expected to form a distributed storage resource as this market grows, both 
impacting and supporting the grid (Staffell and Rustomji 2016).

precede LIBs (white background), LIBs (yellow background) and post LIBs (blue background). With the 
exception of the All Solid-State batteries, all use liquid electrolytes. (1 =Mahmoudzadeh et al. 2017; 2 =

Drawbacks of batteries include relatively short lifespans and the use of hazardous or costly materials in 
some variants. While LIB costs are decreasing (Schmidt et al. 2017; Vartiainen et al. 2020), the risk of 
thermal runaway, which could ignite a fire (Gur 2018; Wang et al. 2019a), concerns about long-term 
resource availability (Sun et al. 2017; Olivetti et al. 2017), and concerns about global cradle-to-grave 
impacts (Peters et al. 2017; Kallitsis et al. 2020) need to be addressed. 

The superior characteristics of LIBs will keep them the dominant choice for EV and grid applications 
in the medium-term (high confidence). There are, however, several next-generation battery chemistries 
(Placke et al. 2017), which show promise (high confidence). Cost reductions through economies of scale 
are  a  key  area  for  development.  Extending  the  life  of  the  battery  can  bring  down  overall  costs  and 
mitigate  the  environmental  impacts  (Peters  et  al.  2017).  Understanding  and  controlling  battery 
degradation is therefore important. The liquid, air-reactive electrolytes of conventional LIBs are the 
main source of their safety issues (Gur 2018; Janek and Zeier 2016), so All-Solid-State Batteries, in 
which the electrolyte is a solid, stable material, are being developed. They are expected to be safe, be 
durable, and have higher energy densities (Janek and Zeier 2016). New chemistries and concepts are 
being explored, such as lithium-sulfur batteries to achieve even higher energy densities (Van Noorden 
2014; Blomgren 2017) and sodium chemistries because sodium is more abundant than lithium (Hwang 
et al. 2017). Cost-effective recycling of batteries will address many sustainability issues and prevent 
hazardous and wasteful disposal of used batteries (Harper et al. 2019). Post-LIB chemistries include 
metal sulfur, metal-air, metal ion (besides Li) and All-Solid-State Batteries. 

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). With CAES, off-peak electricity is used to compress air in a 
reservoir – either in salt caverns for large scale or in high-pressure tanks for smaller-scale installations. 
The air is later released to generate electricity. While conventional CAES has used natural gas to power 
compression,  new  low  carbon  CAES  technologies,  such  as  isothermal  or  adiabatic  CAES,  control 
thermal  losses  during  compression  and  expansion  (Wang  et  al.  2017c).  Fast  responses  and  higher 
efficiencies  occur  in  small-scale  CAES  installations, scalable to suit the  application  as  a  distributed 
energy store, offering a flexible, low maintenance alternative  (Luo et al. 2014; Venkataramani et al. 
2016). 

CAES  is  a  mature  technology  in  use  since  the  1970s.  Although  CAES  technologies  have  been 
developed, there are not many installations at present (Blanc et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2017b). While the 
opportunities  for  CAES  are  significant,  with  a  global  geological  storage  potential  of  about  6.5  PW 
(Aghahosseini  and  Breyer  2018),  a  significant  amount  of  initial  investment  is  required.  Higher 
efficiencies and energy densities can be achieved by exploiting the hydrostatic pressure of deep water 
to compress air within submersible reservoirs (Pimm et al. 2014). CAES is best suited to bulk diurnal 
electricity storage for buffering VRE sources and services, which do not need a very rapid response. In 
contrast to PHS, CAES has far more siting options and poses few environmental impacts. 

Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES). Liquid air energy storage uses electricity to liquefy air by cooling 
it to –196°C and storing it in this condensed form (largely liquid nitrogen) in large, insulated tanks. To 
release electricity, the ‘liquid air’ is evaporated through heating, expanding to drive gas turbines. Low-
grade waste heat can be utilized, providing opportunities  for integrating with industrial processes to 
increase  system  efficiency.  There  are  clear,  exploitable  synergies  with  the  existing  liquid  gas 
infrastructure (Peters and Sievert 2016).

LAES provides bulk daily storage of electricity, with the additional advantage of being able to capture 
waste heat from industrial processes. This technology is in the early commercial stage (Regen 2017; 
Brandon et al. 2015). Advances in whole systems integration can be developed to integrate LAES with 
industrial processes, making use of their waste heat streams. LAES uniquely removes contaminants in 
the air and could potentially incorporate CO2 capture (Taylor et al. 2012).  

Thermal Energy Storage (TES). Thermal energy storage refers to a range of technologies exploiting the 
ability of materials to absorb and store heat or cold, either within the same phase (sensible TES), through 
phase changes (latent TES), or through reversible chemical reactions (thermochemical TES). Pumped 
Thermal Energy Storage (PTES), a hybrid form of TES, is an air-driven electricity storage technology 
storing  both  heat  and  cold  in  gravel  beds,  using  a  reversible  heat-pump  system  to  maintain  the 
temperature difference between the two beds and gas compression to generate and transfer heat (Regen 
2017).  TES  technologies  can  store  both  heat  and  cold  energy  for  long  periods,  for  example  in 
underground water reservoirs for balancing between seasons  (Tian et al. 2019; Dahash et al. 2019), 
storing heat and cold to balance daily and seasonal temperatures in buildings and reducing heat build-
up in applications generating excessive waste heat, such as data centres and underground operations. 

TES can be much cheaper than batteries and has the unique ability to capture and reuse waste heat and 
cold,  enabling  the  efficiency  of  many  industrial,  buildings,  and  domestic  processes  to  be  greatly 
improved (high confidence). Integration of TES into energy systems is particularly important, as the 
global demand for cooling is expected to grow (Peters and Sievert 2016; Elzinga et al. 2014). Sensible 
TES  is  well  developed  and  widely  used;  latent  TES  is  less  developed  with  few  applications. 
Thermochemical TES is the least developed, with no application yet  (Prieto et al. 2016; Clark et al. 
2020). The potential for high-density storage of industrial heat for long periods in thermochemical TES 
(Brandon et al. 2015) is high, with energy densities comparable to that of batteries (Taylor et al. 2012), 
but material costs are currently prohibitive, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars per tonne.  

Flywheel  Energy  Storage  (FES).  Flywheels  are  charged  by  accelerating  a  rotor/flywheel.  Energy  is 
stored  in  the  spinning  rotor’s  inertia  which  is  only  decelerated  by  friction  (minimized  by  magnetic 
bearings in a vacuum), or by contact with a mechanical, electric motor. They can reach full charge very 
rapidly, their state of charge can be easily determined (Amiryar and Pullen 2017), and they operate over 
a  wide  range  of  temperatures.  While  they  are  more  expensive  to  install  than  batteries  and 
supercapacitors, they last a long time and are best suited to stationary grid storage, providing high power 
for short periods (minutes). Flywheels can be used in vehicles, but not as the primary energy source. 

Flywheels are a relatively mature storage technology but not widely used, despite their many advantages 
over  electrochemical  storage  (Dragoni  2017).  Conventional  flywheels  require  costly,  high  tensile 
strength materials, but high-energy flywheels, using lightweight rotor materials, are being developed 
(Amiryar and Pullen 2017; Hedlund et al. 2015).  

Supercapacitors, aka Ultracapacitors or Double Layer Capacitors (Scap). Supercapacitors consist of a 
porous  separator  sandwiched  between  two  electrodes,  immersed  in  a  liquid  electrolyte  (Gur  2018). 
When a voltage is applied across the electrodes, ions in the electrolyte form electric double layers at the 
electrode surfaces, held by electrostatic forces. This structure forms a capacitor, storing electrical charge 
(Lin et al. 2017; Brandon et al. 2015) and can operate from –40°C to 65°C. 

Supercapacitors can supply high peaks of power very rapidly for short periods (seconds up to minutes) 
and  are  able  to  fulfil  the  grid  requirements  for  frequency  regulation,  but  they  would  need  to  be 
hybridized  with  batteries  for  automotive  applications.  Their  commercial  status  is  limited  by  costly 
materials  and  additional  power  electronics  required  to  stabilize  their  output  (Brandon  et  al.  2015). 
Progress  in  this  area  includes  the  development  of  high  energy  supercapacitors,  LIB-supercapacitor 
devices (Gonzalez et al. 2016), and cheaper materials (Wang et al. 2017a), all providing the potential

to improve the economic case for supercapacitors, either by reducing manufacturing costs or extending 
their service portfolio.  

Redox  Flow  Batteries  (RFB).  Redox  flow  batteries  use  two  separate  electrolyte  solutions,  usually 
liquids, but solid or gaseous forms may also be involved, stored in separate tanks, and pumped over or 
through electrode stacks during charge and discharge, with an ion-conducting membrane separating the 
liquids. The larger the tank, the greater the energy storage capacity, whereas more and larger cells in 
the stack increase the power of the flow battery. This decoupling of energy from power enables RFB 
installations to be uniquely tailored to  suit the requirements of any given application. There are two 
commercially  available  types  today:  vanadium  and  zinc  bromide,  and  both  operate  at  near  ambient 
temperatures, incurring minimal operational costs.  

RFBs respond rapidly and can perform all the same services as LIBs, except for onboard electricity for 
EVs. Lower cost chemistries are emerging, to enable cost-effective bulk energy storage (Brandon et al. 
2015). A new membrane-free design eliminates the need for a separator and also halves the system 
requirements, as the chemical reactions can coexist in a single electrolyte solution  (Navalpotro et al. 
2017; Arenas et al. 2018).  

Power to fuels (PtX). (see also Section 6.4.3.1) The process of using electricity to generate a gaseous 
fuel, such as hydrogen or ammonia, is termed power-to-gas (PtG/P2G) (IEA 2020h). When injected 
into  the  existing  gas  infrastructure  (section  6.4.5),  it  has  the  added  benefit  of  decarbonizing  gas 
(Brandon et al. 2015). Electricity can be used to generate hydrogen, which is then converted back into 
electricity using combined-cycle gas turbines that have been converted to run on hydrogen. For greater 
compatibility  with  existing  gas  systems  and  appliances,  the  hydrogen  can  combined  with  captured 
carbon dioxide to form methane and other synthetic fuels (Thema et al. 2019), however methane has 
high  global  warming  potential  and  its  supply  chain  emissions  have  been  found  to  be  significant 
(Balcombe et al. 2013). 

PtX can provide all required grid services, depending on how it is integrated. However, a significant 
amount of PtX is required for storage to produce electricity again (Bogdanov et al. 2019) due to the low 
roundtrip efficiency of converting electricity to fuel and back again. However,  portable fuels (hydrogen, 
methane, ammonia, synthetic hydrocarbons) are useful in certain applications, for example in energy 
systems  lacking  the  potential  for  renewables,  and  the  high  energy  density  of  chemical  storage  is 
essential for more demanding applications, such as transporting heavy goods and heating or cooling 
buildings (IEA 2020h). Research into more efficient and flexible electrolyzers which last longer and 
cost less is needed (Brandon et al. 2015). 

Hydrogen and Reversible Hydrogen Fuel Cells (H/RHFC). Hydrogen is a flexible fuel with diverse 
uses,  capable  of  providing  electricity,  heat,  and  long-term  energy  storage  for  grids,  industry,  and 
transport, and has been widely used industrially for decades (Section 0). Hydrogen can be produced in 
various ways and stored in significant quantities in geological formations at moderate pressures, often 
for  long  periods,  providing  seasonal  storage  (Gabrielli  et  al.  2020).  A  core  and  emerging 
implementation of PtX is hydrogen production through electrolyzers. Hydrogen is a carbon-free fuel 
holding three times the energy held by an equivalent mass of gasoline but occupying a larger volume. 
An electrolyzer uses excess electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through the process of 
electrolysis. A fuel cell performs the reverse process of recombining hydrogen and oxygen back into 
water, converting chemical energy into electricity (Elzinga et al. 2014). Reversible hydrogen fuel cells 
(RHFCs) can perform both functions in a single device, however they are still in the pre-commercial 
stage, due to prohibitive production costs.  

Hydrogen can play an important role in reducing emissions and has been shown to be the most cost-
effective option in some cases, as it builds on existing systems (Staffell et al. 2018). Fuel cell costs need 
to be reduced and the harmonies between hydrogen and complementary technologies, such as batteries,

for specific applications need to be explored further. Hydrogen can provide long duration storage to 
deal with prolonged extreme events, such as very low output of wind generation, to support resilience 
of  future  low  carbon  energy  systems.  Research  in  this  technology  focuses  on  improving  roundtrip 
efficiencies, which can be as high as 80% with recycled waste heat and in high-pressure electrolyzers, 
incorporating more efficient compression (Matos et al. 2019). Photo-electrolysis uses solar energy to 
directly generate hydrogen from water (Amirante et al. 2017). 

6.4.4.2  Societal Dimensions of Energy Storage 

Public  awareness  knowledge  about  electricity  storage  technologies,  their  current  state,  and  their 
potential role in future energy systems is limited (Jones et al. 2018). For instance, people do not perceive 
energy system flexibility and storage as a significant issue, or assume storage is already taking place. 
Public  perceptions  differ  across  storage  technologies.  Hydrogen  is  considered  a  modern  and  clean 
technology, but people also have safety concerns. Moreover, the public is uncertain about hydrogen 
storage size and the possibility of storing hydrogen in or near residential areas (Eitan and Fischhendler 
2021). Battery storage both on the household and community level was perceived as slightly positive 
in one study in the UK (Ambrosio-Albala et al. 2020). However, financial costs are seen as a main 
barrier. The potential of electric vehicle batteries to function as flexible storage is limited by the current 
numbers of EV owners and concerns that one’s car battery might not be fully loaded when needed. 

6.4.5  Energy Transport and Transmission 

The linkage between energy supply and distribution, on the one hand, and energy use on the other is 
facilitated by various mechanisms for transporting energy. As the energy system evolves, the way that 
energy is transported will also evolve.  

6.4.5.1  Hydrogen: Low-Carbon Energy Fuel 

Hydrogen  is  a  promising  energy  carrier  for  a  decarbonized  world  (Box  6.9).  It  can  be  utilized  for 
electricity, heat, transport, industrial demand, and energy storage  (Abdin et al. 2020). In low-carbon 
energy  systems,  hydrogen  is  expected  to  be  utilized  in  applications  that  are  not  as  amenable  to 
electrification, such as a fuel for heavy-duty road transport and shipping, or as a chemical feedstock 
(Griffiths et al. 2021; Schemme et al. 2017). Hydrogen could also provide low-carbon heat for industrial 
processes  or  be  utilized  for  direct  reduction  of iron ore  (Vogl  et  al.  2018).  Hydrogen could  replace 
natural gas-based electricity generation (do Sacramento et al. 2013) in certain regions and support the 
integration of variable renewables into electricity systems by providing a means of long-term electricity 
storage. Hydrogen-based carriers, such as ammonia and synthetic hydrocarbons, can likewise be used 
in  energy-intensive  industries  and  the  transport  sector  (Schemme  et  al.  2017;  IRENA  2019b)  (e.g., 
synthetic fuels for aviation). These hydrogen-based energy carriers are easier to store than hydrogen. 
At  present  hydrogen  has  limited  applications  –  mainly  being  produced  onsite  for  the  creation  of 
methanol and ammonia (IEA 2019c), as well as in refineries. 

Low- or zero-carbon produced hydrogen is not currently competitive for large-scale applications, but it 
is likely to have a significant role in future energy systems, due to its wide-range of applications (high 
confidence).  Key  challenges  for  hydrogen  are:  (a)  cost-effective  low/zero  carbon  production,  (b) 
delivery  infrastructure  cost,  (c)  land  area  (i.e.,  ‘footprint’)  requirements  of  hydrogen  pipelines, 
compressor stations, and other infrastructure, (d) challenges in using existing pipeline infrastructure, 
(e) maintaining hydrogen purity, (e) minimizing hydrogen leakage, and (f) the cost and performance of 
end-uses.  Furthermore,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  public  perception  and  social  acceptance  of 
hydrogen technologies and their related infrastructure requirements (Scott and Powells 2020; Iribarren 
et al. 2016) 

Hydrogen Production. Low- or zero-carbon hydrogen can be produced from multiple sources. While 
there  is  no  consensus  on  the  hydrogen  production  spectrum,  “blue”  hydrogen  (Goldmann  and

Dinkelacker 2018) generally refers to hydrogen produced from natural gas combined with CCS through 
processes such as steam methane reforming (SMR)(Sanusi and Mokheimer 2019) and advanced gas 
reforming (Zhou et al. 2020). Low-carbon hydrogen could also be produced from coal coupled with 
CCS (Hu et al. 2020) (Table 6.7). Current estimates are that adding CCS to produce hydrogen from 
SMR will add on average 50% on the capital cost, 10% to fuel, and 100% to operating costs.  For coal 
gasification, CCS will add 5% to the capital and fuel costs and 130% to operating costs (IEA 2019d; 
Staffell et al. 2018). Further, biomass gasification could produce renewable hydrogen, and when joined 
with CCS could provide negative carbon emissions. “Green” hydrogen (Jaszczur et al. 2016) most often 
is referred to as hydrogen produced from zero-carbon electricity sources such as solar  power and wind 
power  (Schmidt  et  al.  2017)  (Table  6.8).  Nuclear  power  could  also  provide  clean  hydrogen,  via 
electrolysis or thermochemical water splitting (EERE 2020). Hydrogen can even be produced pyrolysis 
of  methane  (Sánchez-Bastardo  et  al.  2020),  sometimes  called  as  “turquoise”  hydrogen,  solar 
thermochemical water splitting, biological hydrogen production (cyanobacteria) (Velazquez Abad and 
Dodds 2017), and microbes that use light to make hydrogen (under research)(EIA 2020).

be combined with carbon and transported as a synthetic hydrocarbons (Gumber and Gurumoorthy 2018) 
(IRENA 2019d) as well as be transported via liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or ammonia 
(IRENA 2019d). For synthetic hydrocarbons such as methane or methanol to be considered zero carbon, 
the CO2 used to produce them would need to come from the atmosphere either directly through DACCS 
or indirectly through BECCS (IRENA 2019b). LOHCs are organic substances in liquid or semi-solid 
states,  which  store  hydrogen  based  on  reversible  catalytic  hydrogenation  and  de-hydrogenation  of 
carbon  double  bounds  (Rao  and  Yoon  2020;  Niermann  et  al.  2019).  Hydrogen  produced  from 
electrolysis could also be seen as an electricity energy carrier. This is an example of the PtX processes 
(section 6.4.4), entailing the conversion of electricity to other energy carriers for subsequent use. 

Ammonia is a promising cost-effective hydrogen carrier (Creutzig et al. 2019). Onsite generation of 
hydrogen  for  the  production  of  ammonia  already  occurs  today,  and  the  NH3  could  be  subsequently 
“cracked”  (with  a  15–25%  energy  loss)  to  reproduce  hydrogen  (Bell  and  Torrente-Murciano  2016; 
Hansgen et al. 2010; Montoya et al. 2015). Because the energy density of ammonia is 38% higher than 
liquid hydrogen (Osman and Sgouridis 2018), it is potentially a suitable energy carrier for long-distance 
transport and storage (Salmon et al. 2021) Moreover, ammonia is more easily condensable (liquefied at 
0.8 MPa, 20°C), which provides economically viable hydrogen storage and supply systems. Ammonia 
production and transport are also established industrial processes (∼180 MMT yr-1 (Valera-Medina et 
al. 2017), and hence ammonia is considered to be a scalable and cost-effective hydrogen-based energy 
carrier. At present, most ammonia is used in fertilizers (~80%), followed by many industrial processes, 
such as the manufacturing of mining explosives and petrochemicals (Jiao and Xu 2018). In contrast to 
hydrogen, ammonia can be used directly as a fuel without any phase change for internal combustion 
engines, gas turbines, and industrial furnaces (Kobayashi et al. 2019). Ammonia can also be used in 
low and high temperature fuel cells (Lan and Tao 2014), whereby both electricity and hydrogen can be 
produced  without  any  NOx  emissions.  Furthermore,  ammonia  provides  the  flexibility  to  be 
dehydrogenated for hydrogen-use purposes. Ammonia is considered a carbon-free sustainable fuel for 
electricity generation, since in a complete combustion, only water and nitrogen are produced (Valera-
Medina et al. 2017). Like hydrogen, ammonia could facilitate management of variable RES, due to its 
cost-effective grid-scale energy storage capabilities. In this regard, production of ammonia via hydrogen 
from low- or zero-carbon generation technologies along with ammonia energy recovery technologies 
(Afif et al. 2016) could play a major role in forming a hydrogen and/or ammonia economy to support 
decarbonization. However, there are serious concerns regarding the ability to safely use ammonia for 
all these purposes, given its toxicity - whereas hydrogen is not considered toxic. 

In  general,  challenges  around  hydrogen-based  energy  carriers  -  including  safety  issues  around 
flammability, toxicity, storage, and consumption - require new devices and techniques to facilitate their 
large-scale use. Relatively high capital costs and large electricity requirements are also challenges for 
technologies  that  produce  hydrogen  energy  carriers.  Yet,  these  energy  carriers  could  become 
economically viable through the availability of low-cost electricity generation and excess of renewable 
energy  production  (Daiyan  et  al.  2020)  A  key  challenge in  use  of  ammonia  is related to significant 
amount  of  NOx  emissions,  which  is  released  from  nitrogen  and  oxygen  combustion,  and  unburned 
ammonia. Both have substantial air pollution risks, which can result in lung and other injuries, and can 
reduce visibility (EPA 2001). Due to the low flammability of hydrogen energy carriers such as liquified 
hydrogen (Nilsson et al. 2016) and ammonia (Li et al. 2018), a stable combustion (Zengel et al. 2020; 
Lamas  and  Rodriguez  2019)  in  the  existing  gas  turbines  is  not  currently  feasible.  In  recent 
developments, however, the proportion of hydrogen in gas turbines has been successfully increased, 
and further development of gas turbines may enable them to operate on 100% hydrogen by 2030 (Pflug 
et al. 2019) 

Long-Distance Hydrogen Transport. Hydrogen can allow regional integration and better utilization of 
low- or zero-carbon energy sources (Box 6.9 and Box 6.10). Hydrogen produced from renewables or

other low-carbon sources in one location could be transported for use elsewhere (Philibert 2017; Ameli 
et al. 2020). Depending on the distance to the user and specific energy carrier utilized (e.g., gaseous 
hydrogen  or  LOHC),  various  hydrogen  transport  infrastructures,  distribution  systems,  and  storage 
facilities would be required (Hansen 2020; Schönauer and Glanz 2021) (Figure 6.17).  

Hydrogen  can  be  liquefied  and  transported  at  volume  over  the  ocean  without  pressurization.  This 
requires a temperature of –253ºC and is therefore energy-intensive and costly (Niermann et al. 2021). 
Once  it  reaches  its  destination,  the  hydrogen  needs  to  be  re-gasified,  adding  further  cost.  A 
demonstration  project  is  under  development  exporting  liquid  hydrogen  from  Australia  to  Japan 
(Yamashita  et  al.  2019).  Hydrogen  could  also  be  transported  as  ammonia  by  ocean  in  liquid  form. 
Ammonia is advantageous because it is easier to store than hydrogen  (Zamfirescu and Dincer 2008; 
Nam  et  al.  2018;  Soloveichik  2016).  Liquid  ammonia  requires  temperatures  below  –33ºC  and  is 
therefore more straightforward and less costly to transport than liquified hydrogen and even liquified 
natural gas (Singh and Sahu 2018). A project exporting ammonia from Saudi Arabia to Japan is under 
consideration  (Nagashima  2018).  LOHCs  could  also  be  used  to  transport  hydrogen  at  ambient 
temperature and pressure. This advantageous property of LOHCs makes them similar to oil products, 
meaning they can be transported in existing oil infrastructure including oil tankers and tanks (Niermann 
et al. 2019; IEA 2019). A project is under development to export hydrogen from Brunei to Japan using 
LOHCs (Kurosaki 2018).  

Figure 6.17 Hydrogen value chain. Hydrogen can be produced by various means and input and fuel 
sources. These processes have different emissions implications. Hydrogen can be transported by various 
means and in various forms, and it can be stored in bulk for longer-term use. It also has multiple 
potential end uses. CHP: Combined heat and power  

Intra-Regional  Hydrogen  Transportation.  Within  a  country  or  region,  hydrogen  would  likely  be 
pressurized  and  delivered  as  compressed  gas.  About  three  times  as  much  compressed  hydrogen  by 
volume is required to supply the same amount of energy as natural gas. Security of supply is therefore 
more challenging in hydrogen networks than in natural gas networks. Storing hydrogen in pipelines 
(linepack) would be important to maintaining security of supply (Ameli et al. 2019, 2017). Due to the 
physics of hydrogen, in most cases exiting gas infrastructure would need to be upgraded to transport 
hydrogen.  Transporting  hydrogen  in  medium-  or  high-pressure  networks  most  often  would  require 
reinforcements in compressor stations and pipeline construction routes  (Dohi et al. 2016). There are 
several recent examples of efforts to transport hydrogen by pipeline. For example, in the Iron Mains 
Replacement Programme in the UK, the existing low pressure gas distribution pipes are being converted

from iron to plastic (Committee on Climate Change 2018). In the Netherlands, an existing low-pressure 
12 km natural gas pipeline has been used for transporting hydrogen (Dohi et al. 2016).  

To bypass gas infrastructure in transporting hydrogen, methane can be transported using the existing 
gas infrastructure, while hydrogen can be produced close to the demand centres.  This approach will 
only make sense  if  the methane is  produced in  a manner that  captures  carbon  from the atmosphere 
and/or if CCS is used when the methane is used to produce hydrogen. 

Bulk Hydrogen Storage. Currently, hydrogen is stored in bulk in chemical processes such as metal and 
chemical hydrides as well as in geologic caverns (Andersson and Grönkvist 2019; Caglayan et al. 2019)  
(e.g., salt caverns operate in Sweden) (Elberry et al. 2021). There are still many challenges, however, 
due to salt or hard rock geologies, large size, and minimum pressure requirements of the sites  (IEA 
2019c). Consequently, alternative carbon-free energy carriers, which store hydrogen, may become more 
attractive (Kobayashi et al. 2019; Lan et al. 2012). 

6.4.5.2  Electricity Transmission 

Given the significant geographical variations in the efficiency of renewable resources across different 
regions and continents, electricity transmission could facilitate cost effective deployment of renewable 
generation,  enhance  resilience  and  security  of  supply,  and  increase  operational  efficiency  (high 
confidence).  The  diurnal  and  seasonal  characteristics  of  different  renewable  energy  sources  such  as 
wind,  solar,  and  hydropower  can  vary  significantly  by  location.  Through  enhanced  electricity 
transmission infrastructure, more wind turbines can be deployed in areas with high wind potential and 
more solar panels in areas with larger solar irradiation. Increases in electricity transmission and trade 
can also enhance operational efficiency and reduce or defer the need for investment in peaking plants, 
storage,  or  other  load  management  techniques  needed  to  meet  security  of  supply  requirements 
associated  with  localized  use  of  VRE  sources.  Increased  interconnectivity  of  large-scale  grids  also 
allows the aggregation of ‘smart grid’ solutions such as flexible heating and cooling devices for flexible 
demand in industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors (Hakimi et al. 2020) and EVs (Li et al. 2021; 
Muratori  and  Mai  2020).  In  general,  interconnection  is  more  cost-optimal  for  countries  that  are 
geographically close to each other and can benefit from the diversity of their energy mixes and usage 
(Schlachtberger et al. 2017). Such developments are not without price, however, and amongst other 
concerns, raise issues surrounding land use, public acceptance, and resource acquisition for materials 
necessary for renewable developments (Vakulchuk et al. 2020; Capellán-Pérez et al. 2017).  

A  number  of  studies  have  demonstrated  the  cost  benefits  of  interconnected  grids  in  a  range  of 
geographical  settings, including  across  the  United  States  (Bloom et al.  2020), across  Europe  (2020; 
Newbery et al. 2013; Cluet et al. 2020), between Australia and parts of Asia (Halawa et al. 2018), and 
broader global regions, for example between the Middle East and Europe or North Africa and Europe 
(Tsoutsos et al. 2015). While there is growing interest in interconnection among different regions or 
continents,  a  broad  range  of  geopolitical  and  socio-techno-economic  challenges  would  need  to  be 
overcome to support this level of international co-operation and large-scale network expansion (Bertsch 
et al. 2017; Palle 2021).  

Status of electricity transmission technology.  Long-distance electricity transmission technologies are 
already available. High voltage alternating current (HVAC), high-voltage direct current (HVDC), and 
ultra  HVDC  (UHVDC)  technologies  are  well-established  and  widely  used  for  bulk  electricity 
transmission (Alassi et al. 2019). HVDC is used with underground cables or long-distance overhead 
lines (typically voltages between 100–800 kV (Alassi et al. 2019) where HVAC is infeasible or not 
economic.  A  ~USD  17  bn  project  development  agreement  was  signed  in  January  2021  that  would 
connect  10  GW  of  PVs  in  the  north  of  Australia  via  a  4500  km  3  GW  HVDC  cable  to  Singapore, 
suggesting that this would be cost effective (Sun Cable 2021). In September 2019, the Changji-Guquan 
±1,100  kV  ultra-high  voltage  direct  current  (UHVDC)  transmission  project  built  by  State  Grid

Corporation of China was officially completed and put into operation. The transmission line is able to 
transmit up to 12 GW over 3341 km (Pei et al. 2020). This is the UHVDC transmission project with the 
highest voltage level, the largest transmission capacity, and the longest transmission distance in the 
world (Liu 2015).  

Other technologies that could expand the size of transmission corridors and/or improve the operational 
characteristics include low-frequency AC transmission (LFAC) (Xiang et al. 2021; Tang et al. 2021b) 
and  half-wave  AC  transmission  (HWACT)  (Song et al.  2018;  Xu  et al.  2019). LFAC  is technically 
feasible, but the circumstances in which it is the best economic choice compared to HVDC or HVAC 
still needs to be established (Xiang et al. 2016). HWACT is restricted to very long distances, and it has 
not  been  demonstrated  in  practice,  so  its  feasibility  is  unproven.  There  are  still  a  number  of 
technological challenges for long-distance transmission networks such as protection systems for DC or 
hybrid AC-DC networks (Franck C. et al. 2017; Chaffey 2016), improvement in cabling technology, 
and including the use of superconductors and nanocomposites  (Ballarino et al. 2016; Doukas 2019),  
which require advanced solutions.   

Challenges, barriers, and recommendations. The main challenge to inter-regional transmission is the 
absence of  appropriate market  designs  and  regulatory  and  policy frameworks. In  addition, there  are 
commercial  barriers for  further  enhancement of  cross-border transmission.  The differing impacts  of 
cross-border interconnections on costs and revenues for generation companies in different regions could 
delay  the  development  of  these  interconnectors.  It  is  not  yet  clear  how  the  investment  cost  of 
interconnections should be allocated and recovered, although there is growing support for allocating 
costs  in  accordance  with  the  benefits  delivered  to  the  market  participants.  Increased  cross-border 
interconnection may also require new business models which provide incentives for investment and 
efficient operation, manage risks and uncertainties, and facilitate coordinated planning and governance 
(Poudineh and Rubino 2017).  

Optimizing  the  design  and  operation  of  the  interconnected  transmission  system,  both  onshore  and 
offshore grids, also requires more integrated economic and reliability approaches (Moreno et al. 2012) 
to  ensure  the  optimal  balance  between  the  economics  and  the  provision  of  system  security  while 
maximizing the benefits of smart network technologies.  

A  wide  range  of  factors,  including  generation  profiles,  demand  profiles  circuit  losses,  reliability 
characteristics, and maintenance, as well as the uncertainties around them will need to be considered in 
designing and operating long-distance transmission systems if they are to be widely deployed (De Sa 
and  Al  Zubaidy  2011;  Du  2009;  Djapic  et  al.  2008;  E3G  2021).  Public  support  for  extending 
transmission  systems  will  also  be  crucial,  and  studies  indicate  that  such  support  is  frequently  low 
(Perlaviciute et al. 2018; Vince 2010).   

6.4.6  Demand Side Mitigation Options from an Energy Systems Perspective 

Demand-side measures are fundamental to an integrated approach to low carbon energy systems (high 
confidence).  Mitigation  options,  such  as  wind  parks,  CCS,  and  nuclear  power  plants,  may  not  be 
implemented when actors oppose these options. Further, end users, including consumers, governments, 
businesses and industry, would need to adopt the relevant options, and then use these as intended; user 
adoption can be a key driver to scale up markets for low carbon technologies. This section discusses 
which factors shape the likelihood that end users engage in relevant mitigation actions, focusing on 
consumers; strategies to promote mitigation actions are discussed in Section 6.7.6.1.  

A wide range of actions of end users would reduce carbon emissions in energy systems (Abrahamse et 
al. 2007; Dietz 2013; Creutzig et al. 2018; Hackmann et al. 2014; Grubler et al. 2018), including:  
•  use of low carbon energy sources and carriers. Actors can produce and use their own renewable 
energy (e.g., install solar PV, solar water heaters, heat pumps), buy shares in a renewable energy 
project (e.g., wind shares), or select a renewable energy provider.

adoption  of  technologies  that  support  flexibility  in  energy  use  and  sector  coupling,  thereby 
providing  flexibility  services  by  balancing  demand  and  renewable  energy  supply.  This  would 
reduce the need to use fossil fuels to meet demand when renewable energy production is low and 
put less pressure on deployment of low-emission energy supply systems. Examples are technologies 
to store energy (e.g., batteries and electric vehicles) or that automatically shift appliances on or off 
(e.g., fridges, washing machines).

so that less energy is required to provide the same service. Examples are insulating buildings, and 
passive or energy positive buildings.  
change behaviour to reduce overall energy demand or to match energy demand to available energy 
supplies.  Examples  include  adjusting  indoor  temperature  settings,  reducing  showering  time, 
reducing car use or flying, and operating appliances when renewable energy production is high.  
•  purchase and use products and services that are associated with low GHG emissions during their 
production  (e.g.,  reduce  dairy  and  meat  consumption)  or  for  transporting  products  (e.g.,  local 
products). Also, end users can engage in behaviour supporting a circular economy, by reducing 
waste (e.g., of food), sharing products (e.g., cars, equipment), and refurbishing products (e.g., repair 
rather than buying new products) so that less new products are used. 

• 

Various  factors  shape  whether  such  mitigation  actions  are  feasible  and  considered  by  end  users, 
including contextual factors, individual abilities, and motivational factors. Mitigation actions can be 
facilitated and encouraged by targeting relevant barriers and enablers (section 6.7.6.2). 

Contextual  factors,  such  as  physical  and  climate  conditions,  infrastructure,  available  technology, 
regulations, institutions, culture, and financial conditions define the costs and benefits of mitigation 
options that enable or inhibit their adoption (high confidence). Geographic location and climate factors 
may make some technologies, such as solar PV or solar water heaters, impractical (Chang et al. 2009). 
Culture can inhibit efficient use of home heating or PV (Sovacool and Griffiths 2020), low carbon diets 
(Dubois et al. 2019), and advanced fuel choices (Van Der Kroon et al. 2013). Also, favourable financial 
conditions  promote  the  uptake  of  PV  (Wolske  and  Stern  2018),  good  facilities  increase  recycling 
(Geiger et al. 2019), and vegetarian meal sales increase when more vegetarian options are offered.. 

Mitigation actions are more likely when individuals feel capable to adopt them (Pisano and Lubell 2017; 
Geiger  et  al.  2019),  which  may  depend  on  income  and  knowledge.  Low-income  groups  may  lack 
resources to invest in refurbishments and energy-efficient technology with high upfront costs (Andrews-
Speed and Ma 2016; Chang et al. 2009; Wolske and Stern 2018). Yet, higher income groups can afford 
more carbon-intensive lifestyles (Golley and Meng 2012; Namazkhan et al. 2019; Frederiks et al. 2015; 
Santillán Vera and de la Vega Navarro 2019; Mi et al. 2020; Wiedenhofer et al. 2017). Knowledge of 
the causes and consequences of climate change and of ways to reduce GHG emissions is not always 
accurate, but lack of knowledge is not a main barrier of mitigation actions (Boudet 2019). 

Motivation  to  engage  in  mitigation  action,  reflecting  individuals’  reasons  for  actions,  depends  on 
general goals that people strive for in their life (i.e., values). People who strongly value protecting the 
environment and other people are more likely to consider climate impacts and to engage in a wide range 
of mitigation actions than those who strongly value individual consequences of actions, such as pleasure 
and  money  (Taylor  et  al.  2014;  Steg  2016).  Values affect  which  types  of  costs  and  benefits  people 
consider and prioritize when making choices, including individual, affective, social, and environmental 
costs and benefits (Gowdy 2008; Steg 2016).  

First, people are more likely to engage in mitigation behaviour (i.e., energy savings, energy efficiency, 
resource efficiency in buildings, low-carbon energy generation) when they believe such behaviour has 
more individual benefits than costs (Harland et al. 1999; Steg and Vlek 2009; Kastner and Matthies 
2016; Kastner and Stern 2015; Kardooni et al. 2016; Wolske et al. 2017; Korcaj et al. 2015), including 
financial benefits, convenience, comfort, autonomy, and independence in energy supply (Wolske and

Stern  2018).  Yet,  financial  consequences  seem  less  important  for  decisions  to  invest  in  energy-
efficiency and renewable energy production than people indicate (Zhao et al. 2012).  

Second, people are less likely to engage in mitigation behaviours that are unpleasurable or inconvenient 
(Steg 2016), and more likely to do so when they expect to derive positive feelings from such actions 
(Smith et al. 1994; Pelletier et al. 1998; Steg 2005; Carrus et al. 2008; Brosch et al. 2014; Taufik et al. 
2016). Positive feelings may be elicited when behaviour is pleasurable, but also when it is perceived as 
meaningful (Bolderdijk et al. 2013; Taufik et al. 2015).  

Third, social costs and benefits can affect climate action (Farrow et al. 2017), although people do not 
always recognize this (Nolan et al. 2008; Noppers et al. 2014). People engage more in mitigation actions 
when they think others expect them to do so and when others act as well (Rai et al. 2016; Harland et al. 
1999;  Nolan  et  al.  2008).  Being  part  of  a  group  that  advocates  mitigation  actions  encourages  such 
actions (Biddau et al. 2016; Fielding and Hornsey 2016; Jans et al. 2018). Talking with peers can reduce 
uncertainties and confirm benefits about adoption of renewable energy technology  (Palm 2017), and 
peers can provide social support (Wolske et al. 2017). People may engage in mitigation actions when 
they think this would signal something positive about them (Griskevicius et al. 2010; Milinski et al. 
2006; Kastner and Stern 2015; Noppers et al. 2014). Social influence can also originate from political 
and business leaders (Bouman and Steg 2019); GHG emissions are lower when legislators have strong 
environmental records (Jensen and Spoon 2011; Dietz et al. 2015). 

Fourth,  mitigation  actions,  including  saving  energy  and  hot  water,  limiting  meat  consumption,  and 
investing in energy efficiency, resource efficiency in buildings, and renewable energy generation are 
more likely when people more strongly care about others and the environment (Van Der Werff and Steg 
2015;  Steg  et  al.  2015;  Wolske  et  al.  2017).  People  across  the  world  generally  strongly  value  the 
environment (Bouman and Steg 2019; Steg 2016), suggesting that they are motivated to mitigate climate 
change. The more individuals are aware of the climate impact of their behaviour, the more they think 
their actions can help reduce such impacts, which strengthens their moral norms to act accordingly, and 
promotes mitigation actions (Steg and de Groot 2010; Jakovcevic and Steg 2013; Chen 2015; Wolske 
et al. 2017).  

Initial mitigation actions can encourage engagement in other mitigation actions when people experience 
that such actions are easy and effective (Lauren et al. 2016), and when initial actions make them realize 
they are a pro-environmental person, motivating them to engage in more mitigation actions so as to be 
consistent (van der Werff et al. 2014; Lacasse 2015, 2016; Peters et al. 2018). This implies it would be 
important to create conditions that make it likely that initial mitigation actions motivate further actions. 

6.4.7  Summary of Mitigation Options 

Designing feasible, desirable, and cost-effective energy sector mitigation strategies requires comparison 
between the different mitigation options. One such metric is the cost of delivering one unit of energy, 
for example, the levelized cost, or USD MWh-1, of electricity produced from different sources. LCOEs 
are useful because they normalize the costs per unit of service provided. While useful in characterizing 
options in broad strokes, it is important to acknowledge and understand several caveats associated with 
these  metrics,  particularly  when  applied  globally.  They  may  be  constructed  with  different  discount 
rates; they require information on energy input costs for options that require energy inputs (e.g., fossil 
electricity generation, biofuels); they depend on local resource availability, for example solar insolation 
for solar power, wind classes for wind power, and rainfall and streamflow for hydropower; and actual 
implementation costs may include additional elements, for example, the costs of managing electricity 
grids heavily dependent on VRE electricity sources. These complicating factors vary across regions, 
some depend strongly on the policy environment in which mitigation options are deployed, and some 
depend on how technologies are constructed and operated.

The literature provides multiple LCOE estimates for mitigation options today and in the future (see 
Table  6.9  for  electricity  generation  options).  LCOE  ranges  for  low-  and  zero-carbon  electricity 
technologies overlap with LCOE’s of fossil generation without CCS. For example, LCOEs for utility 
solar and wind today and in the future overlap with those of new coal and gas without  CCS (Figure 
6.18, NREL 2021; Lazard, 2020; IEA WEO 2020, IEA WEO 2020). Some of the overlap stems from 
differences  in  assumptions  or  regional  conditions  that  apply  to  all  technologies  (e.g.,  variations  in 
assumed  discount  rates),  but  the  overlap  also  reflects  the  fact  that  low-  and  zero-carbon  electricity 
generation options are, and will be, less expensive than emitting options in many regions. Future cost 
projections also illustrate that several technologies are anticipated to experience further cost declines 
over  the  coming  decades,  reinforcing  the  increasingly  competitiveness  of  low-  and  zero-carbon 
electricity. For example, IEA’s LCOEs estimates for offshore wind halve between 2020 and 2040 in 
several regions (IEA WEO 2020).

Figure 6.18 Range of LCOEs (in USD cents kWh-1) from recent studies for different electricity generating 

technologies circa 2020 and in the future between 2020-2040. LCOEs are primarily taken from recent 
studies, because the costs of some technologies are changing rapidly. To make the figure more tractable 
across the studies, we highlight the data from IEA WEO 2020 STEPS scenario in red (EIA, 2020), the EIA 
AEO 2021 in blue (EIA, 2021), NREL ATB 2021 in green, (NREL, 2021), and IRENA Renewable Power 
Generation Costs in 2020 in yellow (IRENA, 2021). All other studies are shown in light grey markers. 
Marker shapes identify the regions included in the studies. Studies that included several regions are labelled 
as global. Only sources that provided LCOEs are included. Ranges for studies frequently reflect variations 
among regional estimates. Studies that are shown as a mid-point and a solid line represent studies that 
reported either a median or an average, and that had either a confidence interval or a minimum and a 
maximum reported. Dashed lines with markers at the end represent the range of values reported in studies 
that had several point estimates for either different regions or used different assumptions. All estimates 
were converted to 2020 USD. The publication year was used if no USD year was provided. Some studies 
included transmissions costs, and some the CCS studies included storage and sequestration costs, while 
others did not. Vertical axis is capped at USD2020 0.30 kWh-1, but some estimates for hydro, geothermal, 
natural gas and bioelectricity were higher than 0.30. The grey horizontal band denotes the range of fossil 
fuel electricity LCOEs in circa 2020.   

A more direct metric of mitigation options is the cost to reduce one tonne of CO2 or equivalent GHGs, 
or  USD  tCO2-eq-1  avoided.  In  addition  to  the  comparison  challenges  noted  above,  this  metric  must 
account for the costs and emissions of the emitting options that is being displaced by the low-carbon 
option.  Assumptions  about  the  displaced  option  can  lead  to  very  different  mitigation  cost  estimates

(Table 6.9). Despite these challenges, these metrics are useful for identifying broad trends and making 
broad  comparisons,  even  from  the  global  perspective  in  this  assessment.  But  local  information  will 
always be critical to determine which options are most cost-effective in any specific applications.

The feasibility and desirability of mitigation options extends well beyond the market economic costs of 
installation  and  operation  (Section  6.4.1).  Figure  6.19  summarizes  the  barriers  and  enablers  for 
implementing different mitigation options in energy systems. The feasibility of different options can be 
enhanced by removing barriers and/or strengthening enablers of the implementation of the options. The 
feasibility of options may differ across context (e.g., region), time (e.g., 2030 versus 2050), scale (e.g., 
small versus large) and the long-term warming goal (e.g., 1.5°C versus 2°C).

6.5  Climate Change Impacts on the Energy System 

6.5.1  Climate Impacts on the Energy System 

Many  components  of  the  energy  system  are  affected  by  individual  weather  events  and  climate 
conditions (Table 6.10). In addition, a range of compounding effects can be anticipated, as the complex, 
interconnected climate and energy system are influenced by multiple weather and climate conditions. 
This raises the question of whether the energy system transformation needed to limit warming will be 
impacted by climate change.

IPCC WGIII AR6 

The impacts of climate change on the energy system can be divided into three areas: impacts on the 
energy supply, impacts on energy consumption, and impacts on energy infrastructure. The rest of this 
section  focuses  on  how  the  future  changes  in  climate  drivers  might  affect  the  ability  of  the  energy 
system transformation needed to mitigate climate change. The discussion of energy infrastructure in 
this section is limited to electric electricity system vulnerability. 

6.5.2  Impacts on Energy Supply 

The  increased  weather-dependency  of  future  low-carbon  electricity  systems  amplifies  the  possible 
impacts of climate change (Staffell and Pfenninger 2018). However, globally climate change impacts 
on electricity generation – including hydro, wind and solar power potentials – should not compromise 
climate  mitigation  strategies  (high  confidence).  Many  of  the  changes  in  the  climate  system  will  be 
geographically complex at the regional and local levels. Thus, regionally climate change impacts on 
electricity generation could be significant. Climate change impacts on bioenergy potentials are more 
uncertain because of uncertainties associated with the crop response to climate change, future water 
availability and crop deployment. Climate change can reduce the efficiency of thermal power generation 
and increase the risk of power plant shutdowns during droughts. The potential additional cooling water 
needs of CCS can increase these risks. 

6.5.2.1  Hydropower  

The  impacts  of  climate  change  on  hydropower  will  vary  by  region.  High  latitudes  in  the  northern 
hemisphere are anticipated to experience increased runoff and hydropower potential. For other regions, 
studies  find  both  increasing  and  decreasing  runoff  and  hydropower  potential.  Areas  with  decreased 
runoff are anticipated to experience reduced hydropower production and increased water conflict among 
different economic activities. (high confidence)   

Hydropower  production  is  directly  related  to  the  availability  of  water.  Changes  in  runoff  and  its 
seasonality  and  changes  in  temperature  and  precipitation  intensity  will  influence  hydro  electricity 
production  (IHA  2019).  In  general,  increased  precipitation  will  increase  water  availability  and 
hydropower production. Increased precipitation intensity, however, may impact the integrity of dam 
structures  and  affect  power  production  by  increasing  debris  accumulation  and  vegetation  growth. 
Additionally, increased precipitation intensity  results in the  silting  of  the reservoirs  or  increases the 
amount of water spilt, resulting in erosion (Schaeffer et al. 2012; IHA 2019). Climate change will likely 
lead to higher air temperatures, resulting in more surface evaporation, less water storage, and loss of 
equipment  efficiency  (Ebinger  and  Vergara  2011;  Fluixá-Sanmartín  et  al.  2018;  Hock  et  al.  2019; 
Mukheibir 2013). Climate change may alter the demands for water use by other sectors that often rely 
on stored water in multi-purpose reservoirs and may therefore generate conflicts over water use. The 
increased need for water for irrigation and/or industry can affect the availability of water for hydropower 
generation (Solaun and Cerdá 2017; Spalding-Fecher et al. 2016). Higher temperatures increase glacier 
melt, increasing water availability for hydropower while the glaciers exist. Changes in the timing of 
snow and ice melt may require upgrading in storage capacity and adaptation of the hydropower plant 
management for fully exploiting the increase in water availability.

Global Solar Atlas (ESMAP 2019) 

Figure 6.20 Global spatial patterns of changes in gross hydropower potential based on climate forcing 
from five climate models. Changes are shown for the 2050s (upper) and the 2080s (lower) for the low 
emission scenario (RCP2.6; left) and highest emission scenario (RCP8.5; right) scenarios relative to the 
control period (1971–2000). [Data source: (van Vliet et al. 2016a)]. 

The conclusions regarding climate change impacts on hydropower vary due to differences in modelling 
assumptions and methodology, such as choice of the climate and hydrological models, choice of metrics 
(e.g., projected production vs hydropower potential), level of modelling details between local and global 
studies, reservoir operation assumptions.  Also important is how hydropower production matches up 
with other reservoir purposes, accounting for other water and energy users, and how the competing uses 
are  impacted  by  climate  change  (Turner  et  al.  2017;  van  Vliet  et  al.  2016b).  Nonetheless,  analyses 
consistently demonstrate that the global impact of climate change on hydropower will be small, but the 
regional  impacts  will  be  larger,  and  will  be  both  positive  and  negative  (Figure  6.20)  Gross  global 
hydropower potential in the 2050s has been estimated to slightly decrease (Hamududu and Killingtveit 
2012) between 0.4% (for the low emission scenario) and 6.1% (for the highest emission scenario) for 
the 2080s compared to 1971–2000 (van Vliet et al. 2016a).  

Regional changes in hydropower are estimated from 5–20% increases for most areas in high latitudes 
(van  Vliet  et  al.  2016b;  Turner  et  al.  2017)  to  decreases  of  5–20%  in  areas  with  increased  drought 
conditions  (Cronin  et  al.  2018).  Models  show  a  consistent  increase  in  streamflow  and  hydropower 
production by 2080 in high latitudes of the northern hemisphere and parts of the tropics (Figure 6.20) 
(e.g.,  central  Africa  and  southern  Asia)  while  decreasing  in  the  U.S.,  southern  and  central  Europe, 
Southeast Asia and southern South America, Africa and Australia (van Vliet et al. 2016c,a). Decreases 
in hydropower production are indicated for parts of North America, central and southern Europe, the 
Middle East, central Asia and Southern South America. Studies disagree on the changes in hydropower 
production in China, central South America, and partially in southern Africa (Solaun and Cerdá 2019; 
Hamududu and Killingtveit 2012; van Vliet et al. 2016b; Fan et al. 2020).

6.5.2.2  Wind Energy 

Climate change will not substantially impact future wind resources and will not compromise the ability 
of wind energy to support low-carbon transitions (high confidence). Changing wind variability may 
have a small to modest impact on backup energy and storage needs (low confidence); however, current 
evidence is largely from studies focused on Europe.  

Long-term  global  wind  energy  resources  are  not  expected  to  substantially  change  in  future  climate 
scenarios (Karnauskas et al. 2018; Yalew et al. 2020; Pryor et al. 2020). However, recent research has 
indicated consistent shifts in the geographic position of atmospheric jets in the high emission scenarios 
(Harvey et al. 2014), which would decrease wind power potentials across the Northern Hemisphere 
mid-latitudes and increase wind potentials across the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere. However, 
the climate models used to make these assessments differ in how well they can reproduce the historical 
wind resources and wind extremes, which raises questions about the robustness of their predictions of 
future wind resources (Pryor et al. 2020).  

There are many regional studies on changes in wind resources from climate change. For Europe, there 
is  medium  evidence  and  moderate  agreement  that  wind  resources  are  already  increasing  and  will 
continue  to  increase  in  Northern  Europe  and  decrease  in  Southern  Europe  (Moemken  et  al.  2018; 
Carvalho et al. 2017; Devis et al. 2018). For North America, the various studies have low agreement 
for the changes in future wind resources in part because the year-to-year variations in wind resources 
are often larger than the future change due to climate change (Johnson and Erhardt 2016; Wang et al. 
2020b; Costoya et al. 2020; Chen 2020). Studies show increases in future wind resources in windy areas 
in South America (Ruffato-Ferreira et al. 2017; de Jong et al. 2019). No robust future changes in wind 
resources have been identified in China (Xiong et al. 2019). However, none of the global or regional 
studies of the effects of climate change on wind resources considers the fine-scale dependence of wind 
resources on the topography and wind direction (Sanz Rodrigo et al. 2016; Dörenkämper et al. 2020) 
or the effect of expanding wind energy exploitation (Lundquist et al. 2019; Volker et al. 2017). There 
is limited evidence that extreme wind speeds, which can damage wind turbines, will increase due to 
climate change (Pes et al. 2017; Pryor et al. 2020). Nevertheless, projected changes in Europe and North 
America – regions where the most extensive analysis has been undertaken – are expected to be within 
the estimates embedded in the design standards of wind turbines (Pryor and Barthelmie 2013).  

Future  wind  generation  in  Europe  could  decrease  in  summer  and  autumn,  increasing  in  winter  in 
northern-central Europe but decreasing in southernmost Europe (Carvalho et al. 2017). Towards 2100, 
intra-annual variations increase in most of Europe, except around the Mediterranean area (Reyers et al. 
2016), but this may reflect natural multidecadal variability (Wohland et al. 2019b). Wind speeds may 
become  more  homogeneous  over  large  geographical  regions  in  Europe  due  to  climate  change, 
increasing the likelihood of large areas experiencing high or low wind speeds simultaneously (Wohland 
et al. 2017). These changes could result in fewer benefits in the transmission of wind generation between 
countries and increased system integration costs. Europe could require a modest increase (up to 7%) in 
backup  energy  towards  the  end of the  21st  century  due  to  more  homogeneous  wind conditions  over 
Europe (Wohland et al. 2017; Weber et al. 2018). However, other studies report that impact of climate 
change is substantially smaller than interannual variability, with no significant impact on the occurrence 
of extreme low wind production events in Europe (Van Der Wiel et al. 2019). If European electricity 
systems are designed to manage the effects of existing weather variability on wind power, they can 
likely also cope with climate change impacts on wind power (Ravestein et al. 2018). Changes in wind 
generation variability caused by climate change are also reported for North America (Haupt et al. 2016; 
Losada Carreño et al. 2018), with modest impacts on electricity system operation (Craig et al. 2019).

6.5.2.3  Solar Energy 

Climate change is not expected to substantially impact global solar insolation and will not compromise 
the ability of solar energy to support low-carbon transitions (high confidence). Models show dimming 
and brightening in certain regions, driven by cloud, aerosol and water vapour trends [WGI,ch12,p31].  
The increase in surface temperature, which affects all regions, decreases solar power output by reducing 
the PV panel efficiency. In some models and climate scenarios, the increases in solar insolation are 
counterbalanced  by  reducing  efficiency  due  to  rising  surface  air  temperatures,  which  increase 
significantly  in  all  models  and  scenarios  (Jerez  et  al.  2015;  Bartók  et  al.  2017;  Emodi  et  al.  2019). 
Increases  in  aerosols  would  reduce  the  solar  resource  available  and  add  to  maintenance  costs 
[AR6,WGI,ch12]. 

In  many  emission  scenarios,  the  effect  on  solar  PV  from  temperature-induced  efficiency  losses  is 
smaller than the effect expected from changes on solar insolation due to variations in water vapour and 
clouds in most regions. Also, future PV technologies will likely have higher efficiency, which would 
offset temperature-related declines  (Müller  et al.  2019).  Cloud  cover  is  projected  to  decrease in  the 
subtropics (around –0.05% per year), including parts of North America, vast parts of Europe and China, 
South  America,  South  Africa  and  Australia  (medium  agreement,  medium  evidence).  Thus,  models 
project modest (&lt; 3%) increases in solar PV by the end of the century for southern Europe, northern 
and southern Africa, Central America, and the Caribbean (Emodi et al. 2019). There are several studies 
projecting decreasing solar production, but these are generally influenced by other factors, for example, 
increasing  air  pollution  (Ruosteenoja  et  al.  2019).  The  multi-model  means  for  solar  insolation  in 
regional models  decrease  0.60 W m-2 per decade from 2006 to 2100 over most of Europe (Bartók et 
al. 2017), with the most significant decreases in the Northern countries (Jerez et al. 2015).  

6.5.2.4  Bioenergy 

Climate change can affect biomass resource potential directly, via changes in the suitable range (i.e., 
the area where bioenergy crops can grow) and/or changes in yield, and indirectly, through changes in 
land  availability.  Increases  in  CO2  concentration  increase  biomass  yield;  climate  changes  (e.g., 
temperature, precipitation, etc.) can either increase or decrease the yield and suitable range.  

Climate change will shift the suitable range for bioenergy towards higher latitudes, but the net change 
in the total suitable area is uncertain (high confidence). Several studies show northward shifts in the 
suitable range for bioenergy in the northern hemisphere (Tuck et al. 2006; Bellarby et al. 2010; Preston 
et al. 2016; Barney and DiTomaso 2010; Hager et al. 2014; Conant et al. 2018; Cronin et al. 2018; 
Wang et al. 2014a), but the net effect of climate change on total suitable area varies by region, species, 
and climate model (Barney and DiTomaso 2010; Hager et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014a).  

The  effect  of  climate  change  on  bioenergy  crop  yields  will  vary  across  region  and  feedstock  (high 
confidence); however, in general, yields will decline in low latitudes (medium confidence) and increase 
in high latitudes (low confidence) (Haberl et al. 2010; Cosentino et al. 2012; Mbow et al. 2019; Cronin 
et al. 2018; Preston et al. 2016). However, the average change in yield varies significantly across studies, 
depending on the feedstock, region, and other factors (Dolan et al. 2020; Kyle et al. 2014) Mbow et al. 
(2019); Beringer et al. (2011). Only a few studies extend the modelling of climate change impacts on 
bioenergy  to  quantify  the  effect  on  bioenergy  deployment  or  its  implications  on  the  energy  system 
(Calvin et al. 2013, 2019; Thornton et al. 2017; Kyle et al. 2014). These studies find that changes in 
deployment  are  of  the  same  sign  as  changes  in  yield;  that  is,  if  yields  increase,  then  deployment 
increases. 

Some  of  the  uncertainty  in  the  sign  and  magnitude  of  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  bioenergy 
potential is due to uncertainties in CO2 fertilization (the increase in photosynthesis due to increases in 
atmospheric CO2 concentration) (Bonjean Stanton et al. 2016; Haberl et al. 2011; Cronin et al. 2018; 
Solaun  and  Cerdá  2019;  Yalew  et  al.  2020).  For  example,  earlier  studies  found  that  without  CO2

fertilization,  climate  change  will  reduce  global  bioenergy  potential  by  about  16%;  with  CO2 
fertilization, however, climate change increases this potential by 45% (Haberl et al. 2011). However, 
newer studies in the U.S. find little effect of CO2 fertilization on switchgrass yield (Dolan et al. 2020). 
There  is  also  a  considerable  uncertainty  across  climate  and  crop  models  in  estimating  bioenergy 
potential (Hager et al. 2014).  

6.5.2.5  Thermal power plants 

The operation of thermal power plants will be affected by climate change, deriving from changes in the 
ambient  conditions  like  temperature,  humidity  and  water  availability  (Schaeffer  et  al.  2012)  (high 
confidence). Changes in ambient temperature have relatively small impacts on coal-fired and nuclear 
power plants (Rankine cycle); however, gas-fired power plants (Brayton or combined-cycle) may have 
their  thermal  efficiency  and  power  output  significantly  decreased  (De  Sa  and  Al  Zubaidy  2011; 
Schaeffer et al. 2012). Droughts decrease potential cooling water for thermal power plants and increase 
the probability of water outlet temperatures exceeding regulatory limits, leading to lower production or 
even  shutdowns.  Thermal  power  utilization  has  been  reported  to  be  on  average  3.8%  lower  during 
drought years globally (van Vliet et al. 2016c). and further significant decreases in available thermal 
power plant capacity due to climate change are projected  (Koch et al. 2014; van Vliet et al. 2016b; 
Yalew et al. 2020) . An increase in climate-related nuclear power disruptions has been reported in the 
past decades globally (Ahmad 2021).  

Carbon capture may increase cooling water usage significantly, especially in retrofits, with up to 50% 
increase in water usage for coal-fired power plants globally, depending on the CCS technology (Rosa 
et al. 2020, Section 6.4). In Asia, planned coal capacity is expected to be vulnerable to droughts, sea 
level rise, and rising air temperatures, and this may be exacerbated by incorporating carbon capture 
(Wang et al. 2019c). Recently, however, studies have proposed designs of CCS with a minimal increase 
in water requirements (Mikunda et al. 2021; Magneschi et al. 2017).  

Older thermal power plants can be retrofitted to mitigate climate impacts by altering and redesigning 
the cooling systems (Westlén 2018), although the costs for these solutions may be high. For example, 
dry cooling may be used instead of once-through cooling; however, it lowers thermal efficiency and 
would leave plants vulnerable to ambient temperature increase (Ahmad 2021). Closed-circuit cooling 
is much less sensitive to water temperature than once-through cooling (Bonjean Stanton et al. 2016). 
Modifying policies and regulation of water and heat emissions from power plants may also be used to 
mitigate plant reliability problems induced by climate change (Eisenack 2016; Mu et al. 2020), albeit 
with  potential  impacts  for  other  water  users  and  ecology.  Improvements  in  water  use  and  thermal 
efficiencies and the use of transmission capabilities over large geographical regions to mitigate risks on 
individual plants are also possible mitigation options (Miara et al. 2017).  

6.5.3  Impacts on Energy Consumption 

Heating demand will decrease, and cooling demand will increase in response to climate change. Peak 
load may increase more than energy consumption, and the changing spatial and temporal load patterns 
can  impact  transmission  and  needs  for  storage,  demands-side  management,  and  peak-generating 
capacity. (high confidence) 

Climate change will decrease heating demands, especially in cold regions, and it will increase cooling 
demands, especially in warm regions (Yalew et al. 2020). Recent studies report significant net impacts, 
with the commercial and industrial sectors and substantial air condition penetration driving an increase 
in energy demand (De Cian and Sue Wing 2019; Levesque et al. 2018; van Ruijven et al. 2019; Davis 
and Gertler 2015; Yalew et al. 2020). For example, globally, De Cian and Sue Wing (2019) found a 7–
17% increase in energy consumption due to climate change in 2050, with the range depending on the 
climate  change scenario.  The  overall  effects  of  climate  change on  building  energy  consumption are

regionally  dependent.  For  example,  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  find  that  reduced  heating  will  outweigh 
increased cooling in the residential buildings in Europe, but the reverse will be true in China. 

While many studies have focused on energy consumption, climate extremes are expected to alter peak 
energy  demands,  with  the  potential  for  blackouts,  brownouts,  and  other  short-term  energy  system 
impacts (Yalew et al. 2020). For example, peak energy demand during heatwaves can coincide with 
reduced  transmission  and  distribution  capacity  at  higher  temperatures.  In  large  cities,  extreme  heat 
events increase cooling degree days significantly, with the urban heat island effect compounding the 
impact (Morakinyo et al. 2019). One study found that total electricity consumption at the end of the 
century in the U.S. could increase on average by 20% during summer months and decrease on average 
by  6%  in  the  winder  (Ralston  Fonseca  et  al.  2019).  While  the  average  increase  in  consumption  is 
modest,  climate  change  is  projected  to  have  severe  impacts  on  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  peak 
electricity loads. (Auffhammer et al. 2017). Bartos et al. (2016) find that peak per-capita summertime 
load  in  the  U.S.  may  rise  by  4.2%–15%  by  mid-century.  Efficient  cooling  technologies  and  other 
demand  side  measures  can  limit  cooling  energy  loads  during  periods  of  particularly  high 
demand(Dreyfus et al. 2020; International Energy Agency (IEA) 2018).

Box  6.6 Energy Resilience 

In February 2021, the state of Texas was hit by three major storms and suffered significant scale power 
outages.  More  than  4.5  million  homes  and  businesses  on  the  Texas  electric  grid  were  left  without 
electricity for days, limiting the ability to heat homes during dangerously low temperatures and leading 
to  food  and  clean  water  shortages  (Busby  et  al.  2021).  The  Texas  and  other  events  –  e.g.,  during 
Typhoon Haiyan that affected Southeast Asia in 2013; the Australian bush fires in 2019–2020 and forest 
fires in 2018 in California; water shortages in Cape Town, South Africa in 2018 and the western United 
States during 2021 – raise the question of whether future low-carbon energy systems will be more or 
less resilient than those of today.  

Some  characteristics  of  low-carbon  energy  systems  will  make  them  less  resilient.  Droughts  reduce 
hydroelectric electricity generation (Gleick 2016; van Vliet et al. 2016c); wind farms do not produce 
electricity in calm conditions or shut down in very strong winds (Petersen and Troen 2012); solar PV 
generation  is  reduced  by  clouds  and  is less  efficient under  extreme  heat,  dust  storms,  and  wildfires 
(Perry  and  Troccoli  2015; Jackson  and  Gunda  2021).  In  addition,  the  electrification  of  heating  will 
increase  the  weather  dependence  of  electricity  consumption  (Staffell  and  Pfenninger  2018;  Gea-
Bermúdez et al. 2021). Non-renewable generation, for example from nuclear and fossil power plants, 
are also vulnerable to high temperatures and droughts as they depend on water for cooling (Cronin et 
al. 2018; Ahmad 2021). 

But some aspects of low-carbon energy systems will make them more resilient. Wind and solar farms 
are  often  spread  geographically,  which  reduces  the  chances  of  being  affected  by  the  same  extreme 
weather event (Perera et al. 2020). The diversification of energy sources, in which each component has 
different  vulnerabilities,  increases  resilience.  Less  reliance  on  thermal  electricity  generation 
technologies will reduce the risks of curtailment or efficiency losses from droughts and heat waves. 
(Lohrmann et al. 2019). More generally, increased electricity system integration and flexibility (Section 
6.4.3)  and  weatherization  of  generators  increases  electricity  system  resilience  (Heffron  et  al.  2021; 
Busby et al. 2021). Likewise, local district micro-grids with appropriate enabling technologies (e.g., 
distributed generation, energy storage, greater demand-side participation, electric vehicles) may ensure 
access  to  electricity  during  major  long-duration  power  outage  events  and  radically  enhance  the 
resilience of supply of essential demand (Stout et al. 2019).

6.5.4  Impacts on Electricity System Vulnerability 

While long-term trends are important for electricity system planning, short-term effects associated with 
loss of power can be disruptive and lead to significant economic losses along with cascading impacts 
on  health  and  safety.  Extreme  weather  and  storms  threaten  the  electricity  system  in  different  ways, 
affecting system resilience, reliability, and adequacy (Moreno-Mateos et al. 2020). The implications of 
climate change for electricity system vulnerability will depend on the degree to which climate change 
alters the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.   The complex compounding effects of 
simultaneous events (e.g., high winds and lightning occurring at the same time) are not well understood. 

High wind speeds can shear lines through mechanical failure or cause lines to collide, causing transient 
events (Panteli and Mancarella 2015; Yalew et al. 2020). Hurricane conditions can damage electricity 
system  infrastructures,  including  utility-scale  wind  and  solar  PV  plants.  Electricity  systems  may 
experience  high  demand  when  lines  are  particularly  at  risk  from  mechanical  failure  from  wind  and 
storm-related  effects.  However,  except  for  medium  evidence  of  increases  in  heavy  precipitation 
associated with tropical cyclones, there is limited evidence that extreme wind events will increase in 
frequency or intensity in the future (Kumar et al. 2015; Pryor et al. 2020). 

Wildfires pose a significant threat to electricity systems in dry conditions and arid regions (Dian et al. 
2019). With climate change, wildfires will probably become more frequent (Flannigan et al. 2013) and 
more difficult to address given that they frequently coincide with dry air and  can be exacerbated by 
high winds (Mitchell 2013). 

Lightning can cause wildfires or common-mode faults on electricity systems associated with vegetation 
falling on power substations or overhead lines but is more generally associated with flashovers and 
overloads  (Balijepalli  et  al.  2005).  Climate  change  may  change  the  probability  of  lightning-related 
events (Romps et al. 2014).  

Snow and icing can impact overhead power lines by weighing them down beyond their mechanical 
limits, leading to collapse and cascading outages (Feng et al. 2015). Snow can also lead to flashovers 
on lines due to wet snow accumulation on insulators (Croce et al. 2018; Yaji et al. 2014) and snow and 
ice  can  impact  wind  turbines  (Davis  et  al.  2016).  Climate  change  will  lower  risk  of  snow  and  ice 
conditions (McColl et al. 2012), but there is still an underlying risk of sporadic acute cold conditions 
such as those associated with winter storms in Texas in 2021 (Box  6.). 

Flooding poses a threat to the transmission and distribution systems by inundating low-lying substations 
and underground cables. Coastal flooding also poses a threat to electricity system infrastructure. Rising 
sea levels from climate change and associated storm surge may also pose a significant risk for coastal 
electricity systems (Entriken and Lordan 2012).  

Temperature  increases  influence  electricity  load  profiles  and  electricity  generation,  as  well  as 
potentially  impact  supporting  information  and  communication  infrastructure.  Heat  can  pose  direct 
impacts to electricity system equipment such as transformers. Referred to as solar heat faults, they occur 
under high temperatures and low wind speeds and can be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect 
(McColl et al. 2012). Increasing temperatures affect system adequacy by reducing electric transmission 
capacity,  simultaneously increasing  peak  load  due to increased  air  conditioning needs  (Bartos  et  al. 
2016).

Box  6.7 Impacts of Renewable Energy Production on Climate 

While  climate  change  will  affect  energy  systems  (Section  6.5),  the  reverse  is  potentially  also  true: 
increasing the use of renewable energy sources could affect local climate. Large solar PV arrays and

hydroelectric dams darken the land surface, and wind turbines extract the wind’s kinetic energy near 
the Earth’s surface. Their environmental impacts of renewable energy production are mostly confined 
to areas close to the production sources and have shown to be trivial compared to the mitigation benefits 
of renewable energy (high confidence).  

Solar Energy. Observations and model simulations have addressed whether large-scale solar PV power 
plants can alter the local and regional climate. In rural areas at the local scale, large-scale solar PV farms 
change  the  surface  characteristics  and  affect  air  temperatures  (Taha  2013).  Measurements  in  rural 
Arizona,  U.S.  show  local  nighttime  temperatures  3–4°C  warmer  at  the  PV  farm  than  surroundings 
(Barron-Gafford et al. 2016). In contrast, measurements in urban settings show that solar PV panels on 
roofs provide a cooling effect (Ma et al. 2017; Taha 2013). On the regional scale, modelling studies 
suggest cooling in urban areas (0.11–0.53°C) and warming in rural areas (up to 0.27°C) (Millstein and 
Menon  2011).  Global  climate  model  simulations  show  that  solar  panels  induce  regional  cooling  by 
converting part of the incoming solar energy to electricity (Hu et al. 2016). However, converting the 
generated electricity to heat in urban areas increases regional and local temperatures, compensating for 
the cooling effect.  

Wind Energy. Surface temperature changes in the vicinity of wind farms have been detected (Xia et al. 
2019; Smith et al. 2013; Lee and Lundquist 2017; Takle et al. 2019) in the form of nighttime warming. 
Data from field campaigns suggest that a “suppression of cooling” can explain the observed warming 
(Takle et al. 2019). Regional and climate models have been used to describe the interactions between 
turbines and the atmosphere and find minor impacts (Vautard et al. 2014). More sophisticated models 
confirm the local warming effect of wind farms but report that the impact on the regional area is slight 
and occasional (Wang et al. 2019d). Wind turbines alter the transport and dissipation of momentum 
near the surface but do not directly impact the Earth's energy balance (Fischereit et al. 2021). However, 
the secondary modifications to the energy and water exchanges have added implications for the climate 
system (Jacobson and Archer 2012). 

Hydropower. The potential climate impacts of hydropower concentrate on the GHG emissions from 
organic matter  decomposition  when  the  carbon cycle is  altered by  the  flooding of  the  hydroelectric 
power plant reservoir (Ocko and Hamburg 2019), but emissions from organic matter decomposition 
decrease over time. The darker surface of the reservoir, compared to the lighter surrounding land may 
counterbalance part of the reduced GHG emissions by hydropower production (Wohlfahrt et al. 2021). 
However, these impacts vary significantly among facilities due to the surrounding land properties and 
the area inundated by the reservoir.

6.6   Key Characteristics of Net Zero Energy Systems 

6.6.1  What is a Net Zero Energy System? 

Limiting warming to well below 2°C requires that CO2 emissions from the energy sector be reduced to 
near zero or even below zero (Chapter 3, 6.7). Policies, technologies, behaviours, investments, and other 
factors will determine the speed at which countries transition to net zero energy systems – those that 
emit very little or no emissions. An understanding of these future energy systems can help to chart a 
course toward them over the coming decades.  

This section synthesizes current understanding of  net zero energy systems. Discussions surrounding 
efforts  to  limit  warming  are  frequently  communicated  in  terms  of  the  point  in  time  at  which  net 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach zero, accompanied by substantial reductions in non-CO2 emissions

IPCC WGIII AR6 

(IPCC  2018,  Chapter  3). Net-zero  GHG  goals  are  also  common,  and  they  require  net-negative  CO2 
emissions to compensate for residual non-CO2 emissions. Economy-wide CO2 and GHG goals appear 
in many government and corporate decarbonization strategies, and they are used in a variety of ways. 
Most  existing  carbon-neutrality  commitments  from  countries  and  subnational  jurisdictions  aim  for 
economies with very low emissions rather than zero emissions. Offsets, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
methods, and/or land sink assumptions are used to achieve net zero goals (Kelly Levin et al. 2020). 

Precisely describing a net zero energy system is complicated by the fact that different scenarios attribute 
different future CO2 emissions to the energy system, even under scenarios where economy-wide CO2 
emissions reach net zero. It is also complicated by the dependence of energy system configurations on 
unknown future conditions like population and economic growth, and technological change. The energy 
system is not the only source or sink of CO2 emissions. Terrestrial systems may store or emit carbon, 
and CDR options like BECCS or DACCS can be used to store CO2, relieving pressure on the energy 
system (Chapter 3). The location of such CDR options is ambiguous, as it might be deployed within or 
outside of the energy sector (Figure 6.21), and many CDR options, such as DACCS, would be important 
energy consumers (Bistline and Blanford 2021a, 6.6.2). If CDR methods are deployed outside of the 
energy system (e.g., net negative agriculture, forestry, and land use CO2 emissions), it is possible for 
the energy system to still emit CO2 but have economy-wide emissions of zero or below. When global 
energy and industrial CO2 emissions reach net zero, the space remaining for fossil energy emissions is 
determined by deployment of CDR options (Figure 6.21).  

This section focuses on energy systems that produce very little or no CO2 emissions, referred to in this 
chapter as net zero energy systems. While energy systems may not reach net zero concurrently with 
economy-wide CO2 or GHG emissions, they are a useful benchmark for planning a path to net zero. 
Note that the focus here is on energy systems with net zero CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
and industrial processes, but the lessons will be broadly applicable to net zero GHG energy systems as 
well.  Net-zero  GHG  energy  systems  would  incorporate  the  major  efforts  made  to  reduce  non-CO2 
emissions  (e.g.,  CH4  from  oil,  gas  and  coal  as  discussed  in  Section  6.4)  and  would  also  need  to 
incorporate more CDR to compensate for remaining non-CO2 GHG emissions. Energy sector emissions 
in many countries may not reach net zero at the same time as global energy system emissions (Figure 
6.25, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3).

zero. Residual emissions and CDR in net zero scenarios show global differences across warming levels 
(blue = &lt;1.5˚C, green = &lt;2.0˚C, orange = &gt;2.0˚C). Points represent different models and scenarios from

6.6.2  Configurations of Net-zero Energy Systems 

Net-zero  energy  systems  entail  trade-offs  across  economic,  environmental,  and  social  dimensions 
(Davis  et  al.  2018).  Many  socioeconomic,  policy,  and  market  uncertainties  will  also  influence  the 
configuration of net zero energy systems (van Vuuren et al. 2018; Krey et al. 2019; Bistline et al. 2019; 
Smith et al. 2015, Azevedo et al. 2021, Pye et al, 2021). There are reasons that countries might focus 
on one system configuration versus another, including cost, resource endowments, related industrial 
bases,  existing  infrastructure,  geography,  governance,  public  acceptance,  and  other  policy  priorities 
(Section 6.6.4 and Chapter 18 of WGII). 

Explorations of net zero energy systems have been emerging in the detailed systems modelling literature 
(Azevedo  et  al.  2021;  Bistline  2021b).  Reports  associated  with  net  zero  economy-wide  targets  for 
countries and subnational entities typically do not provide detailed roadmaps or modelling but discuss 
high-level guiding principles, though more detailed studies are emerging at national levels (Williams et 
al.  2021a;  Duan  et  al.  2021;  Capros  et  al.  2019;  Wei  et  al.  2020).  Most  analysis  has  focused  on 
identifying  potential  decarbonization  technologies  and  pathways  for  different  sectors,  enumerating 
opportunities  and  barriers  for  each,  their  costs,  highlighting  robust  insights,  and  characterizing  key 
uncertainties (Hepburn et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2018). 

The literature on the configuration of net zero energy systems is limited in a few respects. On the one 
hand, there is a robust integrated assessment literature that provides characterizations of these systems 
in broad strokes (AR6 database), offering internally consistent global scenarios to link global warming 
targets  to  regional/national  goals.  All  integrated  assessment  scenarios  that  discuss  net  zero  energy 
system  CO2  emissions  provide  high-level  characterizations  of  net  zero  systems.  Because  these 
characterizations  have less  temporal, spatial,  technological,  regulatory, and  societal  detail,  however, 
they  may  not  consider  the  complexities  that  could  ultimately  influence  regional,  national,  or  local

pathways.  High-fidelity  models  and  analyses  are  needed  to  assess  the  economic  and  environmental 
characteristics and the feasibility of many aspects of net zero or net negative emissions energy systems 
(high  confidence)  (Bistline  and  Blanford  2020;  Blanford  et  al.  2018).  For  example,  evaluating  the 
competitiveness of electricity sector technologies requires temporal, spatial, and technological detail to 
accurately represent system investments and operations (Bistline 2021c; Victoria et al. 2021; Helistoe 
et al. 2019; Collins et al. 2017; Santen et al. 2017). 

Configurations of net zero energy systems will vary by region but are likely to share several common 
characteristics (high confidence) (Figure 6.22). We focus on seven of those common characteristics in 
the remainder of this subsection.

6.6.2.1  Limited and/or Targeted Use of Fossil Fuels 

Net-zero  energy  systems  will  use  far  less  fossil  fuel  than  today  (high  confidence).  The  precise 
quantity  of  fossil  fuels  will  largely  depend  upon  the  relative  costs  of  such  fuels,  electrification, 
alternative fuels, and CDR (see Section 6.6.2.4) in the energy system (high confidence). All of these are 
affected by regional differences in resources (McGlade and Ekins 2015), existing energy infrastructure  
(Tong et al. 2019), demand for energy services, and climate and energy policies. Fossil fuel use may 
persist, for example, if and where the costs of such fuels and the compensating carbon management 
(e.g.,  CDR,  CCS)  are  less  than  non-fossil  energy.  For  most  applications,  however,  it  is  likely  that 
electrification (McCollum et al. 2014; Madeddu et al. 2020; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) or use of non-
fossil alternative fuels (Zeman and Keith 2008; Graves et al. 2011; Hänggi et al. 2019; Ueckerdt et al. 
2021)  will  prove  to  be  the  cheapest  options.  Most  residual  demand  for  fossil  fuels  is  likely  to 
predominantly be petroleum and natural gas given their high energy density (Davis et al. 2018), while 
demand for coal in net zero energy systems is likely to be very low  (Luderer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 
2020, Section 6.7.4) (high confidence).  

There is considerable flexibility regarding the overall quantity of liquid and gaseous fuels that will be 
required  in  net  zero  energy  systems  (high  confidence)  (Figure  6.22,  Section  6.7.4).  This  will  be 
determined by the relative value of such fuels as compared to systems which rely more or less heavily 
on zero-emissions electricity. In turn, the share of any fuels that are fossil or fossil-derived is uncertain 
and  will  depend  on  the  feasibility  of  CCS  and  CDR  technologies  and  long-term  sequestration  as 
compared to alternative, carbon-neutral fuels. Moreover, to the extent that physical, biological, and/or 
socio-political factors limit the availability of CDR (Smith et al. 2015; Field and Mach 2017), carbon 
management efforts may prioritize residual emissions related to land use and other non-energy sources. 

6.6.2.2  Zero or Negative CO2 Emissions from Electricity 

Net-zero energy systems will rely on decarbonized or net-negative CO2 emissions electricity systems, 
due to the many lower-cost options for producing zero-carbon electricity and the important role of end-
use electrification in decarbonizing other sectors (high confidence). 

There are many possible configurations and technologies for zero- or net-negative-emissions electricity 
systems  (high  confidence).  These  systems  could  entail  a  mix  of  variable  renewables,  dispatchable 
renewables (e.g., biomass, hydropower), other firm, dispatchable (“on-demand”) low-carbon generation 
(e.g.,  nuclear,  CCS-equipped  capacity),  energy  storage,  transmission,  carbon  removal  options  (e.g., 
BECCS, DACCS), and demand management (Bistline and Blanford 2021b; Bistline et al. 2018; Jenkins 
et al. 2018b; Luderer et al. 2017). The marginal cost of deploying electricity sector mitigation options 
increases  as  electricity  emissions  approach  zero;  in  addition,  the  most  cost-effective  mix  of  system 
resources changes as emissions approach zero and, therefore, so do the implications of electricity sector 
mitigation for sustainability and other societal goals (Cole et al. 2021; Jayadev et al. 2020; Bistline et 
al. 2018; Mileva et al. 2016; Sepulveda et al. 2018). Key factors influencing the electricity mix include 
relative costs and system benefits, local resource bases, infrastructure availability, regional integration 
and trade, co-benefits, societal preferences and other policy priorities, all of which vary by country and 
region (Section 6.6.4). Many of these factors depend on when the  net zero point is reached (Figure 
6.22).

Based  on  their  increasing  economic  competitiveness,  VRE  technologies,  especially  wind  and  solar 
power, will likely comprise large shares of many regional generation mixes (high confidence) (Figure 
6.22). While wind and solar will likely be prominent electricity resources, this does not imply that 100% 
renewable  energy systems will  be  pursued  under  all circumstances,  since  economic  and  operational 
challenges increase nonlinearly as shares approach 100% (Box 6.8) (Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Cole 
et al. 2021; Shaner et al. 2018; Frew et al. 2016; Imelda et al. 2018b). Real-world experience planning 
and  operating  regional  electricity  systems  with  high  instantaneous  and  annual  shares  of  renewable 
generation is accumulating, but debates continue about how much wind and solar should be included in 
different systems, and the cost-effectiveness of mechanisms for managing variability (Box 6.8). Either 
firm, dispatchable generation (including nuclear, CCS-equipped capacity, dispatchable renewables such 
as geothermal, and fossil units run with low capacity factors and CDR to balance emissions) or seasonal 
energy  storage  (alongside other  balancing resources discussed in  Box  6.8)  will  be  needed  to  ensure 
reliability  and  resource  adequacy  with  high  percentages  of  wind  and  solar  (Jenkins  et  al.  2018b; 
Dowling et al. 2020; Denholm et al. 2021) though each option involves uncertainty about costs, timing, 
and public acceptance (Albertus et al. 2020). 

Electricity  systems  require  a  range  of  different  functional  roles  –  for  example,  providing  energy, 
capacity, or ancillary services. As a result, a range of different types of generation, energy storage, and 
transmission resources may be deployed in these systems (Baik et al. 2021). There are many options 
for  each  of  these  roles,  each  with  their  strengths  and  weaknesses  (Sections  6.4.3  and  6.4.4),  and 
deployment of these options will be influenced by the evolution of technological costs, system benefits, 
and local resources (Veers et al. 2019; Mai et al. 2018; Bistline et al. 2018; Hirth 2015; Fell and Linn 
2013).  

System  management  is  critical  for  zero-  or  negative-emissions  electricity  systems.  Maintaining 
reliability  will  increasingly  entail system  planning  and  operations that  account  for  characteristics  of 
supply- and demand-side resources (Hu et al. 2018). Coordinated planning and operations will likely 
become  more  prevalent  across  portions  of  the  electricity  system  (e.g.,  integrated  generation, 
transmission, and distribution planning), across sectors, and across geographies (Bistline and Young 
2019; Chan et al. 2018; Konstantelos et al. 2017; EPRI 2017, Section 6.4.3). 

Energy storage will be increasingly important in net zero energy systems, especially in systems with 
shares of VRE (high confidence). Deployment of energy storage will vary based on the system benefits 
and  values  of  different  options  (Arbabzadeh  et  al.  2019;  Denholm  and  Mai  2019).  Diurnal  storage 
options  like  lithium-ion  batteries  have  different  value  than  storing  and  discharging  electricity  over 
longer periods through long-duration energy storage with less frequent cycling, which require different 
technologies, supporting policies, and business models  (Sepulveda et al. 2021; Dowling et al. 2020; 
Gallo et al. 2016; Albertus et al. 2020; Blanco and Faaij 2017) (Section 6.4.4). The value of energy 
storage varies with the level of deployment and on the competitiveness of economic complements such 
as VRE options (Bistline and Young 2020; Mileva et al. 2016) and substitutes such as flexible demand 
(Brown  et  al.  2018;  Merrick  et  al.  2018),  transmission  (Merrick  et  al.  2018;  Brown  et  al.  2018; 
Schlachtberger  et  al.  2017;  Bistline  and  Young  2019),  trade  (Bistline  et  al.  2020b),  dispatchable 
generators (Hittinger and Lueken 2015; Gils et al. 2017; Arbabzadeh et al. 2019), DAC (Daggash et al. 
2019), and efficiencies in system operations (Tuohy et al. 2015). 

The approach to other sectors could impact electricity sector planning, and the role of some technologies 
(e.g., hydrogen, batteries, CCS) could depend on deployment in other sectors. CCS offers opportunities 
for CO2 removal when fuelled with syngas or biomass containing carbon captured from the atmosphere 
(Hepburn et al. 2019); however, concerns about lifecycle environmental impacts, uncertain costs, and 
public acceptance are potential barriers to widespread deployment (Section 6.4.2). It is unclear whether 
CDR options like BECCS will be included in the electricity mix to offset continued emissions in other 
parts of the energy system or beyond (Mac Dowell et al. 2017; Luderer et al. 2018; Bauer et al. 2018a).

Some applications may also rely on PtX electricity conversion to create low-emissions synthetic fuels 
(Sections  6.6.2.6,  6.4.4,  and  6.4.5),  which  could  impact  electricity  system  planning  and  operations. 
Additionally, if DAC technologies are used, electricity and heat requirements to operate DAC could 
impact electricity system investments and operations (Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Realmonte et al. 
2019). 

[START BOX 6.8 HERE] 

Box  6.8 100% Renewables in Net Zero Energy Systems 

The  decreasing  cost  and  increasing  performance  of  renewable  energy  has  generated  interest  in  the 
feasibility of providing nearly all energy services with renewables. Renewable energy includes wind 
power, solar power, hydroelectric power, bioenergy, geothermal energy, tidal power, and ocean power. 
There  are  two  primary  frames  around  which  100%  renewable  energy  systems  are  discussed:  100% 
renewable electricity systems and 100% renewable energy systems, considering not only electricity but 
all aspects of the energy system.  

It  is  technically  feasible  to  use  very  high  renewable  shares  (e.g.,  above  75%  of  annual  regional 
generation)  to  meet  hourly  electricity  demand  under  a  range  of  conditions,  especially  when  VRE 
options,  notably  wind  and solar,  are  complemented  by  other  resources  (high  confidence).  There are 
currently  many  grids  with  high  renewable  shares  and  large  anticipated  roles  for  VRE  sources,  in 
particular wind and solar (see Section 6.4), in future low-carbon electricity systems. An increasingly 
large set of studies examines the feasibility of high renewable penetration and economic drivers under 
different policy, technology, and market scenarios (Denholm et al. 2021; Blanford et al. 2021; Bistline 
et al. 2019; Hansen et al. 2019; Jenkins et al. 2018b; Cochran et al. 2014; Dowling et al. 2020; Deason 
2018). High wind and solar penetration involves technical and economic challenges due to their unique 
characteristics  such  as  spatial  and  temporal  variability,  short-  and  long-term  uncertainty,  and  non-
synchronous  generation  (Cole  et  al.  2017).  These  challenges  become  increasingly  important  as 
renewable shares approach 100% (Sections 6.6.2.2 and 6.4.3). 

There are many balancing options in systems with very high renewables (Denholm et al. 2021; Bistline 
2021a; Mai et al. 2018; Milligan et al. 2015; Jenkins et al. 2018b). 

●  Energy  storage:  Energy  storage  technologies  like  batteries,  pumped  hydro,  and  hydrogen  can 
provide  a  range  of  system  services  (Balducci  et  al.  2018;  Bistline  et  al.  2020a;  Section  6.4.4). 
Lithium-ion batteries have received attention as costs fall and installations increase, but very high 
renewable shares typically entail either dispatchable generation or long-duration storage in addition 
to short-duration options (Schill 2020; Arbabzadeh et al. 2019; Jenkins et al. 2018b). Energy storage 
technologies are part of a broad set of options (including synchronous condensers, demand-side 
measures, and even inverter-based technologies themselves) for providing grid services (Castillo 
and Gayme 2014; EPRI 2019a). 

●  Transmission and trade: To balance differences in resource availability, high renewable systems 
will  very  likely  entail  investments  in  transmission  capacity  (Zappa  et  al.  2019;  Pleßmann  and 
Blechinger 2017; Macdonald et al. 2016; Mai and Et al 2014; Section 6.4.5) and changes in trade 
(Abrell  and  Rausch  2016;  Bistline  et  al.  2019).  These  increases  will  likely  be  accompanied  by 
expanded balancing regions to take advantage of geographical smoothing. 

●  Dispatchable (“on-demand”) generation: Dispatchable generation could include flexible fossil 
units  or  low-carbon  fuels  such  as  hydrogen  with  lower  minimum  load  levels  (Bistline  2019; 
Denholm et al. 2018), renewables like hydropower, geothermal, or biomass (Hansen et al. 2019; 
Hirth 2016), or flexible nuclear (Jenkins et al. 2018a). The composition depends on costs and other 
policy goals, though in all cases, capacity factors are low for these resources (Mills et al. 2020). 
●  Demand  management:  Many  low-emitting  and  high-renewables  systems  also  utilize  increased 
load flexibility in the forms of energy efficiency, demand response, and demand flexibility, utilizing

(Bistline 2021a; Imelda et al. 2018a; Hale 2017; Brown et al. 2018; Ameli et al. 2017).   

●  Sector  coupling:  Sector  coupling  includes  increased  end-use  electrification  and  PtX  electricity 
conversion pathways, which may entail using electricity to create synthetic fuels such as hydrogen 
(Ueckerdt et al. 2021; Davis et al. 2018) (see Sections 6.4.3, 6.4., 6.4.5, 6.6.4.3, and 6.6.4.6). 

Deployment of integration options depends on their relative costs and value, regulations, and electricity 
market  design.  There  is  considerable  uncertainty  about  future  technology  costs,  performance, 
availability, scalability, and public acceptance (Kondziella and Bruckner 2016; Bistline et al. 2019). 
Deploying  balanced  resources  likely  requires  operational,  market  design,  and  other  institutional 
changes, as well as technological changes in some cases (Denholm et al. 2021; Cochran et al. 2014). 
Mixes  will  differ  based  on  resources,  system  size,  flexibility,  and  whether  grids  are  isolated  or 
interconnected. 

Although there are no technical upper bounds on renewable electricity penetration, the economic value 
of additional wind and solar capacity typically decreases as their penetration rises, creating economic 
challenges at higher deployment levels  (Denholm et al. 2021; Millstein et al. 2021; Cole et al. 2021; 
Gowrisankaran et al. 2016; Hirth 2013). The integration options above, as well as changes to market 
design, can mitigate these challenges but likely will not solve them, especially since these options can 
exhibit declining value themselves (Denholm and Mai 2019; Bistline 2017; De Sisternes et al. 2016) 
and may be complements or substitutes to each other. 

Energy  systems  that  are  100%  renewable  (including  all  parts  of  the  energy  sector,  and  not  only 
electricity generation) raise a range of technological, regulatory, market, and operational challenges that 
make  their  competitiveness  uncertain  (high  confidence).  These  systems  require  decarbonizing  all 
electricity, using this zero-carbon electricity broadly, and then utilizing zero-carbon energy carriers for 
all  end  uses  not  served  by  electricity,  for  example,  air  travel,  long-distance  transport,  and  high-
temperature  process  heat.  Broader  questions  emerge  regarding  the  attractiveness  of  supplying  all 
energy,  and  not  just  electricity,  with  renewables  (Figure  6.22).  Integrated  assessment  and  energy 
systems research suggest large roles for renewables, but energy and electricity shares are far from 100%, 
even with stringent emissions reductions targets and optimistic assumptions about future cost reductions 
(Huntington et al. 2020; Jenkins et al. 2018b; Bauer et al. 2018; Bistline et al. 2018, Section 6.7.1). 
Scenarios  with  100%  renewable  energy  systems  are  an  emerging  subset  in  the  decarbonization 
literature,  especially  at  regional  levels  (Denholm  et  al.  2021;  Hansen  et  al.  2019).  Many  100% 
renewables studies focus more heavily on electrification for decarbonizing end uses, and include less 
biofuels and hydrogen than the broader literature on deep decarbonization (Bauer et al. 2018a). These 
studies  typically  assume  a  constrained  set  of  available  technologies  to  demonstrate  the  technical 
feasibility of very high renewable systems and do not optimize to find least-cost, technology-neutral 
decarbonization  pathways,  and  many  100%  renewables  studies  focus  on  the  electricity  sector  or  a 
limited number of sectors (Hansen et al. 2019; Jenkins et al. 2018a).  In addition to renewables, studies 
broadly agree that including additional low-carbon options – including not only low-carbon electricity 
but also targeted use of fossil fuels with and without CCS (Section 6.6.2.1) and alternative fuels for 
sectors that are difficult to electrify (Section 6.6.2.4) – can lower the cost of decarbonization even with 
very high shares of renewables (Figure 6.22). However, there is disagreement about the magnitude of 
cost savings from larger portfolios, which depend on context- and scenario-specific assumptions about 
technologies, markets, and policies.

electrification (Williams et al. 2012; Sugiyama 2012; Williams et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2015a; Sachs 
et al. 2016; Kriegler et al. 2014a; Sven et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; Schreyer et al. 2020). At least 
30%  of  the  global  final  energy  needs  are  expected  to  be  served  by  electricity,  with  some  estimates 
suggesting  upwards  of  80%  of  total  energy  use  being  electrified  (Figure  6.22,  panel  c).  Increased 
electrification is especially valuable in net zero energy systems in tandem with decarbonized electricity 
generation  or  net-negative  emissions  electricity  generation  (Section  6.5.4.2).  Flexible  electric  loads 
(electric  vehicles,  smart  appliances)  can  in  turn  facilitate  incorporation  of  VRE  electricity  options, 
increase system flexibility, and reduce needs for grid storage (Section 6.4.3) (Mathiesen et al. 2015); 
Lund et al., 2018). 

Several end-uses such as passenger transportation (light-duty electric vehicles, two and three wheelers, 
buses, rail) as well as building energy uses (lighting, cooling) are  likely to be electrified in net zero 
energy  systems  (high  confidence).  Variations  in  projections  of  electrification  largely  result  from 
differences in expectations about the ability and cost-competitiveness of electricity to serve other end 
uses such as non-rail freight transport, aviation, and heavy industry (McCollum et al. 2014; Breyer et 
al. 2019; Bataille et al. 2016; EPRI 2018) (Section 6.5.4.4), especially relative to biofuels and hydrogen 
(‘low carbon fuels’) (Sachs et al. 2016; Rockström et al. 2017; McCollum et al. 2014), the prospects for 
which are still quite uncertain (Section 6.4). The emergence of CDR technologies and the extent to 
which they allow for residual emissions as an alternative to electrification will also affect the overall 
share of energy served by electricity (Section 6.6.2.7).  

Regions endowed with cheap and plentiful low-carbon electricity resources (wind, solar, hydropower) 
are likely to emphasize electrification, while those with substantial bioenergy resources or availability 
of other liquid fuels might put less emphasis on electrification, particularly in hard-to-electrify end-uses 
(medium confidence). For example, among a group of Latin American countries, relative assumptions 
about liquid fuels and electricity result in an electrification range of 28–82% for achieving a net zero 
energy system (Bataille et al. 2020). Similarly, the level of penetration of biofuels that can substitute 
for electrification will depend on regional circumstances such as land-use constraints, competition with 
food, and sustainability of biomass production (Section 6.6.2.4). 

Electrification  of  most  buildings  services,  with  the  possible  exception  of  space  heating  in  extreme 
climates, is expected in net zero energy systems (high confidence) (Chapter 9). Space cooling and water 
heating are expected to be largely electrified. Building electrification is expected to rely substantially 
on heat pumps, which will help lower emissions both through reduced thermal requirements and higher 
efficiencies (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Rissman et al.; Sven et al. 2018). The level of electrification for 
heating  will  depend  on  the  tradeoffs  between  building  or  household  level  heat  pumps  versus  more 
centralized district heating network options (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Brown et al. 2018), as well as the 
cost  and  performance  of  heat  pumps  in  more  extreme  climates  and  grid  infrastructure  (EPRI  2018; 
Waite and Modi 2020). 

A significant share of transportation, especially road transportation, is expected to be electrified in net 
zero energy systems (high confidence). In road transportation, two-three wheelers, light-duty vehicles 
(LDVs), and buses, are especially amenable to electrification, with more than half of passenger LDVs 
expected to be electrified globally in net zero energy systems (medium confidence) ((Bataille et al. 2020; 
Sven et al. 2018; Khalili et al. 2019; Fulton et al. 2015). Long-haul trucks, large ships, and aircraft are 
expected to be harder to electrify absent technological breakthroughs (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Fulton et 
al. 2015), although continued improvements in battery technology may enable  electrification of long-
haul trucks (Nykvist and Olsson 2021; Chapter 10). Due to the relative ease of rail electrification, near 
complete electrification of rail and a shift of air and truck freight to rail is expected in net zero energy 
systems (Sven et al. 2018; Khalili et al. 2019; Rockström et al. 2017; Fulton et al. 2015). The degree of 
modal  shifts  and  electrification  will  depend  on  local  factors  such  as  infrastructure  availability  and 
location accessibility. Due to the challenges associated with electrification of some transport modes,

net zero energy systems may include some residual emissions associated with the freight sector that are 
offset  through  CDR  technologies  (Muratori  et  al.  2017b),  or  reliance  on  low  and  zero-carbon  fuels 
instead of electrification. 

A non-trivial number of industry applications could be electrified as a part of a net zero energy system, 
but direct electrification of heavy industry applications such as cement, primary steel manufacturing, 
and  chemical  feedstocks  is  expected  to  be  challenging  (medium  confidence)  (Davis  et  al.  2018; 
Madeddu et al. 2020; Philibert 2019; van Sluisveld et al. 2021). Process and boiler heating in industrial 
facilities are anticipated to be electrified in net zero energy systems. Emissions intensity reductions for 
cement  and  concrete  production  can  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  electrified  cement  kilns,  while 
emissions associated with steel production can be reduced through the use of an electric arc furnace 
(EAF)  powered  by decarbonized  electricity  (Rissman  et  al.).  Electricity can also  be  used  to replace 
thermal heat such as resistive heating, electric arc furnaces, and laser sintering (Rissman et al.; Madeddu 
et al. 2020). One study found that as much as 60% of the energy end-use in European industry could be 
met with direct electrification using existing and emerging technologies (Madeddu et al. 2020). Industry 
electrification  for  different  regions  will  depend  on  the  economics  and  availability  of  alternative 
emissions mitigation strategies such as carbon neutral fuels and CCS (Davis et al. 2018; Madeddu et al. 
2020). 

6.6.2.4  Alternative Fuels in Sectors not Amenable to Electrification 

Net-zero energy systems will need to rely on alternative fuels – notably hydrogen or biofuels – in several 
sectors that are not amenable to electricity and otherwise hard to decarbonize (medium confidence). 
Useful carbon-based fuels (e.g., methane, petroleum, methanol), hydrogen, ammonia, or alcohols can 
be produced with net zero CO2 emissions and without fossil fuel inputs (Sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.5). For 
example, liquid hydrocarbons can be synthesized via hydrogenation of non-fossil carbon by processes 
such as Fischer-Tropsch (Mac Dowell et al. 2017) or by conversion of biomass (Tilman et al. 2009). 
The resulting energy-dense fuels can serve applications that are difficult to electrify, but it is not clear 
if and when the combined costs of obtaining necessary feedstocks and producing these fuels without 
fossil inputs will be less than continuing to use fossil fuels and managing the related carbon through, 
for example, CCS or CDR (Ueckerdt et al. 2021) 

CO2 emissions from some energy services are expected to be particularly difficult to cost-effectively 
avoid, among them aviation; long-distance freight by ships; process emissions from cement and steel 
production;  high-temperature  heat  (e.g.,  &gt;1000°C);  and  electricity  reliability  in  systems  with  high 
penetration  of  variable  renewable  energy  sources  (NAS;  Davis  et  al.  2018;  Luderer  et  al.  2018; 
Chiaramonti 2019; Sepulveda et al. 2018; Bataille 2020; Rissman et al.; Thiel and Stark 2021; Madeddu 
et al. 2020). The literature focused on these services and sectors is growing, but remains limited, and 
provides minimal guidance on the most promising or attractive technological options and systems for 
avoiding these sectors’ emissions. Technological solutions do exist, but those mentioned in the literature 
are prohibitively expensive, exist only at an early stage, and/or are subject to much broader concerns 
about sustainability (e.g., biofuels) (Davis et al. 2018). 

Liquid  biofuels today  supply  about  4%  of transportation  energy  worldwide, mostly  as  ethanol from 
grain and sugar cane and biodiesel from oil seeds and waste oils (Davis et al. 2018). These biofuels 
could conceivably be targeted to difficult-to-electrify sectors, but face substantial challenges related to 
their life-cycle carbon emissions, cost, and further scalability (Tilman et al. 2009; Staples et al. 2018), 
(Section  6.4.2).  The  extent  to  which  biomass  will  supply  liquid  fuels  or  high  temperature  heat  for 
industry in a future net zero energy system will thus depend on advances in conversion technology that 
enable  use  of  feedstocks  such  as  woody  crops,  agricultural  residues,  algae,  and  wastes,  as  well  as 
competing demands for bioenergy and land, the feasibility of other sources of carbon-neutral fuels, and 
integration of bioenergy production with other objectives, including CDR, economic development, food 
security,  ecological conservation,  and  air  quality  (Lynd  2017;  Laurens  2017;  Williams and  Laurens

Muratori et al. 2020b; Chatziaras et al. 2016; Fennell et al. 2021) (Section 6.4.2.6). 

Costs are the main barrier to synthesis of net zero emissions fuels (high confidence), particularly costs 
of  hydrogen  (a  constituent  of  hydrocarbons,  ammonia,  and  alcohols)  (Section  6.4.5).  Today,  most 
hydrogen is supplied by steam reformation of fossil methane (CH4 into CO2 and H2) at a cost of 1.30-
1.50 USD kg-1 (Sherwin 2021). Non-fossil hydrogen can be obtained by electrolysis of water, at current 
costs of  5-7 USD kg-1 H2
-1 (assuming relatively low electricity costs and high utilization rates) (Graves 
et  al.  2011;  Newborough  and  Cooley  2020;  Peterson  et  al.  2020;  DOE  2020a).  At  these  costs  for 
electrolytic  hydrogen,  synthesized  net zero  emissions  fuels  would  cost  at  least 1.6  USD  per liter  of 
diesel equivalent (or 6 USD gallon-1 and 46 USD GJ-1, assuming non-fossil carbon feedstock costs of 
100 USD per ton of CO2 and low process costs of 0.05 USD liter-1 or 1.5 USD GJ-1). Similar calculations 
suggest that synthetic hydrocarbon fuels could currently avoid CO2 emissions at a cost of 936-1404 
USD ton-1 (Ueckerdt et al. 2021). However, economies of scale are expected to bring these costs down 
substantially in the future (Ueckerdt et al. 2021; IRENA 2020c), and R&amp;D efforts are targeting 60-80% 
reductions  in  costs  (to  less  than  2  USD  kg-1  (H2)-1)  possibly  by  use  of  less  mature  but  promising 
technologies such as high-temperature electrolysis and thermochemical water splitting (Schmidt et al. 
2017;  Pes  et  al.  2017;  DOE  2018;  Saba  et  al.  2018;  Kuckshinrichs  et  al.  2017;  DOE  2020b). 
Technologies capable of producing hydrogen directly from water and sunlight (photoelectrochemical 
cells or photocatalysts) are also under development, but still at an early stage (DOE 2020a; Nielander 
et al. 2015). High hydrogen production efficiencies have been demonstrated, but costs, capacity factors, 
and lifetimes need to be improved in order to make such technologies feasible for net zero emissions 
fuel production at scale (DOE 2020a; Newborough and Cooley 2020; McKone et al. 2014). 

The carbon contained in net zero emissions hydrocarbons must have been removed from the atmosphere 
either through DAC, or, in the case of biofuels, by photosynthesis (which could include CO2 captured 
from the exhaust of biomass or biogas combustion)  (Zeman and Keith 2008; Graves et al. 2011). A 
number of different groups are now developing DAC technologies, targeting costs of 100 USD per ton 
of CO2 or less (Darton and Yang 2018; Keith et al. 2018; Fasihi et al. 2019).

Box  6.9 The Hydrogen Economy 

The phrase “hydrogen economy” is often used to describe future energy systems in which hydrogen 
plays  a  prominent role.  These future  energy  systems would  not  use  hydrogen for  all  end  uses; they 
would use hydrogen to complement other energy carriers, mainly electricity, where hydrogen might 
have advantages. Hydrogen could provide long-term electricity storage to support high-penetration of 
intermittent renewables and could enable trading and storage of electricity between different regions to 
overcome seasonal or production capability differences (Dowling et al. 2020; Sepulveda et al. 2021). It 
could also  be  used  in  lieu of  natural  gas for  peaking generation, provide process  heat  for industrial 
needs, or be used in the metal sector via direct reduction of iron ore (Chapter 11). Clean hydrogen could 
be  used  as  a  feedstock  in  the  production  of  various  chemicals  and  synthetic  hydrocarbons.  Finally, 
hydrogen-based  fuel  cells  could  power  vehicles.  Recent  advances  in  battery  storage  make  electric 
vehicles the most attractive alternative for light-duty transport. However, fuel cell technology could 
complement electric vehicles in supporting the decarbonisation of heavy-duty transport segments (e.g., 
trucks, buses, ships, and trains) (Chapter 10). 

Hydrogen production costs have historically been prohibitive, but recent technological developments 
are  bringing  costs  down.  These  developments  include  improvements  in  hydrogen  production 
technologies in terms of efficiency and capital costs (e.g., SMR) (Alrashed and Zahid 2021; Boretti and 
Banik 2021) and the emergence of alternative production technologies such as electrolysers (Dawood 
et  al.  2020).  These  technological  changes,  along  with  decreasing  costs  of  renewable  power,  are 
increasing  the  viability  of  hydrogen.  Other  improvements  in  hydrogen-based  technologies  are  also 
emerging quickly. Gas turbines now run on blended fuels containing 5-95% hydrogen by volume (GE 
2020) and could operate entirely on hydrogen by 2030 (Pflug et al. 2019). Fuel cell costs have decreased 
by 80-95% since the early 2000s, while power density and durability have improved (Kurtz et al. 2019; 
IEA 2019e; Jouin et al. 2016). 

For hydrogen to support decarbonisation, it will need to be produced from zero-carbon or extremely 
low-carbon  energy  sources.  One  such  production  category  is  “green  hydrogen.”  While  there  is  no 
unified definition for green hydrogen, it can be produced by the electrolysis of water using electricity 
generated  without  carbon  emissions  (such  as  renewables).  Hydrogen  can  also  be  produced  through 
biomass gasification with CCS (BECCS), leading to negative carbon emissions (del Pozo et al. 2021). 
Additionally, “blue hydrogen” can be produced from natural gas through the process of auto-thermal 
reforming  (ATR)  or  steam  methane  reforming  (SMR),  combined  with  CCS  technology  that  would 
absorb most of the resulting CO2 (80-90%).  

However, the potential role of hydrogen in future energy systems depends on more than just production 
methods  and  costs.  For  some  applications,  the  competitiveness  of  hydrogen  also  depends  on  the 
availability of the infrastructure needed to transport and deliver it at relevant scales (Lee et al. 2021). 
Transporting hydrogen through existing gas pipelines is generally not feasible without changes to the 
infrastructure itself (Muratori et al. 2018; Gumber and Gurumoorthy 2018). Existing physical barriers, 
such as steel embrittlement and degradation of seals, reinforcements in compressor stations, and valves, 
require  retrofitting  during  the  conversion  to  H2  distribution  or  new  H2  dedicated  pipelines  to  be 
constructed  (Dohi  et  al.  2016).  The  capacity  to  leverage  and  convert  existing  gas  infrastructure  to 
transport  hydrogen  will  vary  regionally,  but  in  many  cases  could  be  the  most  economically  viable 
pathway (Brändle et al. 2021; Cerniauskas et al. 2020; Brooks 2021; Wettengel 2021).  Hydrogen could 
also be transported as liquid gas or as liquid organic hydrogen carriers such as ammonia, for which 
industry  knowledge  exists  (Hong  et  al.  2021;  Wulf  et  al.  2018;  Demir  et  al.  2018).  Additionally, 
improvements  in  fuel  cell  technologies  are  needed  to  make  hydrogen-based  transport  economically

viable. There are also safety concerns associated with the flammability (Nilsson et al. 2017) and storage 
(Andersson and Grönkvist 2019; Caglayan et al. 2019) of hydrogen which will need to be considered. 

[END BOX 6.9 HERE] 

6.6.2.5  Using Less Energy and Using It More Efficiently 

Demand-side or demand reduction strategies include technology efficiency improvements, strategies 
that reduce energy consumption or demand for energy services (such as reducing the use of personal 
transportation,  often  called  “conservation”)  (Creutzig  et  al.  2018),  and  strategies  such  as  load 
curtailment. 

Net-zero energy systems will use energy more efficiently than those of today (high confidence). Energy 
efficiency  and  energy  use  reduction  strategies  are  generally  identified  as  being  flexible  and  cost-
effective, with the potential for large scale deployment (Chapters 5, 9, 10, and 11). For this reason, 
existing  studies  find  that  energy  efficiency  and  demand  reduction  strategies  will  be  important 
contributors to net zero energy systems (Creutzig et al. 2018; Davis et al. 2018; DeAngelo et al. 2021). 
Lower demand reduces the need for low-carbon energy or alternative fuel sources. 

Characterizing  efficiency  of  net zero  energy  systems is  problematic  due  to measurement  challenges 
(high confidence). Efficiency itself is difficult to define and measure across full economies (Saunders 
et al. 2021). There is no single definition of energy efficiency and the definition understandably depends 
on  the  context  used  (Patterson  1996),  which  ranges  from  device  level  efficiency  all  the  way  to  the 
efficient use of energy throughout an economy. Broadly, energy efficient strategies allow for the same 
level of services or output while using less energy. At the level of the entire economy, measures such 
as primary or final energy per capita or per GDP are often used as a proxy for energy efficiency, but 
these  measures  reflect  not  only  efficiency,  but  also  many  other  factors  such  as  industrial  structure, 
endowed  natural  resources,  consumer  preferences,  policies,  and  regulations.  Energy  efficiency  and 
other demand-side strategies represent such a large set of technologies, strategies, policies, market and 
consumers’ responses and policies that aggregate measures can be difficult to define (Saunders et al. 
2021).  

Measurement issues notwithstanding, virtually all studies that address net zero energy systems assume 
improved  energy  intensity  in  the  future  (high  confidence).  The  overall  efficiency  outcomes  and  the 
access to such improvements across different nations, however, is not clear. Energy consumption will 
increase over time despite energy efficiency improvements due to population growth and development 
(DeAngelo et al. 2021).  

A study (DeAngelo et al. 2021) reviewed 153 IAM scenarios that attain net zero energy sector CO2 
emissions and found that, under a scenario with net zero emissions: global final energy per capita lies 
between 21–109 GJ per person (median: 57), in comparison to 2018 global final energy use of 55 GJ 
per person; many countries use far more energy per capita than today as their incomes increase; global 
final energy use per unit of economic output ranges from 0.7–2.2 EJ per trillion USD (median: 1.5), in 
comparison to 5 EJ per trillion USD in 2018; and the median final energy consumption is 529 EJ. By 
comparison,  final  energy  consumption  would  be  550  EJ  if  current  energy  consumption  per  capita 
continued  under  a  future  population  of  10  billion  people.  Across  all  scenarios,  total  final  energy 
consumption is higher today than in the year in which net zero emissions are attained, and regionally, 
only the OECD+EU and Eurasia have lower median total final energy than in 2010.  

Net-zero energy systems will be characterized by greater efficiency and more efficient use of energy 
across all sectors (high confidence). Road transportation efficiency improvements will require a shift 
from liquid fuels (Chapters 5 and 10). Emissions reductions will come from a transition to electricity, 
hydrogen,  or  synthetic  fuels  produced  with  low  carbon  energy  sources  or  processes.  Vehicle

last mile delivery with drones may result in increased service share. Lighter vehicles, a shift to public 
transit, and incorporation of 2- and 3-wheelers will be features of a net zero energy system (Chapter 
10). Teleworking and automation of work may provide reductions in driving needs. Other sectors, such 
as air travel and marine transportation may rely on alternative fuels such as biofuels, synthetic fuels, 
ammonia, produced with zero carbon energy source (Section 6.6.2.4).   

Under net zero energy systems, buildings would by characterized by improved construction materials, 
an increase in multi-family dwellings, early retirement of inefficient buildings, smaller floor areas, and 
smart controls to optimize energy use in the building, namely for heating, cooling, LED lighting, and 
water heating (Chapter 9). End-uses would utilize electricity, or potentially hydrogen, produced from 
zero carbon sources. The use of electricity for heating and cooking may often be a less efficient process 
at converting primary energy to energy services than using natural gas, but using natural gas would 
require CDR in order to be considered net zero emissions. Changes in behaviour may modestly lower 
demand.  Most  economies  would  have  buildings  with  more  efficient  technologies  powered  by  zero 
carbon  electricity,  and  developing  economics  would  shift  from  biomass  to  electricity,  raising  their 
energy consumption as population and wealth increase under net zero energy systems.  

Industry has seen major efficiency improvements in the past, but many processes are now close to their 
thermodynamic  limits.  Electrification  and  breakthrough  processes  (such  as  producing  steel  with 
electricity  and  H2),  using  recycled  materials,  using  heat  more  efficiently  by  improving  thermal 
insulation,  and  using  waste  heat  for  heat  pumps,  as  well  using  advanced  sensors,  monitoring,  and 
visualization and communication technologies may provide further efficiency improvements. (Chapter 
11) 

6.6.2.6  Greater Reliance on Integrated Energy System Approaches 

Energy  systems  integration  refers  to  connected  planning  and  operations  across  energy  carriers, 
including electricity, fuels, and thermal resources. Coordinated planning could be important in lowering 
system costs, increasing reliability, minimizing environmental impacts, and ensuring that costs of R&amp;D 
and infrastructure account for not just current needs but also for those of future energy systems (Section 
6.4.3).  Integration  includes  not  only  the  physical  energy  systems  themselves  but  also  simultaneous 
societal objectives (e.g., sustainable development goals), innovation processes (e.g., coordinating R&amp;D 
to  increase  the  likelihood  of  beneficial  technological  spillovers),  and  other  institutional  and 
infrastructural transformations (Sachs et al. 2019). Given system variability and differences in regional 
resources,  there  are  economic  and  technical  advantages  to  greater  coordination  of  investments  and 
policies  across  jurisdictions,  sectors,  and  levels  of  government  (Schmalensee  and  Stavins  2017). 
Coordinated planning and operations can improve system economics by sharing resources, increasing 
the utilization of capital-intensive assets, enhancing the geographical diversity of resource bases, and 
smoothing demand. But integration could require regulatory and market frameworks to facilitate and 
appropriate price signals to align incentives and to coordinate investments and operations. 

Carbon-neutral  energy  systems  are  likely  to  be  more  interconnected  than  those  of  today  (high 
confidence).  The  many  possible  feedstocks,  energy  carriers,  and  interconversion  processes  imply  a 
greater need for the integration of production, transport, storage, and consumption of different fuels 
(Davis et al. 2018). For instance, electrification is expected to play an important role in decarbonizing 
light-duty vehicles (Chapter 10, Section 6.4.3), yet the electricity and transport sectors have few direct 
interactions today. Systems integration and sectoral coupling are increasingly relevant to ensure that net 
zero energy systems are reliable, resilient, and affordable (EPRI 2017; O’Malley et al. 2020; Buttler 
and Spliethoff 2018; Martin et al. 2017). Deep decarbonization offers new opportunities and challenges 
for integrating different sectors as well as supply- and demand-side options. For instance, increasing 
electrification will change daily and seasonal load shapes, and end-use flexibilities and constraints could 
impact  the  desirability  of  different  supply-side  technologies  (EPRI  2019b;  Brown  et  al.  2018).  The 
feasibility  of  net  zero  energy  system  configurations  could  depend  on  demonstrating  cross-sector

benefits like balancing VRE sources in the electricity sector, and on offering the flexibility to produce 
multiple  products.  For  instance,  low-emissions  synthetic  fuels  could  help  to  bridge  stationary  and 
mobile applications, since fuel markets have more flexibility than instantaneously balanced electricity 
markets due to the comparative ease and cost of large-scale, long-term storage of chemical fuels (Davis 
et al. 2018). 

There are few detailed archetypes of integrated energy systems that provide services with zero- or net-
negative  CO2  emissions (such  as  (Jacobson et  al.  2019)), so  there is  considerable  uncertainty  about 
integration and interactions across parts of the system. Although alternate configurations, tradeoffs, and 
pathways are still being identified, common elements include fuels and processes like zero- or negative-
CO2 electricity generation and transmission, hydrogen production and transport, synthetic hydrocarbon 
production and transport, ammonia production and transport, and carbon management, where linkages 
across pathways could include the use of electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis (Davis et al. 
2018; Jenkins et al. 2018b; van Vuuren et al. 2018; Shih et al. 2018; Moore 2017; Smith et al. 2016). 
Linked  analytical  frameworks  are  increasing  being  used  to  understand  the  potential  role  for  system 
coupling with greater temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and heterogeneity of consumer and firm 
decisions (Pye et al. 2021; Gerboni et al. 2017; Santen et al. 2017; Collins et al. 2017; Bistline and de 
la Chesnaye 2017; Bohringer and Rutherford 2008). 

Challenges associated with integrating net zero energy systems include rapid technological change, the 
importance of behavioural dimensions in domains with limited experience and data, policy changes and 
interactions, and path dependence. Technological cost and public acceptance will influence the degree 
of  integration.  Sectoral  pathways  will  likely  be  adaptive  and  adjust  based  on  the  resolution  of 
uncertainties  over  time,  and  the  relative  competitiveness  will  evolve  as  the  technological  frontier 
evolves,  which  is  a  complex  and  path-dependent  function  of  deployment,  R&amp;D,  and  inter-industry 
spillovers. Supply-side options interact with demand-side measures in increasingly integrated energy 
systems (van Vuuren et al. 2018; Sorrell 2015). 

6.6.2.7  Carbon Dioxide Removal 

While CDR is likely necessary for net zero energy systems, the scale and mix of strategies is unclear –
nonetheless some combination of BECCS and DACCS are likely to be part of net zero energy systems 
(high  confidence).  Studies  indicate  that  energy-sector  CDR  may  potentially  remove  5–12  GtCO2 
annually globally in net zero energy systems (Fuss et al. 2018) (Figure 6.22; Section 6.7; Chapter 12). 
CDR is not intended as a replacement for emissions reduction, but rather as a complementary effort to 
offset residual emissions from sectors that are not decarbonized and from other low-carbon technologies 
such as fossil CCS (McLaren et al. 2019; Gaffney et al. 2020; Iyer et al. 2021).  

CDR covers a broad set of methods and implementation options (Chapters 7 and 12). The two CDR 
methods most relevant to the energy sector are BECCS, which is used to produce energy carriers, and 
DACCS which is an energy user (Smith et al. 2016; Singh and Colosi 2021). BECCS has value as an 
electricity generation technology, providing firm, dispatchable power to support electricity grids with 
large  amounts  of  VRE  sources,  and  reducing  the  reliance  on  other  means  to  manage  these  grids, 
including electricity storage (Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Mac Dowell et al. 2017). BECCS may also 
be used to produce liquid fuels or gaseous fuels, including hydrogen (Section 6.4.2.6) (Muratori et al. 
-1 (Sanchez et al. 
2020b). For instance, CO2 from bio-refineries could be captured at &lt;45 USD tCO2
2018). Similarly, while CO2 capture is expensive, its integration with hydrogen via biomass gasification 
can be achieved at an incremental capital cost of 3-35% ((Muratori et al. 2020b); Section 6.4). As with 
all uses of bioenergy, linkages to broad sustainability concerns may limit the viable development, as 
will the presence of high-quality geologic sinks in close proximity (Melara et al. 2020). 

DACCS offers a modular approach to CDR (Creutzig et al. 2019), but it could be a significant consumer 
of energy. DAC could also interact with other elements of the energy systems as the captured CO2 could

be reused to produce low-carbon methanol and other fuels (Realmonte et al. 2019; Hoppe et al. 2018; 
Zhang and Fujimori 2020). DACCS might also offer an alternative for use of excess electricity produced 
by  variable  renewables  (Wohland  et  al.  2018),  though  there  are  uncertainties  about  the  economic 
performance of this integrated approach. 

6.6.3  The Institutional and Societal Characteristics of Net-zero Energy Systems  

The  transition  to  net  zero  energy  systems  is  not  just  technological;  it  requires  shifts  in  institutions, 
organizations, and society more generally. As such, it involves institutional changes alongside changes 
in supply, technology, or markets  (Andrews-Speed 2016, Pai et al. 2021). Institutional relationships 
between governments and energy sector actors (e.g., consumers, electricity companies) affect the nature 
of  net  zero  systems,  as  these  entities  may  collaborate  on  or  dispute  net  zero  goals  and measures  to 
achieve them. For example, following the Fukushima disaster, Japan placed emphasis on government-
utility-public cooperation on use of nuclear power as a means of reducing carbon emissions (Sklarew 
2018). Institutions are instrumental in shaping net zero energy systems in multiple ways, complemented 
by and interacting with the behaviours of actors and policy regimes in these systems (Figure 6.24).  

Figure 6.24 A four-level framework for institutional change. The diagram depicts three levels of 
institutions (1-3) which collectively govern actor behaviours (4). Source: Andrews-Speed 2016 

One  level  of  institutional  interactions  reflects  embedded  institutions,  norms,  beliefs,  and  ideas  that 
would need to change to support net zero energy systems. This applies, for example, to the objectives 
of modern economies and the potentially contradictory dynamics embedded in the concept of “green 
growth”  (Stegemann  and  Ossewaarde  2018;  Stoknes  and  Rockström  2018).  The  institutional 
environment – the political and legal systems that govern exchanges and protect property rights – would 
also need to be different in net zero energy systems. In this setting, changing regulations or subsidies 
that  continue  to  favour  carbon-intensive  systems  over  the  technologies  of  a  net  zero  energy  system 
might  prove  difficult  (Sovacool  2017).  More  generally,  net  zero  energy  systems  will  need  new 
regulatory  frameworks  to  undertake  new  challenges,  from  managing  a  more  interconnected  grid  to 
adequately governing underground storage of CO2. Institutions may also govern specific transactions, 
such as firms or networks that supply energy fuels or services. Current actors are typically resistant to 
disruptions, even if such disruptions may broadly benefit society (Kungl 2015, Mori 2018, Schmid et 
al. 2017).

For example, one energy system characterized by differentiated institutional interactions is the United 
States, where delivery of liquid fuels is lightly regulated, while electricity delivery is closely regulated 
(Dworkin et al. 2013). Reforming this two-pronged system for decarbonization would require four types 
of institutional change: (1) changes to the control systems that coordinate generation and transmission 
through a pyramidal architecture for the operational control, dispatch, and delivery of electricity with a 
primary emphasis on reliability; (2) changes to the financing of central-station power plants through 
long-term bonds, as valued by Wall Street ratings analysts; (3) changes to the structure of investor-
owned utilities that attract private investors who expected decades of technological stability to yield 
long-term, low-risk revenues; and (4) changes to regulations to restructure and limit excessive returns 
and easy entry of new retail competitors, all recognizing local and national concerns through state and 
federal regulatory agencies. The example shows how decision-making and the infrastructures involved 
are  layered,  and  can  create  “nested  hierarchies”  where  institutions  fulfill  multiple  roles  for  energy 
governance or regulation simultaneously (Stern et al. 2016b).  Internationally and across different parts 
of the energy system, institutional challenges such as these could become even more stark and complex 
(Van de Graaf 2013). 

6.6.4  Regional Circumstances and Net-zero Energy Systems 

Countries have flexibility to pursue options that make the most sense for their national circumstances 
(Figure  6.25).  They  may  emphasize  supply  transformation  over  demand  reduction;  deploy  different 
resources; engage at different levels in international energy trade; support different energy industries; 
focus on different energy carriers (e.g., electricity, hydrogen); or focus more on distributed or integrated 
systems,  among  others.  Many  factors may influence the long-term  net  zero energy  systems that  are 
appropriate for any country’s national circumstances, including the following. 

Future Technology. Technological transitions have often been driven by the relative merits of different 
technology options. Recent trends in the use of PV cells, wind power, and in batteries, for example, 
have been spurred by their increasing economic competitiveness (Section 6.3). Yet future technology 
cannot be fully predicted, so it provides only a partial guide today for charting a path toward future 
systems. 

Indigenous Energy Resources. Countries may emphasize approaches that take advantage of indigenous 
energy resources such  as  solar  power,  wind,  hydroelectric  resources, land  for  bioenergy crops,  CO2 
storage capability, or fossil resources to be used with CCS. Countries with less abundant resources may 
put greater emphasis on demand reductions and regional integration. Countries with resource bases that 
are easily tradeable, like low-carbon electricity or bioenergy, may choose to trade those resources rather 
than use them domestically (Box 6.10, Section 6.4.3, 6.4.5). 

Regional Climate. Climate influences heating and cooling demand, both of which influence countries’ 
energy demands and energy infrastructure to meet those demands (Section 6.5). In addition to daily 
demand profiles, heating and cooling are seasonal, influencing which energy sources may serve these 
loads and the seasonal storage they require. Cooling is almost entirely served by electricity today, and 
heating has commonly been served by non-electric fuels. In low-carbon energy systems, heating may 
be increasingly served by electricity (Section 6.6.4), meaning that the influence of regional climate may 
be strongest on countries’ electricity systems.  

Current Energy System Configuration. Future sectoral energy demands and the potential for demand-
side transformation are partially determined by existing infrastructure (e.g., building stocks, transport 
infrastructure). Countries with less developed or growing energy systems will have more flexibility to 
create  the  systems  that  best match their  long-term goals,  but  there may be substantial  challenges in 
transitioning  directly to the  most  advanced  low-carbon  technology options,  and  countries may  have 
different capacities to absorb technology from other countries.

Regional Integration. Regional integration will allow countries to bridge energy gaps using external 
linkages,  including  regional  electricity  integration  and  trade  in  hydrogen,  biomass,  and  other  fuels. 
Countries  with  greater  integration  can  rely more  heavily  on  imports  and  may  therefore  rely  less  on 
indigenous resources (Box 6.10).

emissions reach net zero. Regional differences are shown for residual emissions and carbon removal 
(panel a), energy resources (panel b), electrification (panel c), and energy intensity (panel d). 
Distributions of scenarios are shown along each axis for each region. Colour scheme is shown in panel a. 
Points represent different models and scenarios from the AR6 database. 

Societal Preferences. Citizens in every country have preferences for certain technological options or 
mitigation  approaches  over  others  that  will  influence  energy  system  choices.  The  public  generally 
prefers  a  future  energy  system  based  largely  on  renewables.  Preferences  for  non-renewable  energy 
differ across regions and groups. For example, studies have found that people in the U.K., Germany, 
the Netherlands, and Switzerland prefer renewable energy and personal energy efficiency and savings

to nuclear, fossil fuels and CCS (Demski et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2012; Scheer et al. 2013; Volken et al. 
2018; Bessette and Arvai 2018; Steg 2018). Studies have found that people with higher education levels, 
higher incomes, females, and liberals prefer renewables to fossil fuels and nuclear (Van Rijnsoever et 
al. 2015; Bertsch et al. 2016; Blumer et al. 2018; Jobin et al. 2019). The willingness to pay for renewable 
electricity differs by source (Ma et al. 2015; Sundt and Rehdanz 2015).  

Technological  Leadership,  Economic  Opportunities,  and  Growth.  Countries  may  emphasize 
technologies in which they intend to have technological leadership and a competitive advantage. These 
could emerge over time or be based on current areas of opportunity or leadership. Industrial policy will 
influence  future  energy  system  as  technological  choices  can  benefit  or  hamper  incumbents  or  new 
market actors. 

Energy Security. Countries emphasizing import security will tend to rely more heavily on indigenous 
resources  (Section  6.3).  Some  indigenous  resources  may  raise  security  of  supply  issues  that  will 
influence  energy  system configurations.  Bioenergy  and  hydropower, for  example,  can  be  subject  to 
import climate risks (6.5), and significant integration of VRE technologies will  influence electricity 
system infrastructure and management (6.6.2, Box 6.8). 

Other Factors. Countries will consider a wide range of  other factors in building toward low-carbon 
energy  systems.  Population  density,  for  example,  will  influence  building  and  transportation  energy 
demands;  economic  transitions  will  influence  industrial  energy  demands.  Societal  priorities  beyond 
climate, notably SDGs may influence technology choices and types of energy systems (Sections 6.3 
and 6.7.7). 

[START BOX 6.10 HERE] 

Box  6.10 Regional Integration of Energy Systems 

Energy systems are linked across countries in many ways: countries transport crude oil across the ocean 
in supertankers, pipelines carry oil and natural gas across country boundaries, electric power lines cross 
country boundaries, and countries trade industrial commodities that carry embodied energy or that are 
essential  inputs  to  mitigation  technologies.  Future  systems  will  generate  electricity  using  different 
mixes of technologies, produce and transport different carriers (e.g., hydrogen or biofuels), and use far 
less  fossil  fuel,  among  other  major  changes.  Important  examples  include  electricity,  hydrogen,  and 
biomass.  

Electricity  System  Integration.  Net-zero  energy  systems  will  rely  more  heavily  on  electricity 
generated  from  low-emissions  technologies.  Given  the  significant  variations  in  the  location  of  low-
carbon electricity resources and the temporal variability of some renewable electricity sources, notably 
solar and wind power, regional electricity grids could reduce overall costs of net zero energy systems 
(Section 6.4.5). Furthermore, electricity transmission interconnections could significantly reduce local 
energy  balancing  costs  and  investment  in  peaking  plants  needed  to  meet  security  of  supply 
requirements, and it could increase system resilience, especially in the case of extreme events such as 
heat  waves  or  cold  spells  (Fasihi  and  Bogdanov  2016).  Important  challenges  to  regional  electricity 
integration  include  geopolitical  concerns  from  cross-border  trade  and  societal  and  technological 
challenges associated with building new transmission lines. 

Hydrogen Trade. Hydrogen may play an important role in future net zero energy systems, particularly 
in applications where electricity is not economically advantageous (see Box 6.9). Hydrogen can be used 
to decarbonize regions in which it is produced, and it can also be transported long distances to facilitate 
decarbonization of sectors distant from sources of low-cost supply. Methods of long-distance, high-
volume hydrogen transport could include liquid storage, chemical carriers, and gaseous delivery via 
pipelines  (Section  6.4.5).  In  net  zero  systems  with  substantial  wind  and  solar  power  generation,

hydrogen  can  be  generated  through  electrolysis  and  then  shipped  to  other  locations.  Important 
challenges  to  hydrogen  trade  include  cost-effective  low  carbon  production,  cost  of  delivery 
infrastructure, storage, and end-use technology costs and safety.  

Trade in Biomass. Biomass may also play an important role in net zero energy systems (Section 6.6.4, 
Chapter 3). Large-scale bioenergy production and consumption is likely to trigger global biomass trade. 
Global bioenergy trade volumes presently exceed 1 EJ yr-1, of which 60% is directly traded for energy 
purposes  (Proskurina  et  al.  2019b).  Established  trade  mechanisms  include  wood  pellet  transport, 
ethanol, and biodiesel (Proskurina et al. 2019a). In a net zero global energy system, bioenergy trade 
could be greater than current trade of coal or natural gas, but less than that of petroleum (Sharmina et 
al. 2017) (Mandley et al, 2020). Some studies indicate that Latin America and Africa could become key 
exporting regions, with the EU, the USA, and East Asia emerging as key importers (Rentizelas et al. 
2019; Alsaleh and Abdul-Rahim 2018). Studies have found that net bioenergy exports could be as high 
as 10% of GDP for some Latin American countries, while other regions like the EU may be faced with 
burgeoning import reliance (Mahlknecht et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2020b). In addition to challenges 
associated with bioenergy production (Section 6.4, Chapter 7), important challenges to biomass trade 
include differences in sustainability criteria and land/biomass definitions in different jurisdictions, and 
difficulties in establishing consistent monitoring and auditing systems (Lamers et al, 2016).

Term 

6.7.1  Low-Carbon Energy System Transition Pathways 

6.7.1.1  Energy System Emissions 

Without additional efforts to reduce emissions, it is very unlikely that energy system CO2 emissions 
will decrease sufficiently to limit warming to well below 2°C (high confidence). Scenarios assuming 
improvements in technology but no additional climate policies beyond those in place today provide a 
benchmark for comparison against energy-related CO2 emissions in mitigation scenarios (Figure 6.26). 
Emissions in these reference scenarios increase through 2050 but span a broad range (Chapter 3 Figure 
3.16;  Riahi  et  al.  2017; Wei  et  al.  2018).  The  highest  emissions levels are  about  four times  current 
emissions; the lowest are modestly below today’s emissions. Emissions in these scenarios increase in 
most regions, but they diverge significantly across regions (Bauer et al. 2017). Asia and the Middle East 
and Africa account for the majority of increased emissions across these scenarios (Figure 6.27). While 
it is unlikely that there will be no new climate policies in the future, these scenarios nonetheless support 
the conclusion that the energy sector will not be decarbonized without explicit policy actions to reduce 
emissions.  

Warming cannot be limited to well below 2°C without rapid and deep reductions in energy system GHG 
emissions (high confidence). Energy sector CO2 emissions fall by 87-97% (interquartile range) by 2050 
in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and 60-79% in scenarios limiting 
likely warming to 2°C (Figure 6.26). Energy sector GHG emissions fall by 85-95% (interquartile range) 
in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and 62-78% in scenarios limiting 
likely warming to 2°C (Figure 6.26). In 2030, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot, net CO2 and GHG emissions fall by 35-51% and 38-52% respectively. Key characteristics 
of emissions pathways – the year of peak emissions, the year when net emissions reach zero, and the 
pace of emissions reductions – vary widely across countries and regions. These differences arise from

carbon sinks (Schreyer et al. 2020)(Schaeffer, et al.2020; Schreyer, et al., 2020; van Soest, Heleen, et 
al., 2021;Figure 6.27, Figure 6.28, Box 6.11). If countries do not move quickly to reduce emissions – if 
reductions are delayed – a more rapid energy transition will subsequently be required to limit warming 
to 2°C or below (Rogelj et al. 2015a, 2018a; IPCC 2018).

Figure 6.28 The timing of net zero emissions for full economy GHGs, energy sector CO2, and electricity 
sector CO2. Boxes indicate 25th and 75th percentiles, centre black line is the median, while whiskers 
indicate 1.5x the inter-quartile range. The vertical dashed lines represent the median point at which 
emissions in the scenarios have dropped by 95% (pink) and 97.5% (purple), respectively. Dots represent 
individual scenarios. The fraction indicates the number of scenarios reaching net zero by 2100 out of the 
total sample. (Source: AR6 Scenario Database) 

The  timing  of  net  zero  energy  system  emissions  varies  substantially  across  scenarios.  In  scenarios 
limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (likely below 2°C), the energy system reaches 
net zero CO2 emissions (interquartile range) from 2060 onwards (2080-). (Figure 6.28). However, net 
emissions reach near-zero more quickly. For example, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5C with no 
or limited overshoot (likely below 2C) net energy system CO2 emissions drop by 95% between 2056 
and 2075 (2073 and 2093). Net full economy GHG emissions reach zero more slowly than net CO2 
emissions. In some scenarios, net energy system CO2 and total GHG emissions do not reach zero this 
century, offset by CDR in other sectors. 

The  timing of emissions  reductions  will  vary across the  different  parts  of the energy sector  (Figure 
6.28). To decarbonize most cost-effectively, global net CO2 emissions from electricity generation will 
likely  reach  zero  before  the  rest  of  the  energy  sector  (medium  confidence).  In  scenarios  limiting 
warming to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot (likely below 2C), net electricity sector CO2 emissions 
(interquartile range) reach zero globally between 2044 and 2055 (2052 and 2078) (Figure 6.28). It is 
likely to be less-costly to reduce net CO2 emissions close to or below zero in the electricity sector than 
in other sectors, because there are relatively more low-emissions options in electricity. Sectors such as 
long-distance  transport,  air  transport,  and  process  heat  are  anticipated  to  face  greater  challenges  to 
decarbonization than the electricity sector (Rogelj et al. 2018b, 2015b; Clark and Herzog 2014; IPCC 
2018; Luderer et al. 2018). 

In addition, there are potential options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere in the electricity sector, 
notably  BECCS,  which  would  allow  electricity  sector  emissions  to  drop  below  zero.  Without  CDR 
options, electricity sector emissions may not fall all the way to zero. If CDR is accomplished in other 
sectors and not in electricity, some fossil fuel plants may still lead to positive net electricity sector CO2 
emissions even in net zero economies (Williams et al. 2021a; Bistline and Blanford 2021b)

We lack sufficient understanding to pin down precise dates at which energy system CO2 emissions in 
individual countries, regions, or sectors will reach net zero. Net-zero timing is based on many factors 
that are not known today or are bound up in development of key technologies, such as energy storage, 
bioenergy,  or  hydrogen.  Some  countries  have  low-carbon  resource  bases  that  could  support  deep 
emissions reductions, while others do not. Timing is also affected by the availability of CDR options, 
whether  these  options  are  in  the  energy  sector  or  elsewhere,  and  the  discount  rate  used  to  assess 
strategies (Bednar et al. 2019; Emmerling et al. 2019). Moreover, while many scenarios are designed 
to minimize global mitigation costs, many other frameworks exist for allocating mitigation effort across 
countries (Chapter 4; van den Berg, N. J., et al., 2019).

6.7.1.2  Low-carbon energy transition strategies  

There are multiple technological routes to reduce energy system emissions (see Section 6.6). Here we 
discuss three of these: (1) decarbonizing primary energy and electricity generation, (2) switching to 
electricity, bioenergy, hydrogen, and other fuels produced from low-carbon sources, and (3) limiting 
energy use through improvement of efficiency and conservation. CDR is discussed in Section 6.7.1.X; 
Fossil fuel transitions are discussed in Section 6.7.4. 

Decarbonizing Primary Energy and Electricity Generation. Limiting warming to well below 2°C 
requires  a  rapid  and  dramatic  increase  in  energy  produced  from  low-  or  zero-carbon  sources  (high 
confidence).  Low-  and  zero-carbon  technologies  produce  74-82%  (interquartile  range)  of  primary 
energy in 2050 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot  and 55-68% in 
likely  below  2°C  scenarios  (Figure  6.29).  The  share  of  low-carbon  technologies  in  global  primary 
energy supply today is below 20% (Section 6.3, Chapter 3,Figure 6.29). The percentage of low- and 
zero-carbon  energy  will  depend  in  part  on  the  evolution  of  energy  demand  –  the  more  that  energy 
demand grows, the more energy from low- and zero-carbon sources will be needed and the higher the 
percentage of total primary energy these sources will represent. 

Low-  and  zero-carbon  sources  produce  97-99%  of  global  electricity  in  2050  in  scenarios  limiting 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and 93-97% in likely below 2°C scenarios (Figure 6.29) 
(medium confidence). Decarbonizing electricity generation, in tandem with increasing use of electricity 
(see below), is an essential near-term strategy for limiting warming. The increase in low- and zero-
carbon electricity will occur while electricity demand grows substantially. Studies have projected that 
global electricity demand will roughly double by 2050 and quadruple to quintuple by 2100 irrespective 
of efforts to reduce emissions (Bauer et al. 2017; Luderer et al. 2017; IEA 2019a). 

Renewable energy, especially generation from solar and wind, is likely to have an important role in 
many low-carbon electricity systems. The contributions of wind and solar electricity will depend on 
their levelized costs relative to other options, integration costs, system value, and the ability to integrate 
variable resources into the grid (Section 6.6). Electric sector technology mixes will vary by region but 
will typically include additional resources such as hydropower, nuclear power, fossil generation with 
CCS,  energy  storage  resources,  and  geothermal  energy,  among  others.  Contributions  of  different 
options vary widely across scenarios based on different assumptions about these factors (Figure 6.30).  

Nonetheless, it is likely that wind and solar will dominate low-carbon generation and capacity growth 
over the next couple decades due to supporting policies in many countries and due to their significant 
roles  in  early  electric  sector  decarbonization,  alongside  reductions  in  coal  generation  (Bistline  and 
Blanford 2021b; Pan et al. 2021). Clean firm technologies play important roles in providing flexibility 
and on-demand generation for longer durations, though deployment of these technologies is typically 
associated with deeper decarbonization levels (e.g., beyond 70-80% reductions), which are likely to be 
more important after 2030 in many regions, and with more limited CDR deployment (Baik et al. 2021; 
Williams et al. 2021a; Bistline and Blanford 2021a).

Box  6.11 Illustrative Low-Carbon Energy System Transitions 

There are multiple possible strategies to transform the energy system to reach net zero CO2 emissions 
and to limit likely warming to 2°C or below. All pathways rely on the strategies for net zero CO2 energy 
systems highlighted in Section 6.6.2, but they vary in the emphasis that they put on different aspects of 
these strategies and the pace at which they approach net zero emissions. The pathway that any country 
or region might follow will depend on a wide variety of factors (Section 6.6.4), including, for example, 
resource  endowments,  trade  and  integration  with  other  countries  and  regions,  carbon  sequestration 
potential, public acceptability of various technologies, climate, the nature of domestic industries, the 
degree of urbanization, and the relationship with other societal priorities such as energy access, energy 
security, air pollution, and economic competitiveness. The illustrative mitigation pathways presented 
in this box demonstrate four distinct strategies for energy system transformations and how each plays 
out for a different region, aligned with global strategies that would contribute to limiting warming to 
1.5°C.  Each  pathway  represents  a  very  different  vision  of  a  net  zero  energy  system.  Yet,  all  these 
pathways share the common characteristic of a dramatic system-wide transformation over the coming

Switching to Low-Carbon Energy Carriers. Switching to energy carriers produced from low-carbon 
sources will be an important strategy for energy sector decarbonization. Accelerated electrification of 
end  uses  such  as  light  duty  transport,  space  heating,  and  cooking  is  a  critical  near-term  mitigation 
strategy (Waisman et al. 2019; Sugiyama 2012; Zou et al. 2015; Rockström et al. 2017; IEA 2019f; 
Tang et al. 2021a). Electricity supplies 48-58% (interquartile range) of the global final energy demand 
by  2050 in scenarios  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no or  limited  overshoot  and  36-47% in  likely 
below 2°C scenarios (Figure 6.29). Globally, the current level of electrification is about 20%.  

Indirect  electrification  encompasses  the  use  of  electricity  to  produce  hydrogen  and  synthetic  fuels 
(efuels or power fuels). The extent of indirect electrification of final energy will depend on resource 
endowments  and  other  regionally  specific  circumstances.  Although  indirect  electrification  is  less 
efficient compared to direct electrification, it allows low-carbon fuels to be imported from regions with 
abundant low carbon electricity generation resources (Fasihi and Breyer 2020; Fasihi and Bogdanov 
2016; Lehtveer et al. 2019, Box 6.10 on regional integration). 

While  electrifying  end  uses  is  a  key  decarbonization  strategy,  some  end  uses  such  as  long-distance 
transport (freight, aviation, and shipping) and energy-intensive industries will be harder to electrify. For 
these  sectors,  alternative  fuels  or  energy  carriers  such  as  biofuels,  hydrogen,  ammonia  or  synthetic 
methane, may be needed (see Section 6.6 and Box 6.9). Most scenarios find that hydrogen consumption 
will grow gradually, becoming more valuable when the energy system has become predominantly low-
carbon (Figure 6.31).

Reducing Energy Demand. Energy service demand is expected to continue to increase with growth of 
the economy, but there is great uncertainty about how much it will increase (Riahi et al. 2017; Bauer et 
al. 2017; Yu et al. 2018). Given the need to produce low-carbon energy, the scale of energy demand is 
a critical determinant of the mitigation challenge (Riahi et al. 2012). Higher energy demand calls for 
more low-carbon energy and increases the challenge; lower energy demand reduces the need for low-
carbon sources and therefore can ease a low-carbon transtion. Recent studies have shown that tempering 
the growth of energy demand, while ensuring services and needs are still satisfied, can materially affect 
the need for technological CDR (see below) (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). Two of the 
Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMP-SP, IMP-LD) feature substantially lower final energy demand 
across  buildings,  transport,  and  industry  than  most  other  pathways  in  the  literature.  In  some  cases, 
energy demand levels are lower in 2050 (and later) than in 2019. These lower demands result in less 
reliance on bioenergy and a more limited role for CDR. [Ch. 3, Figure 3.18]  

6.7.1.3  Technology options to offset residual emissions 

CDR  technologies  can  offset  emissions  from  sectors  that  are  difficult  to  decarbonize  (Section  6.6), 
altering the timeline and character of energy sector transitions. A number of studies suggest that CDR 
is no longer a choice but rather a necessity to limit warming to 1.5°C (Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 
2015a; van Vuuren et al. 2018; Detz et al. 2018; Strefler et al. 2018). The reliance on CDR varies across 
scenarios and is tightly linked future energy demand and the rate of emission reductions in the next two 
decades:  deeper  near-term  emissions  reductions  will  reduce  the  need  to  rely  on  CDR  to  constrain 
cumulative  CO2  emissions.  Some  studies  have  argued  that  only  with  a  transition  to  lower  energy 
demands will it be possible to largely eliminate the need for engineered CDR options (Grubler et al. 
2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). Overall, the amount of CDR will depend on CO2 capture costs, lifestyle 
changes, reduction in non-CO2 GHGs, and utilization of zero-emission end-use fuels (van Vuuren et al. 
2018)(Muratori et al, 2017; van Vuuren et al, 2018).  

There is substantial uncertainty about the amount of CDR that might ultimately be deployed. In most 
scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C, CDR deployment is fairly limited through 2030 at less than 1 
Gt-CO2 yr-1. The key projected increase in CDR deployment (BECCS and DAC only) occurs between

2030 and 2050 with annual CDR in 2050 projected at 2.5-7.5 Gt-CO2 yr-1 in 2050 (interquartile range) 
in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5C with limited or no overshoot and 0.7-1.4 Gt-CO2 yr-1 in 2050 in 
scenarios limiting warming to 2C with limited or no overshoot. This characteristic of scenarios largely 
reflects substantial capacity addition of BECCS power plants. BECCS is also deployed in multiple ways 
across sectors. For instance, the contribution (interquartile range) of BECCS to electricity is 1-5% in 
2050 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5C with limited or no overshoot and 0-5% in scenarios limiting 
likely warming to below 2C . The contribution (interquartile range) of BECCS to liquid fuels is 9-21% 
in 2050 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5C with limited or no overshoot and 2-11% in scenarios 
limiting likely warming to below 2C. Large-scale deployment of CDR allows flexibility in timing of 
emissions reduction in hard-to-decarbonize sectors.  

CDR will influence the potential fossil-related stranded assets (Box 6.13). Availability of low-cost CDR 
can help reduce premature retirement for some fossil fuel infrastructure. CDR can allow countries to 
reach  net  zero  emissions  without  phasing  out  all  fossil  fuels.  Specific  infrastructure  could  also  be 
extended if it is used to burn biomass or other non-emitting sources. For example, existing coal-fired 
power plants, particularly those with CCS, could be co-fired with biomass (Pradhan et al, 2021; Woolf 
et al, 2016; Lu et al, 2019). In many scenarios, energy sector CDR is deployed to such an extent that 
energy sector CO2 emissions become negative in the second half of the century (Chapter 3).

Box  6.12 Taking Stock of the Energy System Transition 

The Global Stocktake is a regularly occurring process under the UNFCCC in which efforts will be made 
to  understand  progress  on,  among  other  things,  global  mitigation.  Collective  progress  of  countries 
towards the Paris Agreement goal will be assessed and its outcome will inform Parties in updating and 
enhancing their NDCs. This box explores potential indicators to understand energy system mitigation 
progress. 

CO2  emissions  from  fuel  combustion  are  the  bottom  line  on  energy  system  progress.  Beyond  CO2 
emissions, primary energy demand by energy sources, final energy consumption by sectors, and total 
electricity demand provide a first order assessment of energy system transitions. The year at which CO2 
emissions  peak  is  also  important.  The  Kaya  Identity can  be  used to  decompose  energy  system  CO2 
emissions into carbon intensity of the energy system (CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and 
industry  divided  by  energy  use),  energy  intensity  (energy  use  divided  by  economic  output),  and 
economic  output.  The  impacts  of  energy  and  climate  policy  are  reflected  in  the  changes  of  carbon 
intensity and energy intensity. Carbon intensity captures decarbonization of energy supply systems, for 
example through fuel switching from fossil fuels to non-fossil fuels, upscaling of low carbon energy 
sources,  and  deploying  carbon  dioxide  removal  technologies.  The  carbon  intensity  of  electricity  is 
specifically important, given the role of the electricity sector in near-term mitigation. Economy wide 
energy  intensity  represents  efforts  of  demand-side  energy,  such  as  energy  conservation,  increase  of 
energy performance of technologies, structural change of economy, and development of efficient urban 
infrastructure.  

Beyond these aggregate indicators, a second order assessment would capture more details, such as the 
electrification rate, share of renewables, nuclear, CCS or other low carbon technologies in electricity 
generation, land area used for energy production, and numbers of EV or PHEV. Consumption of coal, 
oil and gas captures the underlying factors of CO2 emissions. The emphasis of these indicators could 
differ across countries in the context of national specific circumstances. Technology- or project-based 
statistics are also useful to check the progress of the low-carbon transition, for example, the number of 
CCS facilities.

A critical challenge in the assessment of energy sector progress is how to measure societal, institutional, 
and political progress. These factors are difficult to quantify, yet they are fundamental determinants of 
the ability to reduce emissions. Public opinion, special interest politics, implications of mitigation for 
employment, energy subsidies, and energy policies are all critical indicators of progress. In addition, 
while much of the literature focuses on national level action, mitigation is increasingly being led by 
cities, states, provinces, businesses, and other subnational or non-national actors. Understanding the 
progress of these actors will be critical to assess energy system mitigation progress. New research is 
needed to better assess these “societal” indicators and the role of non-national actors.

6.7.2.  Investments in Technology and Infrastructure 

Total global energy investment was roughly USD 1940 billion yr-1 in 2019 (IEA 2021f). This total can 
be broken down into the following main categories: fossil-related energy supply, including oil, gas, and 
coal extraction and fossil electricity generation (USD 990 billion yr-1); renewable electricity, primarily 
solar and wind (USD 340 billion yr-1); nuclear energy (USD 40 billion yr-1); electricity networks (USD 
270 billion yr-1); and end-use energy efficiency (USD 270 billion yr-1).  

Energy investment needs are projected to rise going forward, according to investment-focused scenario 
studies found in the literature (Bertram et al. 2021; McCollum et al. 2018a; Zhou et al. 2019). While 
these increases are projected to occur in emissions-intensive pathways as well as low-carbon pathways, 
they are projected to be largest in low-carbon pathways. Average annual global energy investments over 
the 2016-2050 period range (across six models) from USD 2100 to 4100 billion yr-1 in pathways likely 
limiting warming to 2°C and from USD 2400 to 4700 billion yr-1 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C 
with no or limited overshoot (McCollum et al., 2018). Whatever the scenario, a significant and growing 
share  of  investments  between  now  and  2050  will  be  channelled  toward  infrastructure  build-out  in 
emerging economies, particularly in Asia (Zhou et al. 2019). 

More  widespread  electrification  of  buildings,  transport,  and  industry  means  particularly  substantial 
investment in the electricity system. According to C1-C3 pathways in the AR6 scenario database, such 
investments could be at the following average annual levels (inter-quartile range, USD2015) over the 
2023-2052 timeframe: USD 1670 to 3070 billion yr-1 (C1), 1600 to 2780 billion yr-1 (C2), and 1330-
2680 billion yr-1 (C3). (See also 3.6.1.3) 

Beyond  these  sector-wide  numbers,  a  key  feature  of  stringent  mitigation  pathways  is  a  pronounced 
reallocation  of  investment  flows  across  sub-sectors,  namely  from  unabated  fossil  fuels  (extraction, 
conversion,  and  electricity  generation)  and  toward  renewables,  nuclear  power,  CCS,  electricity 
networks and storage, and end-use energy efficiency (McCollum et al. 2018a; Bertram et al. 2021; IEA 
2021f) (Figure 6.32). Investments in solar, wind, and electricity transmission, distribution, and storage 
increase the most in mitigation scenarios. Up to 2050, the bulk of these investments are made in OECD 
and  Asian  countries  (Figure  6.33).  While  fossil  fuel  extraction  investments  exhibit  a  marked 
downscaling across all regions, compared to reference scenarios, the declines are especially strong in 
the Middle East, REF, and OECD.

‘T&amp;D’: transmission and distribution of electricity. ‘Extr.’: extraction of fossil fuels. Bars show median 
values across models-scenarios, and whiskers the inter-quartile ranges. See Chapters 3 and 15 for 
additional information on investments and finance. 

Investments into end-use energy efficiency are projected to also be substantial in mitigation pathways, 
potentially upwards of several hundred USD  billion yr-1 on average to 2050, compared to USD 270 
billion yr-1 in 2019 (McCollum et al. 2018a; IEA 2021f). However, the literature is inconsistent in how 
demand-side investments are calculated, as boundary conditions are less clear than for energy supply 
investments. Taking a broader definition can result in estimates that are an order-of-magnitude higher, 
meaning as large or larger than supply-side investments (IEA 2021f; Grubler et al. 2012). 

Increasing  low-carbon  investment  primarily  requires  shifting  existing  capital  investment  through 
regulation  and  incentives  as  well  as  removing  existing  investment  barriers  (McCollum  et  al. 
2018a)(Ameli, N. et al., 2021: Hafner et al. 2020: McCollum et al. 2018). While there is a considerable 
amount of capital in the world, it is not always available to those wishing to invest in certain projects. 
Total  annual  global  investment  in  fixed  capital  was  USD  22.4  trillion  in  2021,  over  an  order-of-
magnitude larger than energy sector investment (World Bank, 2021).  

Future  investment  patterns  will  vary  by  region,  as  they  do  now,  due  to  differences  in  risk  profiles, 
resource endowments and economic and governance structures (Zhou et al. 2019)(6.6; Ameli, N. et al., 
2021; Fizaine et al. 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). In rapidly growing countries, investments to support a 
low-carbon energy system transition will be integrated with those needed to meet rapidly increasing 
energy demands, irrespective of whether efforts are made to reduce emissions. In less-rapidly-growing 
countries  (Sun  et  al.  2019),  investments  will  focus  on  transitioning  current  energy  systems  to  low-
carbon configurations. Most current energy investments are concentrated in high- and upper-middle 
income countries (IEA 2021f), but this will change as investment needs continue to grow in today’s 
lower-middle and low-income countries (Bertram et al. 2021; McCollum et al. 2018a; Zhou et al. 2019; 
IEA 2021f). 

6.7.3  Energy System Lock-In and Path Dependence 

Path  dependence  refers  to  resistance  to  change  due  to  favourable  socio-economic  conditions  with 
existing  systems;  decisions  made  in  the  past  unduly  shape  future  trajectories.  Carbon  lock-in  is  a 
specific type of path dependence (Seto et al. 2016). Given that energy system mitigation will require a 
major course change from recent history, lock-in is an important issue for emission reductions in the 
energy sector. While lock-in is typically expressed in terms of physical infrastructure that would need 
to be retired early to reach mitigation goals, it involves a much broader set of issues that go beyond 
physical systems and into societal and institutional systems (Table 6.11).

6.7.3.1  Societal and Institutional Inertia 

A  combination  of  factors  -  user,  business,  cultural,  regulatory,  and  transnational  -  will  hinder  low-
carbon energy transitions. Strong path dependencies, even in early formative stages, can have lasting 
impacts on energy systems, producing inertia that cuts across technological, economic, institutional and 
political dimensions  (high confidence) (Vadén et al. 2019; Rickards et al. 2014) Chapter 5). 

Energy systems exemplify the ways in which massive volumes of labor, capital, and effort become sunk 
into particular institutional configurations (Bridge et al. 2013, 2018). Several embedded factors affect 
large-scale transformation of these systems and make technological diffusion a complex process: 

●  User environments affect purchase activities and can involve the integration of new technologies 
into  user  practices  and  the  development  of  new  preferences,  routines,  habits  and  even  values 
(Kanger et al. 2019).  

●  Business  environments  can  shape  the  development  of  industries,  business  models,  supply  and 
distribution chains, instrument constituencies and repair facilities (Béland and Howlett 2016). 
●  Culture can encompass the articulation of positive discourses, narratives, and visions that enhance 
cultural legitimacy and societal acceptance of new technologies. Regulatory embedding can capture 
the variety of policies that shape production, markets and use of new technologies. 

●  Transnational community can reflect a shared understanding in a community of global experts 

related to new technologies that transcends the borders of a single place, often a country. 

While  low-carbon  innovation  involves  systemic  change  (Geels  et  al.  2018),  these  are  typically  less 
popular  than  energy  supply  innovations  among  policymakers  and  the  wider  public.  Managing  low 
carbon transitions is therefore not only a techno-managerial challenge (based on targets, policies, and 
expert knowledge), but also a broader political project that involves the building of support coalitions 
that include businesses and civil society (moderate evidence, high agreement).  

Low-carbon transitions involve cultural changes extending beyond purely technical developments to 
include  changes  in  consumer  practices,  business  models,  and  organizational  arrangements.  The 
development  and  adoption  of  low-carbon  innovations  will  therefore  require  sustained  and  effective 
policies  to  create  appropriate  incentives  and  support.  The  implementation  of  such  policies  entails

political  struggles  because  actors  have  different  understandings  and  interests,  giving  rise  to 
disagreements and conflicts. 

Such innovation also involves pervasive uncertainty around technical potential, cost, consumer demand, 
and social acceptance. Such uncertainty carries governance challenges. Policy approaches facing deep 
uncertainty must protect against and/or prepare for unforeseeable developments, whether it is through 
resistance (planning for the worst possible case or future situation), resilience (making sure you can 
recover quickly), or adaptation (changes to policy under changing conditions). Such uncertainty can be 
hedged in  part  by  learning  by  firms,  consumers,  and policymakers.  Social interactions  and  network 
building  (e.g.,  supply  and  distribution  chains,  intermediary  actors)  and  the  articulation  of  positive 
visions,  such  as  in  long-term,  low-emission  development  strategies,  all  play  a  crucial  role.  This 
uncertainty extends to the impacts of low carbon innovations on energy demand and other variables, 
where unanticipated and unintended outcomes are the norm. For instance, rapid investments in public 
transport networks could restrict car ownership from becoming common in developing countries (Du 
and Lin 2017). 

6.7.3.2  Physical Energy System Lock-In 

Current  investments  in  fossil  infrastructure  have  committed  500-700  Gt-CO2  of  emissions,  creating 
significant  risks  for  limiting  warming  to  1.5℃  (Callaghan  2020)  (high  confidence).  These  current 
investments combined with emissions from proposed fossil infrastructure exceed the emissions required 
to  limit  warming  to  1.5℃  (medium  confidence).  Existing  coal  and  gas  fired  electricity  generation 
accounts for 200-300 Gt-CO2 of committed emissions. Emissions from coal generation are larger than 
for gas plants (Tong et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019). The lifetime of coal-fired power plants is 25-50 
years, creating long lasting risks to climate goals (Erickson and Tempest 2015). Gas-fired power plants 
are generally younger than coal-fired power plants. Industry sector lock-in amounts for more than 100 
Gt-CO2, while buildings and transport sector together contribute another 50-100 Gt-CO2 (Erickson and 
Tempest 2015). 

Lock-in is also relevant to fossil resources. Both coal and gas exploration continue, and new permits 
are being issued, which may cause economic (Erickson et al. 2018) as well as non-economic issues 
(Boettcher et al. 2019). 

The  nature  of  lock  in  varies  across  the  energy  system.  For  example,  lock-in  in  urban  and  transport 
sectors  is  different  from  the  electricity  sector.  Broadly,  urban  environments  involve  infrastructural, 
institutional, and behavioural lock-in (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). Addressing lock-in in these sectors 
requires action by multiple stakeholders and is unlikely with just technological evolution (Table 6.11).  

Committed carbon emissions are unevenly distributed. The disproportionate high share of committed 
emissions  in  emerging  economies  is  the  result  of  rapid  growth  in  recent  years,  which  has  led  to  a 
comparably  young  fossil  infrastructure  with  substantial remaining life  (Shearer et al.  2017). Mature 
industrialized countries tend to have older infrastructures, part of which will be up for retirement in the 
near  future  (Tong  et  al.  2019).  Coal-fired  power  plants  currently  planned  or  under  construction  are 
associated  with  150-300  Gt-CO2,  of  which  ~75%  and  ~10%  are  located  in  Asia  and  the  OECD 
respectively (Pfeiffer et al. 2018; Edenhofer et al. 2018). If implemented, these new fleets will further 
shorten all coal plants’ lifetimes by another 10 years for meeting climate goals (Cui et al. 2019)

Figure 6.34 Annual emissions from existing, proposed, and future energy system infrastructure (Tong 
et al. 2019). 

Despite the  imperative  to  reduce  use  of  fossil fuels and  the multiple  health  and  other  benefits from 
closing  coal-based infrastructure  (Liu et  al.  2019a;  Portugal-Pereira  et  al.  2018;  Rauner et  al.  2020; 
Karlsson et al. 2020; Cui et al. 2021), coal power plants have continued to be commissioned globally 
(Jewell et al. 2019; Jakob et al. 2020), most notably in Asian countries. Gas power plants also continue 
to be built. In many regions, new fossil electricity generation exceeds needed capacity (Shearer et al. 
2017). 

Existing  policies  and  the  NDCs  are  insufficient  to  prevent  an  increase  in  fossil  infrastructure  and 
associated  carbon  lock  in  (high  confidence)  (Bertram  et  al.  2015;  Johnson  et  al.  2015).  Current 
investment decisions are critical because there is limited room within the carbon budget  required to 
limit warming to well below 2°C (Rosenbloom 2019; Kalkuhl et al. 2019). Delays in mitigation will 
increase  carbon  lock-in  and  could  result  in  large-scale  stranded  assets  if  stringency  is  subsequently 
increased to limit warming (Box 6.11). Near-term implementation of stringent GHG mitigation policies 
are  likely to be most  effective in reducing  carbon lock-in  (Haelg  et al.  2018).  Near-term mitigation 
policies will also need to consider different energy transition strategies as a result of different resources 
and carbon budgets between countries (Bos and Gupta 2018; Lucas 2016). 

Near-term  policy  choices  are  particularly  consequential  for  fast-growing  economies.  For  example, 
Malik et al. (2020) found that 133 to 227 GW of coal capacity would be stranded after 2030 if India 
were  to  delay  ambitious  mitigation  through  2030  and  then  pursue  an  ambitious,  post-2030  climate 
strategy.  (Cui  et  al.  2021)identified  18%  of  old,  small,  inefficient  coal  plants  for  rapid  near-term 
retirement in China to help achieve air quality, health, water, and other societal goals and a feasible coal 
phaseout under climate goals. Comparable magnitudes of stranded assets may also be created in Latin 
America when adding all announced, authorized, and procured power plants up to 2060   (González-
Mahecha et al. 2019). Options to reduce carbon lock in include reducing fossil fuels subsidies (Box 
6.3),  building  CCS-ready  facilities,  or  ensuring  that  facilities  are  appropriately  designed  for  fuel 
switching (Budinis et al. 2018). Substantial lock-in may necessitate considerable deployment of CDR 
to compensate for high cumulative emissions. 

Past and present energy sector investments have created technological, institutional, and behavioural 
path dependencies aligned towards coal, oil, and natural gas (high confidence). In several emerging 
economies, large projects are planned that address poverty reduction and economic development. Coal 
infrastructure may be the default choice for these investments without policies to invest in low-carbon 
infrastructure instead (Steckel et al. 2020; Joshua and Alola 2020). Path dependencies frequently have

sustainability implications beyond carbon emissions. (Box 6.2 and Section 6.7.7). There are several 
SDG co-benefits associated with decarbonization of energy systems (Section 6.7.7; Sörgel et al. 2021). 
For example, coal mining communities frequently experience significant health and economic burdens 
from resource extraction.  

[START BOX 6.13 HERE] 

Box  6.13 Stranded Assets 

Limiting likely warming to 2°C or below will result in stranded assets (high confidence). Stranded assets 
can be broadly defined as assets which “suffer from unanticipated or premature write-offs, downward 
revaluations or [conversion] to liabilities.” Stranded assets may create risks for financial market stability 
and macro-economic stability (Mercure et al. 2018, Battiston et al. 2017; Sen and von Schickfus 2020), 
and  they  will  result  in  a  rapid  loss  of  wealth  for  the  owners  of  affected  assets  (Vogt-Schilb  and 
Hallegatte 2017; Ploeg and Rezai 2020). 

There  are  two  types  of  stranded  assets:  fossil-fuel  resources  that  cannot  be  burned,  and  premature 
retirement of fossil infrastructure (e.g., power plants). About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal 
reserves will remain unburnable if likely warming is limited to 2°C (Meinshausen et al. 2009; Leaton 
2011; Leaton Ranger 2013; Pye et al. 2020; IRENA 2017b; Bauer et al. 2016; McGlade and Ekins 2015) 
(high confidence). Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited 
to 1.5°C. Countries with large oil, gas, and coal reserves are most at risk (Caldecott et al. 2017; Ansari 
and Holz 2020)  

About 200 GW of fossil fuel electricity generation per year will likely need to be retired prematurely 
after  2030  to  limit  likely  warming  to  2°C,  even  if  countries  achieve  their  NDCs  (Iyer  et  al.  2015; 
Johnson et al. 2015; Fofrich et al. 2020) (medium confidence). Limiting warming to 1.5°C will require 
significantly more rapid premature retirement of electricity generation capacity (Binsted et al. 2020). 
Coal- and gas-fired power plants will likely need to retire about 25 years earlier than in the past to limit 
likely warming to 2°C, and 30 years earlier to limit warming to 1.5°C (Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 
2020). Coal-fired power plants are at significantly greater risk of stranding compared with gas-fired and 
oil-fired plants (Iyer et al. 2015; Johnson et al. 2015; Fofrich et al. 2020). The risks of stranded power 
plants are greatest in countries with newer fossil infrastructure.  

If  likely  warming  is  limited  to  2°C,  the  discounted  economic  impacts  of  stranded  assets,  including 
unburned fossil reserves, could be as high as USD 1-4 trillion from 2015 through 2050 (USD 10-20 
trillion in undiscounted terms) (Mercure et al. 2018), IRENA, 2017) (medium confidence). About 40% 
of these impacts correspond to unburned fossil reserves (IRENA 2017b). If warming is limited to 1.5°C, 
the economic impacts of stranded assets are expected to be significantly higher (Binsted et al. 2020)  

Stronger near-term mitigation will reduce premature retirements of fossil infrastructure, because more 
rapid mitigation will decrease new builds of fossil infrastructure that might later be stranded  (Johnson 
et al. 2015; Bertram et al. 2018) (high confidence). For example, if likely warming is limited to 2°C, 
strengthening  the  NDC  pledges  beyond  their  2015  levels  could  decrease  stranded  electricity  sector 
assets by more than 50% (Iyer et al. 2015). By contrast, if countries fail to meet their NDCs and continue 
to build fossil infrastructure, mitigation will need to be accelerated beyond 2030, resulting up to double 
the  amount of stranded electricity generation capacity  (Iyer et al. 2015). This corresponds to a total 
undiscounted cost of  about USD 2 trillion from electricity infrastructure alone, from the period 2015 
to 2050 (IRENA 2017). CCS (6.4) could potentially help reduce hundreds of gigawatts stranded power 
plant capacity along with other fossil-based capital (Clark and Herzog 2014; Fan et al. 2018; Iyer et al. 
2017).

6.7.4  Fossil fuels in a low-carbon transition 

Global fossil fuel use will need to decline substantially by 2050 to limit likely warming to 2°C or below, 
and it must decline substantially by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high 
confidence). Failing to reduce global fossil fuel use below today’s levels by 2030 will make it more 
challenging to limit likely warming to below 2°C. (high confidence). Fossil fuel use declines by 260-
330 EJ (52-73% from 2020 levels, interquartile range) through 2050 to limit warming to 1.5°C with no 
or  limited  overshoot  and  124-231  EJ  (23-51%  reduction  compared  to  2020  levels)  to  limit  likely 
warming to 2°C; this will require a significant reduction in coal, oil and gas investments. Fossil fuels 
account for about 80% of primary energy today. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with limited or 
no overshoot, fossil energy provides 59-69% (interquartile range) primary energy in 2030 and 25-40s% 
primary energy in 2050 (AR6 database). In scenarios limiting likely warming to 2°C or below, fossil 
energy provides 71-75% (interquartile range) primary energy in 2030 and 41-57% primary energy in 
2050 (AR6 database). The timeline for reducing production and usage varies across coal, oil, and gas 
due to their differing carbon intensities and their differing uses.   

Global coal consumption without CCS needs to be largely eliminated by 2040-2050 to limit warming 
to 1.5°C, and 2050-2060 to limit likely warming to 2°C (high confidence). New investments in coal-
fired  electricity  without  CCS  are  inconsistent  with  limiting  likely  warming  to  2°C  or  below  (high 
confidence)  (Spencer et al.  2018;  Pfeiffer  et al. 2018;  Edenhofer  et  al.  2018;  Cui  et  al.  2019).  Coal 
consumption  declines  130  EJ  yr-1  to  140  EJ  yr-1  in  2050  (79%  to  99%  compared  to  2020  levels, 
interquartile range) in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C and 118 EJ yr-1 to 139 EJ yr-1 (66% to 98% 
compared to 2020 levels) in scenarios limiting likely warming to 2°C. Coal consumption without CCS 
falls by 67% to 82% (interquartile range) in 2030 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot. Studies indicate that coal use may decline substantially in the US and Europe over 
the coming decade based on the increasing competitiveness of low-carbon sources and near-term policy 
actions (Oei et al. 2020; Grubert and Brandt 2019). In several developing economies, the relative youth 
of the coal-fired electricity fleet will make a complete phaseout before 2050 difficult (Garg and Shukla 
2009; Jewell et al. 2016). There are considerable differences in projected coal phaseout timelines in 
major Asian economies. Some studies suggest that coal may continue to be a part of the Chinese energy 
mix composing around a third of the total primary energy consumption by 2050 even if emissions are 
reduced by 50% by 2030 (He et al. 2020). Others indicate that a strategic transition would decrease the 
risk of stranded assets and enable a near-complete phaseout by 2050  (Wang et al. 2020a; Cui et  al. 
2021).  This  would  entail  prioritizing  earlier  retirements  of  plants  based  on  technical  (efficiency), 
economic (profitability, local employment) and environmental considerations (e.g., water scarcity for 
cooling).  

Natural gas may remain part of energy systems through mid-century, both for electricity generation and 
use in industry and buildings, and particularly in developed economies, even if likely warming is limited 
to 2°C or less (medium confidence). The decline in natural gas use in from 2020 to 2050 is 38 EJ yr-1 to 
78 EJ yr-1 (21% to 61% decline from 2020 levels, interquartile range) in scenarios limiting warming to 
1.5C with no or limited overshoot and -22 EJ yr-1 to 46 EJ yr-1 (-13% to 36% decline from 2020 levels) 
in scenarios limiting likely warming to 2°C. Scenarios indicate that gas use in electricity will likely 
peak around 2035 and 2050 if warming is limited to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot or likely below 
2°C, respectively. There is variability in the role gas would play in future scenarios based on national 
climate commitments and availability of cheap renewable (Vrontisi et al. 2020,  (Vishwanathan and 
Garg 2020; Malik et al. 2020). Note that these differences are not only present in the electricity sector 
but also in other end-uses. 

While oil use is anticipated to decline substantially, due to changes in the transport sector, its use will 
likely  continue  through  the  mid-century,  even  if  likely  warming  is  limited  to  2°C  or  less  (medium 
confidence). Oil use declines by 43 EJ yr-1 to 91 EJ yr-1 (19% to 54% from 2020 levels, interquartile

range) in scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and 46 EJ yr-1 to 109 EJ 
yr-1 (21% 60% from 2020 levels) by 2050 in scenarios that limit likely warming to 2°C. While oil use 
is anticipated to decline immediately in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C, it is likely to continue to 
be used through 2050. Oil use continues to be a significant source of transport fuels in most scenarios 
limiting likely warming to 2°C (Welsby et al, 2021). Oil use may reduce to about half of the current 
levels  as  a  transport  fuels  (Feijoo  et  al.  2020)  if  likely  warming  is  limited  to  2°C,  because  of  the 
availability of other options (biofuels, green hydrogen) and rapid deployment of EVs. In the absence of 
rapid transport electrification, the decline is slower with some studies projecting peak oil use around 
2035 (Delgado et al. 2020; Pan et al. 2020).   

There  is  a  lack  of  consensus  about  how  CCS  might  alter  fossil  fuel  transitions  for  limiting  likely 
warming  to  2°C  or  below.  CCS  deployment  will  increase  the  shares  of  fossil  fuels  associated  with 
limiting warming, and it can ease the economic transition to a low-carbon energy system (Muratori et 
al. 2016; Marcucci et al. 2019).While some studies find a significant role for fossil fuels with CCS by 
2050 (Koelbl et al. 2014; Eom et al. 2015; Vishwanathan and Garg 2020), others find that retirement of 
unabated coal far outpaces the deployment of coal with CCS (McJeon et al, 2021; Budinis et al. 2018; 
Xie et al. 2020) Moreover, several models also project that with availability of CO2 capture technology, 
BECCS might become significantly more appealing than fossil CCS even before 2050 (Luderer et al. 
2018b; Muratori et al, 2017).

6.7.5  Policy and Governance 

Policy  and  governance frameworks  are  essential  for shaping  near-  and  medium-term  low-emissions 
energy system transitions (high confidence). While policy interventions are necessary to achieve low-
carbon  energy  system  transitions,  appropriate  governance  frameworks  are  crucial  to  ensure  policy 
implementation  (high  confidence).  The  policy  environment  in  energy  transition  pathways  relate  to

climate policy goals, the characteristics of the policy regimes and measures to reach the policy goals 
including implementation limits and obstacles, and the timing of the climate instrument (Kriegler et al. 
2014b)  

The literature discusses a broad set of policy approaches. Environmental economics focuses mainly on 
market-based approaches as  the least-cost policy to achieve emission reductions  (Kube et al. 2018). 
Many countries, however, have implemented policy mixes with a diverse set of complementary policies 
to achieve energy and climate policy targets. One example is the German Energiewende, which includes 
substantial support for renewables, an action plan for energy efficiency, and phase-out processes for 
nuclear- and coal-based power generation next to carbon pricing (Löschel et al. 2019). The halving of 
CO2 emissions in UK power generation reflects multiple policies, particularly within the UK’s Climate 
Change Act 2008 (Grubb and Newbery 2018). More generally, the implementation of the NDCs under 
the Paris Agreement are all characterized by diverse climate policy mixes.  

These policy mixes (or policy packages) are shaped by different factors, including policy goals and 
objectives  (including  political,  social  and  technological  influences),  multiple  market,  governance  or 
behavioural  failures  or  previous  policy  choices  of  earlier  policy eras  (Rogge  2017). When  pursuing 
multiple  policy  goals  or  targeting  some  type  of  imperfection,  well  designed  policy  mixes  can  in 
principle reduce mitigation costs  (Corradini et al. 2018) or address distributional concerns, especially 
vulnerable populations. For example, the interaction between carbon pricing and the support for clean 
energy technologies in the EU clean low-carbon strategy for 2050 can reduce mitigation costs and allow 
for the early adoption of more stringent climate targets (Vandyck et al. 2016). Policy efforts to promote 
adoption of low-carbon technologies are more successful if they focus not only on economic incentives 
but include behavioural interventions that target relevant cognitive and motivational factors (Khanna et 
al. 2021; Mundaca et al. 2019; see also Section 6.7.6). Overlapping nudges might not necessarily lead 
to lower effectiveness (Brandon et al. 2019).  

Well-designed policy mixes can support the pursuit of multiple policy goals, target effectively different 
types of imperfections and framework conditions and take into account the technological, economical, 
and  societal  situation  (high  confidence).  Accounting  for  the  different  development  stages  of  new 
technologies  will  enhance  low-emissions  transitions  (Graaf  and  Sovacool  2020).  For  prototype 
technologies  and  technologies  in  the  demonstration  phase,  research  subsidies  and  demonstration 
projects are most important. For technologies experiencing early adoption, infrastructure development 
and strengthening of markets are increasingly important, while retiring or repurposing of existing assets 
is important for mature technologies (IEA 2020h) Effective policy mixes will address different market 
frictions and deal with various uncertainties, for example, those pertaining to technological, climate, 
and socio-economic developments  (Aldy 2020), but also with respect to outcomes of individual policies 
(e.g. Borenstein et al. 2019). Therefore, policy mixes may balance the trade-off between stability and 
the flexibility to change individual policies (Gawel and Lehmann 2019) and the policy mix over time 
(Rayner  et  al.  2017).  Some  policy  instruments  may  become  feasible  over  time,  for  example,  as 
technological advancements reduce the transaction costs of comprehensive market-based approaches 
(Andoni  et  al.  2019;  Di  Silvestre  et  al.  2020),  or  as weakened  barriers  to  stringency    enable  policy 
sequencing (Pahle et al. 2018) . Energy system policy mixes often include sector-specific regulation. 
Compared to economy-wide approaches, sectoral policies may be able to directly target specific sectors 
or mitigation options. However, uncoordinated implementation or limited coordination across sectors 
may lead to efficiency losses (e.g. Rosendahl et al. 2017). These losses also depend on other policies, 
such as pre-existing taxes (Goulder et al. 2016; Marten et al. 2018) or research and development policies 
(Acemoglu  et  al.  2016).  Moreover,  unilateral  policies  –  those  taken  by  individual  countries  in  the 
absence  of  coordination  with  other  countries  –  could  raise  carbon  leakage  risks,  while  balancing 
potential  issues  of  (industrial)  competitiveness  (Martin  et  al.  2014;  Rosendahl  et  al.  2017).  Energy 
leakage  may  become  more  important  during  low-carbon  energy  systems.  Numerous  studies  have

identified pathways for carbon leakage in electricity markets with incomplete emission markets (Caron 
et al. 2015; Thurber et al. 2015; Murray and Maniloff 2015; Fell and Maniloff 2017; Duan et al. 2017; 
Qian et al. 2018). Well-designed policy mixes will need to target the whole life-cycle or value chains, 
for example, through policies on limiting fossil fuel extraction (Asheim et al. 2019), or they will need 
to include measures to limit carbon leakage (e.g. Cosbey et al. 2019).  

Interactions between policy measures including their scope, stringency, and timing, influence the costs 
of reducing emissions (Corradini et al. 2018). In particular, some policy instruments may lead to lock-
in  effects  (Section  6.7.3.),  compete  with  other  regulations  (Graaf  and  Sovacool  2020),  or  trigger 
negative policy interactions (Perino 2015; Jarke-Neuert and Perino 2020). Existing policy mixes often 
reflect different political economy constraints and sometimes not well coordinated goals. The resulting 
policy mixes are often economically inefficient. However, comprehensive evaluation of policy mixes 
requires a broader set of criteria that reflect different considerations, such as broader goals (e.g., SDGs) 
and the feasibility of policies (high confidence).  

Policy mixes might rather emerge piece-by-piece over time out of individual policy interventions rather 
than be designed as a whole from the outset (Howlett 2014; Rogge 2017) and may reflect differences 
across  jurisdictions  and  sectors  (Howlett  2014).  For  example,  taking  into  account  country-specific 
objectives, failures, and limitations, carbon prices may be only one part of a broader policy mix and 
thereby may not be uniform across countries (Bataille 2020). This lack of consistency makes it more 
difficult to assess economic outcomes since costs of complementary policies are often less visible and 
are often targeted at high-cost mitigation options (Borenstein et al. 2019).  

Effective  assessment  of  policy  mixes  requires  comprehensive,  validated  international  data, 
methodologies,  and  indicators.  Existing  policy  mixes  are  difficult  to  evaluate  because  they  target 
multiple  objectives,  and  the  evaluation  must  consider  various  criteria  (Chapter  13,  6.7.7),  such  as 
environmental and economic effectiveness, distributional effects, transformative potential, institutional 
requirements, and feasibility. Economic outcomes depend on policy goals and implementation. Existing 
studies on policy mixes suggest the benefits of a comprehensive approach (Rosenow et al. 2017), while 
also  highlighting  that  an  “excessive”  number  of  instruments  may  reduce  overall  effectiveness 
(Costantini  et  al.  2017).  Combining  environmental  regulation  and  innovation  policies  may  be  of 
particular importance to tackle both emissions and innovation market failures (Fabrizi et al. 2018). The 
consistency and credibility of policy mixes is positively associated with green innovation  (Rogge and 
Schleich 2018).  

Potential future policies are difficult to evaluate due to methodological challenges (high confidence). 
Recent  model-based  analyses  of  future  policy  mixes  based  on  “current  policy  scenarios”  try  to 
implement existing policies besides explicit or implicit carbon prices (den Elzen et al. 2016; Roelfsema 
et al. 2020; van Soest et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2016). Many assessments of future low-carbon energy 
transitions are still based on cost-optimal evaluation frameworks and include only limited analysis of 
interactions between policy measures. Hence they are often not describing real-world energy transitions 
properly, but rather differences in implied carbon prices, constraints in technology deployment, and 
timing of policies (Trutnevyte 2016). 

6.7.6  Behaviour and Societal Integration 

Members of societies, including individuals, civil society, and businesses, will all need to engage with 
and be affected by low-carbon energy system transitions (high confidence). This raises questions about 
the extent to which different strategies and policy would effectively promote mitigation behaviours and 
the factors that increase the social acceptability of mitigation options, policies, and system changes.

6.7.6.1  Strategies to encourage climate mitigation actions 

Climate policy will be particularly effective if it targets key factor inhibiting, enabling, and motivating 
mitigation  behaviours.  As  barriers  differ  across  mitigation  options,  regions,  and  groups,  tailored 
approaches are more effective (Grubb et al. 2017). When people face important barriers to change (e.g., 
high costs, legal barriers), policy would be needed make low carbon actions more attractive, or to make 
high carbon actions less attractive. As people generally face multiple barriers for change, combinations 
of policies would be more effective (Rosenow et al. 2017).  

Financial  incentives  can  motivate  mitigation  actions  (Santos  2008;  Thøgersen  2009;  Eliasson  2014; 
Maki et al. 2016; Bolderdijk et al. 2011), particularly when actions are costly (Mundaca 2007). In many 
countries,  more  residential  solar  PV  were  installed  after  the  introduction  of  favourable  financial 
schemes such as feed-in-tariffs, federal income tax credits, and net metering (Wolske and Stern 2018). 
Similarly, a subsidy promoted the installation of solar water heaters in Asia (Chang et al. 2009). Yet, 
financial incentives may underperform expectations when other factors are overlooked. For example, 
people may not respond to financial incentives when they do not trust the organization sponsoring the 
program or when it takes too much effort to receive the incentive (Mundaca 2007; Stern et al. 2016a). 
Financial incentives are more effective if combined with strategies addressing non-financial barriers.  

Communicating  financial  consequences  of  behaviour  seems  less  effective  than  emphasizing  social 
rewards (Handgraaf et al. 2013) or benefits of actions for people (e.g., public health, comfort) and the 
environment (Asensio and Delmas 2015, 2016; Schwartz et al. 2015; Ossokina 2020; Bolderdijk et al. 
2013). Financial appeals may have limited effects because they reduce people’s focus on environmental 
consequences, weaken intrinsic motivation to engage in mitigation actions, provide a license to pollute 
(Agrawal et al. 2015; Bolderdijk and Steg 2015; Schwartz et al. 2015), and because pursuing small 
financial gains is perceived not worth the effort (Dogan et al. 2014; Bolderdijk et al. 2013). 

Providing information on the causes and consequences of climate change or on effective mitigation 
actions increases people’s knowledge and awareness, but generally does not promote mitigation actions 
by individuals (Abrahamse et al. 2005) or organizations (Anderson and Newell 2004). Fear-inducing 
representations of climate change may inhibit action when they make people feel helpless (O´Neill and 
Nicholson-Cole 2009). Energy-related advice and feedback can promote energy savings, load shifting 
in electricity use and sustainable travel, particularly when framed in terms of losses rather than gains 
(Gonzales et al. 1988; Wolak 2011; Bradley et al. 2016; Bager and Mundaca 2017). Also, credible and 
targeted information at the point of decision can promote action  (Stern et al. 2016a). Information is 
more effective when delivered by a trusted source, such as peers (Palm 2017), advocacy groups (Schelly 
2014), and community organizations (Noll et al. 2014), and when tailored to actors’ personal situation 
and core values (Abrahamse et al. 2007; Boomsma and Steg 2014; van den Broek et al. 2017; Daamen 
et al. 2001; Wolsko et al. 2016; Bolderdijk et al. 2013). This explains why home energy audits promoted 
energy savings (Delmas et al. 2013; Alberini and Towe 2015), and investments in resource efficiency 
and renewable energy generation (Kastner and Stern 2015).  

Energy use feedback can promote energy saving behaviour within households (Grønhøj and Thøgersen 
2011; Fischer 2008; Karlin et al. 2015; Delmas et al. 2013; Zangheri et al. 2019) and at work (Young 
et al. 2015), particularly when provided in real-time or immediately after the action so that people learn 
the  impact  of  different  actions  (Faruqui  et  al.  2009;  Delmas  et  al.  2013;  Abrahamse  et  al.  2005; 
Tiefenbeck et al. 2016; Stern et al. 2016a; Yu et al. 2015). Energy labels (Banerjee and Solomon 2003; 
Stadelmann  2017),  visualization  techniques  (Pahl  et  al.  2016),  and  ambient  persuasive  technology 
(Midden and Ham 2012) can encourage energy savings as they immediately make sense and hardly 
require  users’  conscious  attention.  Feedback  can  make  people  aware  of  their  previous  mitigation 
behaviours,  which  can  strengthen their  environmental  self-identity,  and  motivate  them  to  engage  in 
other mitigation actions as well as to act in line with their self-image (Van der Werff et al. 2014).

Social influence approaches that communicate what other people do or think can encourage mitigation 
actions (Clayton et al. 2015), as can social models of desired actions (Osbaldiston and Schott 2012; 
Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Wolske et al. 2020; Sussman and Gifford 2013). Feedback on one’s own 
energy use relative to others can be effective  (Nolan et al. 2008; Allcott 2011; Schultz et al. 2015), 
although not always, and effect sizes are small (Abrahamse and Steg 2013) compared to other types of 
feedback (Karlin et al. 2015).  

Interventions that  capitalize  on  people’s motivation to  be  consistent  can  promote  mitigation  actions 
(Steg 2016). Examples are commitment strategies where people pledge to act  (Abrahamse and Steg 
2013; Lokhorst et al. 2013), implementation intentions where they additionally explicate how and when 
they will perform the relevant action and how they would cope with possible barriers (Rees et al. 2018; 
Bamberg  2000,  2002),  and  hypocrisy-related  strategies  that  make  people  aware  of  inconsistencies 
between their attitudes and behaviour (Osbaldiston and Schott 2012).  

Bottom-up approaches can promote mitigation action (Abrahamse and Steg 2013). Indeed, community 
energy  initiatives  can  encourage  members’  low  carbon  behaviour  (Middlemiss  2011;  Seyfang  and 
Haxeltine 2012; Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Sloot et al. 2018). Organizations can promote mitigation 
behaviour  among  their  employees  and  customers  by  communicating  their  mission  and  strategies  to 
mitigate climate change (van der Werff et al. 2021; Ruepert et al. 2017).  

Default options, where a preset choice is implemented if users do not select another option, can promote 
mitigation actions such as energy savings, green electricity uptake, and meat-free meals options (Liebe 
et  al.  2021;  Pichert  and  Katsikopoulos  2008;  Ölander  and  Thøgersen  2014;  Kunreuther  and  Weber 
2014; Bessette et al. 2014; Ebeling and Lotz 2015; Liebe et al. 2018; Campbell-Arvai et al. 2014). 

6.7.6.2  Acceptability of policy, mitigation options and system changes 

Public acceptability reflects the extent to which the public evaluates climate policy, mitigation options, 
and system changes (un)favourably, which can  shape, enable, or prevent  low-carbon  energy system 
transitions. Public acceptability of policy and mitigation options is higher when people expect these 
have more positive and less negative consequences for self, others, and the environment (Demski et al. 
2015; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016; Perlaviciute and Steg 2014). Public opposition may result when 
a culturally valued landscape is affected by renewable energy development (Warren et al. 2005; Devine-
Wright and Howes 2010), particularly place-based identities are threatened (Devine-Wright 2009, 2013; 
Boudet  2019).  Acceptability  can  increase  after  a  policy  or  change  has  been  implemented  and  the 
consequences appear to be more positive than expected (Carattini et al. 2018; Schuitema et al. 2010; 
Eliasson 2014; Weber 2015); effective policy trials can thus build public support. 

Next, climate policy and low carbon options are evaluated as more fair and acceptable when costs and 
benefits are distributed equally, and when nature, the environment and future generations are protected 
(Schuitema et al. 2011; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016). Compensating affected groups for losses due 
to policy or systems changes enhanced public acceptability in some cases (Perlaviciute and Steg 2014), 
but people may disagree on which compensation would be worthwhile (Aitken 2010b; Cass et al. 2010), 
on the distribution of compensation (Devine-Wright and Sherry-Brennan 2019; Leer Jørgensen et al. 
2020), or feel they are being bribed (Perlaviciute and Steg 2014; Cass et al. 2010). Pricing policies are 
more acceptable when revenues are earmarked for environmental purposes (Steg et al. 2006; Sælen and 
Kallbekken 2011) or redistributed towards those affected (Schuitema and Steg 2008). 

Climate policy and mitigation options, such as renewable energy projects, are also perceived as more 
fair and acceptable when the public (Dietz 2013; Bidwell 2014; Bernauer et al. 2016b) or public society 
organizations  (Terwel  et  al.  2010;  Bernauer  et  al.  2016b)  could  participate  in  the  decision  making 
(Devine-Wright 2005; Terwel et al. 2012; Perlaviciute and Squintani 2020; Arvai 2003; Walker and 
Baxter 2017). People are more motivated to participate in decision making on local projects than on 
national or general policy goals (Perlaviciute and Squintani 2020). Public acceptability is also higher

when people can influence major rather than only minor decisions, particularly when trust in responsible 
parties is low (Liu et al. 2019a). Public participation can enhance the quality and legitimacy of decisions 
by including local knowledge and views that may otherwise be missed (Bidwell 2016; Dietz 2013).  

Public support is higher when people trust responsible parties (Perlaviciute and Steg 2014; Jiang et al. 
2018; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016; Michaels and Parag 2016; Liu et al. 2019a). Public support for 
unilateral  climate  policy  is  rather strong  and  robust  (Bernauer  et  al.  2016a), even  in the  absence  of 
reciprocal commitments by other states (Bernauer and Gampfer 2015).  

Public acceptability of climate policy and low carbon options differs across individuals. Climate policy 
and low carbon options are more acceptable when people strongly value protecting other people and 
the  environment,  and  support  egalitarian  worldviews,  left-wing  or  green  political  ideologies,  while 
acceptability is lower when people strongly endorse self-centered values, and support individualistic 
worldviews (Dietz et al. 2007; Perlaviciute and Steg 2014; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016). Similarly, 
public decision makers support climate policy more when they endorse environmental values (Nilsson 
et  al.  2016).  Climate  and  energy  policy  is  more  acceptable  when  people  are  more  concerned  about 
climate change (Hornsey et al. 2016), when they believe their actions would help mitigating climate 
change, and feel responsible to mitigate climate change (Steg 2005; Jakovcevic and Steg 2013; Ünal et 
al. 2019; Eriksson et al. 2006; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016; Kim and Shin 2017).   

6.7.7  The Costs and Benefits of Low-Carbon Energy System Transitions in the Context 

of Sustainable Development 

The attractiveness of energy sector mitigation ultimately depends on the way that it provides benefits 
and reduces the costs for the many different priorities that societies value(Wei et al. 2018, 2020; Yang 
et al. 2018a). While costs and benefits of climate mitigation are often considered in the context of pure 
economic outcomes – for example, GDP effects or changes in value of consumption – costs and benefits 
should be viewed with a broader lens that accounts for the many ways that the energy system interacts 
with societal priorities (Karlsson et al. 2020). Climate mitigation is not separate from countries’ broader 
growth and development strategies, but rather as a key element of those strategies.  

Cost reductions in key technologies, particularly in electricity and light-duty transport, have increased 
the economic attractiveness of near-term low-carbon energy system transitions (high confidence). The 
near-term, economic outcomes of low-carbon energy system transitions in some sectors and regions 
may be on par with or superior to those of an emissions-intensive future (high confidence). Even in 
cases  when  system  costs  are  higher  for  low-carbon  transitions,  these  transitions  may  still  be 
economically favourable when accounting for health impacts and other co-benefits (Gielen et al. 2019). 
Past  assessments  have  quantified  the  aggregate  economic  costs  for  climate  change  mitigation  using 
different  metrics,  for  example  carbon  prices,  GDP  losses,  investments  in  energy  infrastructure,  and 
energy system costs. Assessments of mitigation costs from integrated assessment and energy system 
models vary widely. For example, scenarios include carbon prices in 2030 of less than USD 20/t-CO2, 
but also more than USD 400/t-CO2 depending on the region, sector boundary, and methodology (e.g. 
(Bauer et al. 2016; Oshiro et al. 2017; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Brouwer et al. 2016). 
Those  arise  both  from  different  methodologies  (Guivarch  and  Rogelj  2017)  and  assumptions  about 
uncertainties in key factors that drive costs (Meyer et al. 2021)  

Recent  developments,  however,  raise  the  prospect  that  economic  outcomes  could  be  substantially 
superior to prior estimates, particularly if key technologies continue to improve rapidly. In some regions 
and circumstances, particularly in the electricity sector, near-term mitigation may well lead to superior 
economic  outcomes  than  continuing  to  invest  in  and  utilize  emissions-intensive  infrastructure  (e.g. 
(Brown et al. 2017; Kumar et al. 2020). Given the importance of electricity decarbonization in near-
term mitigation strategies (see Section 6.7.1), decreasing costs of solar PV, wind power, and batteries

to  support  their  integration,  have  an  outsized  influence  on  near-term  economic  outcomes  from 
mitigation. At the same time, economic outcomes may vary across regions depending, among other 
things, on the characteristics of the current energy systems, energy resources, and needs for integrating 
VRE technologies.  

The  long-term  economic  characteristics  of  low-emissions  energy  system  transitions  are  not  well 
understood and depend on policy design and implementation along with future costs and availability of 
technologies in key sectors (e.g., process heat, long-distance transport), and the ease of electrification 
in  end-use  sectors  (high  confidence).  The  long-term  aggregate  economic  outcomes  from  a  low-
emissions future are not likely to be substantially worse than in an emissions-intensive future and may 
prove  superior  (see,  e.g.,  Bogdanov  et  al.  2021,  Child  et  al.  2019,  Farmer  et  al.  2020)  (medium 
confidence). For the whole economy, the interquartile range of  estimated mitigation costs is between 
USD2015 140 and USD2015 340/t-CO2 in 2050 in scenarios limiting likely warming to 2°C and between 
USD2015  430  and  USD2015  990/tCO2  in  scenarios  limiting  likely  warming  to  1.5°C  (Chapter  3).  For 
energy sectors in various regions and globally, different scenarios show a wide range of implied carbon 
prices  in  2050 to limit  warming to 1.5°C,  from  below  USD  50/t-CO2  to  more than  USD  900/t-CO2 
(Brouwer et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Mitigation costs for scenarios limiting likely warming to 2°C 
were 3-11% in consumption losses in AR5, but the median in newer studies is about 3% in GDP losses 
(Su et al. 2018; Gambhir et al. 2019). 

Estimates of long run mitigation costs are highly uncertain and depend on various factors. Both faster 
technological developments and international cooperation are consistently found to improve economic 
outcomes (Paroussos et al. 2019). Long-term mitigation is likely to be more challenging than near-term 
mitigation  because  low-cost  opportunities  get  utilized  first  and  efforts  after  that  would  require 
mitigation  in  more  challenging sectors (Section  6.6). Advances in low-carbon  energy  resources  and 
carriers  such  as  next-generation  biofuels,  hydrogen  produced  from  electrolysis,  synthetic  fuels,  and 
carbon-neutral ammonia would substantially improve the economics of net zero energy systems (high 
confidence).  Current  estimates  of  cumulative  mitigation  costs  are  comparably  high  for  developing 
countries,  amounting  to  up  to  2-3%  of  GDP,  indicating  difficulties  for  mitigation  without  adequate 
support from developed countries (Fujimori et al. 2020; Dorband et al. 2019). In scenarios involving 
large amounts of stranded assets, the overall costs of low-carbon transitions also include the additional 
costs of early retirements (Box 6.11). 

Focusing only on aggregate economic outcomes neglects distributional impacts, impacts on broader 
SDGs, and other outcomes of broad societal importance. Strategies to increase energy efficiency and 
energy conservation are, in most instances, mutually reinforcing with strategies to support sustainable 
development. Improving efficiency and energy conservation will promote sustainable consumption and 
production of energy and associated materials (SDG-12) (high confidence). Contrastingly, successful 
implementation of demand-side options requires sustainable partnerships (SDG-17) between different 
actors in energy systems, for example governments, utilities, distributors, and consumers. Many authors 
have argued that energy efficiency has a large untapped potential in both supply and demand (Lovins 
2018; Méjean et al. 2019). For example, improved fossil power plant efficiency has been estimated to 
lower the costs of CCS from USD 80-100/t-CO2 for a subcritical plant to <usd for="" a="" high="" efficiency="" plant="" and="" zhai="" singh="" et="" al.="" this="" could="" enhance="" energy=""
