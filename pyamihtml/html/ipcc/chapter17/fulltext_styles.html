One key to enabling deep and broad transitions is integrating the views of different government agencies, businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in transition processes. Another critical driver of deep and broad transitions is engaging and empowering workers, youth,  women,  the  poor,  minorities  and  marginalized  stakeholders  in  just,  equitable  and  inclusive processes.

For  example,  the  First Assessment Report (FAR) highlighted the relevance of sustainable development for climate policy. The Second Assessment Report (SAR) went further to include equity issues in its presentation of sustainable development. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Banuri et al. 2001) made the link even stronger, noting that "parties have a right to and should promote sustainable development" (as stated in the text of the  UNFCCC  2015  (Article  3.4)),  and  offering  an early review  of  studies  integrating  sustainable development and climate change.

AR5  also concluded  that  the  link  between  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  is  cross-cutting  and complex, and that thus the impacts of climate change are threatening the efforts being made to achieve sustainable development.

In a growing number of studies, work on climate policies and just transitions towards sustainable  development  are  framed  as going  hand in  hand  (Fuso  Nerini  et  al.  2019;  Dugarova  and G&#252;lasan 2017; Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Schramade 2017; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019).  </span></div><div id="id1686"><span id="id1687" class="s1220">17.1.2  Integrating  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  International </span></div><div id="id1689"><span id="id1690" class="s1220">Policymaking Processes  </span></div><div id="id1692"><span id="id1693" class="s10">Among  the  reasons  for  the  growing  realization  of  these  interdependencies  are  milestones  in international climate and sustainable development processes. As outlined in Chapter 14, the year 2015 was  a  turning  point  due  to  two  agreements:  1)  the  Paris  Agreement;  and  2)  the  2030  Agenda  on Sustainable Development and its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Farzaneh et al. 2021).  </span></div><div id="id1699"><span id="id1700" class="s10">Following  a  long  history  of  references  to  sustainable  development  in  the  UNFCCC  and  related agreements,  the  Paris  Agreement  helped  to  strengthen  the  links  between  climate  and  sustainable development by emphasizing  that sustainability is related to its objectives (Sindico 2016; UNFCCC 2016). One of the ways that it helped tighten this link is by institutionalizing bottom-up pledges and the review  architecture.  Toward  this  end,  the  Paris  Agreement  instituted  nationally  determined contributions  (NDCs)  as  vehicles  through  which  countries  make  pledges  and  demonstrate  their commitment to climate action. Although there was no clear guidance on what should be included in the NDCs, some of the requirements were elaborated in the Paris Rule Book (see above, Chapter 14). Some of the submitted NDCs included only mitigation efforts, but others set out mitigation and adaptation goals aligning NDC commitments to national planning processes, while yet others mentioned links with the SDGs. </span></div><div id="id1712"><span id="id1713" class="s10">Another  way  that  the  Paris  Agreement  and  the  NDCs  could  strengthen  their  links  to  sustainable development is to update country-specific climate pledges. Countries are free to choose their targets and the means and instruments with which to implement them. A core feature of the NDCs was that countries submit NDCs every five years, giving them an opportunity to assess themselves relative to other  countries,  raise  their  ambitions  and  learn  from  their  peers.  Moreover,  it  was  emphasized  that </span><span id="id1719" class="s10">countries should not &#8220;backslide&#8221; in subsequent NDCs, thus ensuring that countries should always be </span><span id="id1721" class="s10">forward-looking in respect of increasing their ambitions to deliver the Paris Goals. H&#246;hne et al. (2017) found  that,  in  developing  countries  especially,  the  NDC  preparation  process  has  improved  national climate policy-making.  </span></div><div id="id1725"><span id="id1726" class="s10">Despite some favourable reviews, several assessments of specific countries</span><span id="id1727" class="s10">&#8217;</span><span id="id1728" class="s10"> NDCs (Andries et al. 2017; Rogelj  et  al.  2016;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016)  have  assessed  that  those  submitted  for  2020-2030  are insufficient for delivering on the Paris goals. Updated and/or new NDCs were therefore submitted by end  of  2020.  However,  an  assessment  of  those  NDCs  revealed  that  the  level  of  ambition  was significantly lower than the goals of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCO 2020; see also this Chapter). One of the urgent calls in Paris was to assess the impacts and efforts that need to be undertaken to keep global  warming  well  below  2&#176;C  in  relation  to  pre-industrial  levels  and  evaluate  related  global greenhouse-gas  emission  pathways  (UNFCCC  2015).  Although  the  initial  NDCs  fell  short  of  these goals,  the  idea  was  that  NDCs  would  be  living  documents  that  could  ratchet  up  climate  action  and ambition. </span></div><div id="id1739"><span id="id1740" class="s10">Countries  have  also  started  to  take  actions  on  the  SDGs  themselves  (Antwi-Agyei  et  al.  2018a; UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018). The SDGs were perceived as a novel approach to development and as establishing  a  universal  agenda  for  the  transformation  of  development  patterns  and  socioeconomic systems. At their core, the SDGs hold that building an integrated framework for action necessitates </span></div><div id="id1757"></div><div id="id1878"><span id="id1879" class="s10">addressing  the  economic,  social  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable  development  in  an integrated manner (Biermann et al. 2017; Kanie and Biermann 2017). The SDGs take multiple elements of development into account in aiming to offer coherent, well-integrated, overarching approaches to a range of sustainability challenges, including climate change. </span></div><div id="id1884"><span id="id1885" class="s10">One way a link is made between climate and the SDGs is through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). Paralleling the bottom-up orientation of the Paris Agreement and the NDCs, every year approximately forty  countries  voluntarily  share  their  VNRs  with  the  international  community  at  the  High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). Even more flexible than the NDCs, the VNRs can include content such as a summary of key policies and measures that are intended to achieve the SDGs, a list of the means of implementation that support the SDGs, and related challenges and needs. The VNRs also often cover SDG 13 (on climate change) as well as many other issues connected with climate change. Even with these links, implementation of the SDGs should be mentioned as part of national development processes reflecting  </span><span id="id1894" class="s10">different  countries&#8217;  </span><span id="id1895" class="s10">different  priorities,  visions  and  plans  (Hanson  and  Puplampu  2018; Marcotullio et al. 2018; OECD 2016; Puplampu et al. 2017; Srikanth 2018). </span></div><div id="id1898"><span id="id1899" class="s10">Yet  another  way  that  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  underlines  the  importance  of capturing synergies is its calls for policy coherence (goals 17 and 14). Policy coherence and integration between  sectors  are  two  of  the  most  critical  factors  in  breaking  down  the  silo  mode  of  working  of different sectors. Working across climate and other sustainability agendas is essential to coherence.  </span></div><div id="id1904"><span id="id1905" class="s10">A final way that the sustainability and climate agendas have been linked is through vertical integration. Following a similar trend that appeared with Agenda 21, for which many cities adopted local plans, a growing number of cities have introduced Voluntary Local Reviews. The VLRs resemble the VNRs, but  place  the  emphasis  on  local  actions  and  needs  regarding  the  SDGs  (and  some  links  to  climate change)  (Ort&#237;z-Moya  et  al.  2021).  The  2019  SDG  Report  shows  that  150  countries  have  developed national  urban  plans,  almost  half  of  them  also  being  in  the  implementation  phase  (United  Nations General Assembly 2019). </span></div><div id="id1913"><span id="id1914" class="s1220">17.1.3 Integrating Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Other Policymaking </span></div><div id="id1916"><span id="id1917" class="s1220">Processes  </span></div><div id="id1919"><span id="id1920" class="s10">Other non-UN-led initiatives involving international organizations or clusters of countries have also helped to raise the issue of sustainable development as a framework for mitigation. The OECD, for instance,  assesses  different  types  of  investments  and  economic  activities  with  reference  to  their significance for environmental sustainability (OECD 2020), while G20 countries have drawn up action agendas  with  sustainable  development  at  the  (UToronto  2016).  Meanwhile,  the  Petersberg  Climate Dialogue, a political movement convened by major country-group representatives launched in 2010 by the  German  government,  has  also  called  for  sustainability  to  be  an  intrinsic  part  of  the  transition (UNFCCO 2020; BMU 2018).  </span></div><div id="id1929"><span id="id1930" class="s10">Due in part to the shifting orientation of these international processes, there  is growing evidence of action  on  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  at  other  levels  of  decision-making.  National policies  often  aim  to  implement  climate  change  policies  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development (Chimhowu et al. 2019;  Chirambo  2018;  ECLAC  2017;  Fuseini and  Kemp 2015;  Galli  et  al.  2018; Haywood  et  al.  2019;  Ministry  of  Environment  of  Jordan  2016;  McKenzie  and  Abdulkadri  2018; UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018; UN Women 2017). Some countries are adjusting their existing policies to build on themes familiar to sustainable development (Lucas et al. 2016), including renewable energy and energy efficiency (Fastenrath and Braun 2018; Kousksou et al. 2015), urban planning (Gorissen et al. 2018; Loorbach et al. 2016; Mendizabal et al. 2018), health systems (Pencheon 2018; Roschnik et </span><span id="id1940" class="s10">al. 2017) and agricultural systems (Lipper and Zilberman 2018; Shaw and Roberts 2017). Cross-cutting and  integrated  approaches,  such  as  the  circular  economy,  have  also  been  gaining  traction  in  some European countries (EESC 2015) and G20 countries (Noura et al. 2020). Many of these efforts have also extended up to the regional and down to the local level (Gorissen et al. 2018; Hess 2014; Shaw and Roberts 2017).  </span></div><div id="id1956"></div><div id="id2076"><span id="id2077" class="s10">There has also been a shift to actors outside government aligning climate with sustainable development. An  assessment  by  Hoyer  (2020)  found  that  collective  action  against  climate  change  by  businesses, governments  and  civil  society,  reinforced  through  partnerships  and  coalitions  across  departments, industries  and  supply  chains,  can  deliver  significant  development  impacts.  In  order  for  this  diverse collection of stakeholders to take action, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed from a linear model of knowledge-generation to an interdisciplinary model that co-produces knowledge (Liu et al. 2019). In fact,  some  have  argued  that  accelerating  just  transitions  for  purposes  of  sustainable  development requires the involvement of several actors, institutions and disciplines (Delina and Sovacool 2018). Not only do these roles need to be discussed more thoroughly (Kern and Rogge 2016; den Elzen et al. 2019), but it is also important to survey different views on transitions and transformations. A variety of theories that are useful for explaining the causes and constraints regarding transitions are examined in Section 17.2. </span></div><div id="id2090"><span id="id2091" class="s0">17.2</span><span id="id2093" class="s0">Accelerating Transitions in the Context of Sustainable Development: </span></div><div id="id2095"><span id="id2096" class="s0">Definitions and Theories </span></div><div id="id2098"><span id="id2099" class="s10">This section focuses on how different theoretical frameworks can help us understand and explain what is meant by accelerating transitions in the context of sustainable development.

This set of factors can lock in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering the momentum needed for transformations. Chapter 16 (above) provides an overview of the multistage  transition  dynamics  involved  in  moving  from  experimentation  to  commercialization  to integration to stabilization. That overview  describes  how transitions can break through lock-ins and result in a transformation.</span></div><div id="id2134"><span id="id2135" class="s10">While there may be a relatively consistent set of transition dynamics for all countries, pathways are likely to vary across and even within countries. This variation is due to different development levels, starting points, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and </span><span id="id2139" class="s10">other contextual factors. Given the diversity of contributing factors, a sustainable transition is likely to be a complex and multi-faceted process which cannot be reduced to a single dimension (K&#246;hler et al. 2019). Even with this multi-dimensionality, transition processes are likely to gain speed and become more sustainable as decision-makers adopt targeted policies and other interventions. Many disciplines have reflected on the roles  of and relative influence on the policies and interventions that can drive transitions. The following discussion describes this diversity of views with a survey of how prominent lines of economic, psychological, institutional and systems thinking explain transitions. Though these disciplines differ greatly, they often stress that leveraging synergies and managing trade-offs between climate change and sustainable development can help advance a transition. </span></div><div id="id2149"><span id="id2150" class="s1220">17.2.1 Economics </span></div><div id="id2152"><span id="id2153" class="s10">This  section  concentrates  on  economic  explanations  for  transitions.

<div id="id2236"><span id="id2237" class="s10">environmental  benefits.  Many  modern  economic  systems  may  nonetheless  struggle  to  deliver  these benefits due to major disruptions and shocks such as climate change  (Heal 2020). One way to limit disruptions to free markets are targeted interventions in free markets such as taxes or regulation. These targeted  interventions  motivate  firms  and  other  entities  to  internalize  GHGs  and  other  pollutants, potentially paving the way for a sustainable transition (Arrow et al. 2004; Chichilnisky and Heal 1998).  </span></div><div id="id2243"><span id="id2244" class="s10">A  related  line  of  thought  common  to  economic  explanations  involves  the  principles  of  </span><span id="id2245" class="s10">&#8220;weak sustainability&#8221;. These princi</span><span id="id2247" class="s10">ples suggest that the substitution of exhaustible resources is, to some extent, feasible  (Arrow  et  al.  2004).  One  way  to  capitalize  on  this  substitution  is  to  target  investments  at technological change, green growth, and research and development. Targeted investments in the form of subsidies can encourage the substitution of exhaustible by non-exhaustible resources. To illustrate with a concrete example, investments in renewable energy can not only mitigate climate change but also offset the use of exhaustible fossil fuels and boost energy security (Heal 2020). It is nonetheless important to note that the principles of </span><span id="id2254" class="s10">&#8220;weak sustainability&#8221; contrasts with &#8220;strong sustainability&#8221; or &#8220;integrated sustainability&#8221; principles. These stronger principles suggest </span><span id="id2256" class="s10">that constraints on resources restrict  such  substitutions  (Rockstr&#246;m  et  al.  2009).  These  constraints  merit  attention  because  some scarce non-substitutable forms of natural capital can be exhausted (Bateman and Mace 2020). There is hence a need to capitalize on possible synergies such as those with other development priorities and trade-offs, for example, the exhaustion of non-substitutable resources. Capturing these synergies and managing these trade-offs is consistent with sustainable development, a state where the needs of the </span><span id="id2263" class="s10">present  generation  do  not  compromise  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs </span><span id="id2265" class="s10">(Bruntland, WCED 1987).  </span></div><div id="id2267"><span id="id2268" class="s10">As  suggested  above,  aligning  climate  investments  with  other  sustainable  development  objectives  is critical  to  a  transition.  In  order  to  support  better  investments  in  sustainable  development,  financing schemes, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure schemes and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), can play important roles (Executive Summary in Chapter  15).  After  COVID-19,  economic  recovery  packages  have  increased  government-led investments  (Section  1.3.3  in  Chapter  1),  which  could  potentially  be  aligned  with  sustainable development. Technological change and innovation are considered key drivers of economic growth and of many aspects of social progress (Section 16.1 in Chapter 16), but if technological innovation policies are  coordinated  with  the  shift  to  sustainable  development  pathways,  then  the  economic  benefits  of technological  change  could  come  at  the cost of  increasing  climate risks  (Chapter  16,  Gossart  2015) Chapter 16, 16:1; Alarc&#243;n and Vos 2015). The environmental impacts of social and economic activities, including emissions of GHGs, are greatly influenced by the rate and direction of technological changes. Innovation and technological transformations present trade-offs that create externalities and rebound effects.  This  suggests  that  a  sustainable  future  for  people  and  nature  requires  rapid,  radical  and transformative societal change by integrating the technical, governance, financial and societal aspects  (Chapter 16, 16.1; P&#246;rtner et al. 2021).  </span></div><div id="id2285"><span id="id2286" class="s10">One area that is pertinent to transitions and has received considerable attention in economic modelling </span><span id="id2288" class="s10">involving  climate  change  is  innovation.  In  particular,  some  studies  have  shown  how  low-cost innovations  and  improvements  in  end-use  technologies  have  significant  potential  for  emissions reductions as well as sustainable development (Wilson et al. 2019). Currently information technologies are improving rapidly, and IoT, AI and Big Data can all contribute to other development needs. This is often the case in end-use sectors, as the benefits accrue directly to the individuals who use the new innovations. The achievement and widespread deployment of fully autonomous cars, for example, will bring  about  broader  car-  and  ride-sharing  with  negative  or  low  additional  costs  compared  to  more conventional approaches to car ownership, with their typically very low load factors. (Grubler et al. 2018)  estimate  that the  low  energy  demand  (LED)  scenario  which  assumes  information  technology innovations and induced social changes, including a sharing economy, have considerable potential for </span><span id="id2299" class="s10">harmonizing the multiple achievements of SDGs with low marginal abatement costs compared with other scenarios (IPCC 2018).  </span></div><div id="id2375"></div><div id="id2490"><span id="id2491" class="s10">It  is  nonetheless  important  to  highlight  a  caveat  to  the  above  logic  on  innovation.  Whether  a technological innovation is wholly sustainable or not becomes less clear when considering its effects on the wider economy. To illustrate, some models predict that CO</span><span id="id2494" class="s1031">2</span><span id="id2495" class="s10"> marginal abatement costs in the power sector will be 240 and 565 USD/tCO</span><span id="id2497" class="s1031">2</span><span id="id2498" class="s10"> for the 2 degree and below 2 degree goals respectively (IEA 2017). </span></div><div id="id2501"><span id="id2502" class="s10">In  theory,  if  marginal  abatement  costs  meet  marginal  climate  damage,  mitigation  measures  are economically  optimal  in  the  long  run.  Yet  marginal  damage  from  climate  change  is  notoriously uncertain,  and  economic  theories  do  not  always  reflect  climate-related  damage.  On  the  other  hand, marginal abatement mitigation costs impose additional costs in the short term. These added costs can cause productivity in capital to decline through increases in the prices of energy and products in which the energies are embodied. These increased costs can restrict the ability to invest in and achieve the sustainable development priorities. However, precisely the opposite can occur when innovation reduces additional costs or achieves negative costs. If technological innovation leads to the accumulation of capital and productivity increases due to the substitution of energy, material and labour, these are likely to deliver sustainable development and climate mitigation benefits. </span></div><div id="id2513"><span id="id2514" class="s1220">17.2.2 Institutions, Governance, and Political Economy  </span></div><div id="id2516"><span id="id2517" class="s10">This  subsection  focuses  on  institutions,  governance  and  the  political  economy.  Institutional  and governance arrangements can influence which actors possess authority, as well as how motivated they are to cooperate in transition processes that are directed at finding solutions to climate change and other sustainability challenges. Often cooperation is enabled when policy frameworks or institutions align climate change with the political and economic interests of national governments, cities or businesses, and when institutional and governance arguments that support that alignment expand the scale of the transitions. However, there may also be political and economic interests and structures that can lock in unsustainable  development  patterns,  frustrate this  alignment and  slow  down  transitions  (Haas  2021; Mattioli et al. 2020; Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Power 2016).  </span></div><div id="id2527"><span id="id2528" class="s10">An  extensive  literature  has  examined  how  the  international  climate  agreements  and  architecture influence collaboration  across countries regarding climate and sustainable development to support a transition (Bradley 2005). For example, international institutions offer opportunities for governments and other actors to share new perspectives on integrated solutions (Cole 2015). For some observers, however,  decades  of  difficulties  in  crafting  a  comprehensive  climate-change  agreement  and  the resulting  fragmented  climate-policy  landscape  have  been  inimical  to  the  collaboration  needed  for  a transition  (Chapter 1 and 13; Nasiritousi and B&#228;ckstrand 2019; van Asselt 2014). Yet others see the potential for more incremental cooperation across countries, even without a single, integrated forms of climate governance (Keohane and Victor 2016).  </span></div><div id="id2538"><span id="id2539" class="s10">A  related  argument  suggests  that  fragmentation  at  the  global  level  provides  opportunities  for cooperation at the national level (Kanie and Biermann 2017). For example, in contrast to the relatively </span><span id="id2542" class="s10">top-down Kyoto Protocol, the bottom-up pledge and review architecture of the Paris Agreement has prompted  national  governments  to  integrate  climate  change  with  other  sustainable  development priorities  (Nachmany  and  Setzer  2018;  Townshend  et  al.  2013).  Concrete  examples  included incorporating the SDGs into the NDCs as an international response to climate change (The Energy and Resources  Institute  2017)  or  bringing  climate  into  sustainable  development  strategies  and  so-called voluntary national reviews (VNRs) as part of the SDG and 2030 Agenda process (Elder and King 2018; Elder and Bartalini 2019).  </span></div><div id="id2550"><span id="id2551" class="s10">Another branch of institutional research is concerned with the interactions between multiple levels of governance. In this multi-level governance perspective, cities and other subnational governments often </span><span id="id2554" class="s10">lead transitions by devising innovative solutions to challenged to climate and local energy, transport, the environment, resilience and other forms of sustainability (Bellinson and Chu 2019; Doll and Puppim De Oliveira 2017; Geels 2011; Koehn 2008; Rabe 2007; van der Heijden et al. 2019). A complementary perspective suggests that national governments can help scale up transitions by allocating resources and </span></div><div id="id2575"></div><div id="id2695"><span id="id2696" class="s10">can provide the technical support that can spread innovative solutions (Bowman et al. 2017; Corfee-Morlot  et  al.  2009;  Gordon  2015).  Such  support  has  become  increasingly  important  during  the pandemic,  as  national  government  transfer  funds  for  investments  in  climate-friendly  infrastructure, transport systems and energy systems. This line of thinking is supported by calls to strengthen vertical and horizontal integration within and across government agencies and stakeholders in ways that can enhance policy coherence (Amanuma et al. 2018; OECD 2018, 2019). The incoherence or misalignment between national and local fiscal institutions and policies can restrict the ability of local governments to secure resources for climate-friendly investments. Such investments are particularly likely to flow, as more local governments have adopted net zero targets, climate emergency declarations and action plans  that  can  stimulate  innovations  (Davidson  et  al.  2020).  Others  have  seen  greater  potential  for collaboration and innovation, with more multi-centred or polycentric forms of governance that lead to the  formulation  and  dissemination  of  transformative  solutions  to  climate  and  other  environmental challenges  (Ostrom 2008).

Other  forms  of  multi-stakeholder partnerships focusing on issues with strong climate synergies, such as forms of air pollution known as short-lived climate pollutants (Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)) or transport (Sustainable Low Carbon Transport Partnership (SLoCaT)), take their cue from global scientific communities or civic-minded advocacy groups that transmit knowledge across boundaries (Keck and Sikkink 1999).  There is also scope for suggesting that the international climate regime serves a Global Framework for Climate Action (GFCA) in helping orchestrate the multilateral climate regime and non-state and subnational initiatives  (Chan  and  Pauw  2014),  though  questions  remain  about  its  actual  impacts  on  mitigation (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017).  </span></div><div id="id2738"><span id="id2739" class="s10">Policymaking institutions and networks are themselves policies. A significant literature has looked at integrated policy frameworks and efforts across sectors, including climate adaptation and mitigation, as drivers of transitions (Landauer et al. 2015; Favretto et al. 2018; Obersteiner et al. 2016; Steen and Weaver 2017; Thornton and Comberti 2017). Policy coherence between climate and other development objectives  is  often  considered  essential  to  sustainable  development  (Sovacool  2018).  A  similar </span><span id="id2745" class="s10">discussion  about  synergies  and  conflicts  has  been  raised  on  the  relationship  between  resilience  and sustainability  (Marchese  et  al.  2018).

Following these calls, some governments have aimed to address climate change and sustainability jointly with coherent and integrated approaches to achieving these agendas (Chimhowu et al. 2019), although for some countries (SIDS) this has proven more challenging  (Scobie 2016). </span></div><div id="id2757"><span id="id2758" class="s10">Though the above work tends to downplay politics and business, others suggest that political economy should feature prominently in transitions.

These vested interests can lock in status quo policies in countries where political systems offer interest groups more opportunities to veto or overturn climate- or eco-friendly proposals (Madden 2014). Companies with a strong interest in earning profits and building competitiveness from conventional fossil fuel-based energy systems have particularly strong incentives to capture politicians and agencies (Meckling and Nahm 2018). Such strategies can be particularly powerful when combined with concerns over job losses and dislocation, preventing transitions from gaining traction (Haas 2021; Mattioli et al. 2020; Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Power 2016).  </span></div><div id="id2893"><span id="id2894" class="s10">This suggests that politics can be an impediment to change: other studies argue instead that politics can be harnessed to drive transitions forward. For example, some observers contend that building coalitions around green industrial policies and sequencing reforms to reward industries in such coalitions can align otherwise divergent interests and inject momentum into transitions (Meckling et al. 2015). Others see the  effects  of  political  economy  varying  over  time  depending  upon  external  market  conditions.  To illustrate, renewable feed-in tariffs in Europe persisted for over two decades and were crucial in wind and solar power technologies making the breakthrough. But once competition from China led to the demise of European technology providers, and once European populations started to oppose surcharges on  their  electricity  bills,  feed-in  tariffs  were  abolished  by  politicians  in  the  purely  national  interest (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017).  </span></div><div id="id2905"><span id="id2906" class="s1">17</span><span id="id2907" class="s1220">.2.3   Psychology, Individual Beliefs and Social Change</span></div><div id="id2910"><span id="id2911" class="s10">This subsection draws on value- and action-oriented research that employs inter- or transdisciplinary methods  such  as  transactional  psychology,  transformative  science  and  similarly  focused  disciplines (Wamsler et al. 2021).

These shifts in values can occur when humans reconnect with nature, deepen their consciousness and take responsibility for protecting the planet and its climate (Cross et al. </span><span id="id2956" class="s10">2019; Martinez-Juarez et al. 2015; Speldewinde et al. 2015). Changes in both values and beliefs may also  emerge  through  consciousness-raising  processes  where  people  cooperate  in  ways  that  would protect the climate (see  Section 1.6.4 in Chapter 1; Banks 2007; Hedlund-de Witt et al. 2014; Woiwode and Woiwode 2019). </span></div><div id="id3056"></div><div id="id3179"><span id="id3180" class="s10">Many  of  the  above-mentioned  beliefs  and  values  that  support  climate  actions  have  spread  through expanding interests in conservationist world views, indigenous cultures (see e.g., Lockhart 2011) and branches of neuroscience and psychology that suggest different notions of the self (H&#252;ther 2018; Lewis 2016;  Seligman  and  Csikszentmihalyi  2014).  These  beliefs  and  values  can  also  be  spread  through meditation,  yoga  or  other  social  practices  that  encourage  lower  carbon  lifestyles  (Woiwode  and Woiwode  2019).  Another  channel  for  spreading  climate  concerns  is  sustainability  culture,  which  is premised on connecting people and communities, and has also benefited from the internet and digital technologies that support these connections (see e.g., Bradbury 2015; Scharmer 2018). The spread of this culture, in turn, has led to the creation of social fields that allow changes to happen ( (see e.g., Gillard et al. 2016) or  has promoted low-carbon thinking and related behavioural changes  </span><span id="id3190" class="s10">(O&#8217;Brien </span><span id="id3192" class="s10">2018;  Veciana  and  Ottmar  2018).

It  is  nonetheless  worth  highlighting  that  communication  networks  and  other  mechanisms promoting the spread of interpersonal communication that can spread pro-climate views may also lead to the proliferation of climate scepticism and denial (Leombruni 2015).

The review  suggests  that  there  are  several  differences  between  these  various  perspectives.  Whether individuals, organisations, markets or sociotechnical systems drive or undermine transitions is a key distinction. These differences have implications for the evidence these claims draw on in support of their arguments. For instance, some of the explanations tend to employ qualitative evidence to explain changes in attitudes at the individual or community levels as paving the way for broader changes to cultures and belief systems. Others assess how institutional arrangements can be reformed in order to align climate with the sustainable development agenda to enable a transition.  </span></div><div id="id3437"><span id="id3438" class="s10">While there are indeed significant differences between explanations, there are also important parallels.

Most explanations tend to underline the importance of synergies in aligning the  climate  with  broader  sustainability  agendas.  Most  importantly,  many  of  the  explanations  are complementary with the systems-level discussion in that they offer a broad framework, while economic, psychological and governance theories offer more specific insights.

It is also being realised that, under the Paris Agreement, climate change policies should be integrated into sustainable development agendas, while  the  UN  2030  Agenda  as  well  includes  SDG  13  on  climate  actions.  In  this  way,  both  UN agreements provide joint opportunities for systematic transitions in support of both climate change and </span><span id="id3562" class="s10">sustainable development. Achievement of the Paris Agreement&#8217;s goals will require a rapid and deep </span><span id="id3564" class="s10">worldwide  transition  in  all  GHG  emissions  sectors,  including  land-use,  energy,  industry,  buildings, transport and cities, as well as in consumption and behaviour (United Nations Environment Programme 2019). Meeting the goals of such a transformation requires that the long-term targets and pathways to fulfil the stabilization scenarios play an important role in guiding the direction and pathways of short-term transitions. There is therefore a need for long- and short-term policies and investment decisions to be closely coordinated. </span></div><div id="id3571"><span id="id3572" class="s10">In  the  context  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  countries  have  submitted  their  initial  plans  for  the decarbonization of their economies to the UNFCCC in the form of their so-called national determined contributions  (NDCs).  The  ambitions  of  the  NDCs  are  closely  related  to  the  ongoing  UNFCCC negotiations over the financial measures and forms of compensation. Although the Paris Agreement </span><span id="id3577" class="s10">emphasizes the links between climate policies and sustainable development, the UN&#8217;s 2030 Agenda </span><span id="id3579" class="s10">and the SDGs are not very well represented at present in the NDCs, according to Fuso Nerini et al. (2019). Very few of the NDCs include any reference to the SDGs, which  Fuso Nerini et al.  (2019) highlight as a barrier to the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement, which induces them to call for a more holistic policy approach. Campagnolo and Davide (2019) have assessed the impacts of the submitted NDCs on poverty eradication and inequalities of income based on empirical research and a global CGE model. One conclusion is that the NDCs of less developed countries would tend to reduce </span><span id="id3586" class="s10">poverty alleviation, but this can be offset if international financial support is provided for the mitigation actions.  </span></div><div id="id3589"><span id="id3590" class="s10">The alignment of climate-policy targets in the NDCs with sustainable development has been assessed by means of integrated assessment models (IAMs), macroeconomic and sectoral modelling.

It was thus concluded that some SDGs would be directly supported as a side benefit of the climate policy targets included in the NDCs, while other SDGs needed a special policy  design  going  beyond  narrow  climate  policy  objectives.  Iyer  et  al.  (2018)  also  assessed  the </span><span id="id3598" class="s10">regional distribution of efforts in terms of domestic mitigation costs and SDG impacts and concluded that the geographical distribution of mitigation costs and SDG benefits were not similar, so a special effort would be needed to match climate policies and policies to meet the SDGs. Accordingly, a national decision-making perspective suggests that SDGs should be integrated into national climate policies. </span></div><div id="id3675"></div><div id="id3794"><span id="id3795" class="s10">The NDCs submitted to the Paris Agreement have demonstrated a lack of progress in meeting the long-term temperature goals.

Given the close link between the SDGs and climate-change policies, the current obstacles in meeting the former could also be a barrier to realizing transitions to low-carbon societies. Conversely, opportunities to leverage the SDGs  could  in  many  cases  involve  climate  actions,  since  policies  enabling  climate  adaptation  and mitigation  could  also  support  food  and  energy  security  and  water  conservation  if  they  were  well designed (see the detailed discussion in the section on synergies and trade-offs between climate policies and meeting the SDGs in section 17.3.3.7, Chapter 3 and IPCC 2018).These findings point to a specific need to align economic and social development perspectives, climate change and natural systems. While all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and over time. These  priorities  are  strongly  linked  to  local  contexts  and  depend  on  which  dimension  of  the improvement in the well-being of people is considered to be the most urgent.

Areas of focal modelling include green  investments,  technological  change,  employment  generation  and  the  performance  of  policy instruments, such as green taxes, subsidies, emission permits, investments and finance. Short- and long-term macroeconomic models have been used to assess the impacts of such policy instruments. Jaumotte et al. (2021) analyse the economic impacts on net zero emissions by 2050 with a focus on short-term economic policies and the integration of climate policies such as CO</span><span id="id4001" class="s1031">2</span><span id="id4002" class="s10"> taxes with green reform policies. This  may  imply  the  co-creation  of  benefits  between  climate  policy  objectives,  and  macroeconomic policy goals such as employment creation.  </span></div><div id="id4006"><span id="id4007" class="s10">There is an emerging modelling literature focusing on the synergies and trade-offs between low-carbon development pathways and various aspects of sustainable development. The early literature, including that on IAMs, and macroeconomic and sectoral models mainly focused on the co-benefits of mitigation policies in terms of reduced air pollution, energy security and to some extent employment generation security (IPCC 2014, 2018c; WGIII AR6 Chapter 6). Some models have been developed further with assessments  of  a  broader  range  of  the  joint  benefits  of  mitigation,  health,  water,  land-use  and  food security (Clarke et al. 2014; IPCC 2014, 2018; Kolstad et al. 2014). According to WGIII AR6 Chapter 1, there is a need to incorporate issues and enablers further, including a wide range of non-climate risks, varying forms of innovation, possibilities for behavioural and social change, feasible policies and equity issues (Executive Summary in Chapter 1). </span></div><div id="id4018"><span id="id4019" class="s10">IAMs  and  macroeconomic  models typically  calculate  mitigation  costs  based  on the assumption that markets internalise externalities like GHG emissions through carbon prices (Barker et al. 2016; IEA 2017,  2019).  Yet,  there  are  legitimate  questions  to  be  asked  about  whether  carbon-pricing  will  be efficient if markets are inefficient (World Bank 2019). However, market inefficiencies are difficult to integrate into the models. How GHG emissions taxes would actually work is thus quite uncertain based on the modelling studies (Barker et al. 2016; Fontana and Sawyer 2016; Meyer et al. 2018). Despite these limitations, the use of GHG emission taxes as an effective instrument based on modelling results in practice has implications for public policies and private-sector investments.  </span></div><div id="id4028"><span id="id4029" class="s10">Despite the shortcomings of conventional economic thought and models, already pointed out, improved models have demonstrated new perspectives on how mitigation costs can be assessed in macroeconomic models. For instance, while a conventional perspective might suggest that climate-change mitigation costs  can  limit  investments  in  sustainability  because  they  reduce  the  productivity  of  capital  by increasing energy prices and the products in which energies are embodied, another perspective is that innovation can imply increases in efficiency and that the substitution of energy, material and labour can lead to the accumulation of capital and productivity gains. This appears to occur with innovations in end-use  energy  applications  generating  emissions  reductions  and  delivering  on  other  sustainable development  benefits  (Wilson  et  al.  2019).  Similarly,  IAM  models  have  been  applied  to  model  the potential  for  low  energy  demand  scenarios  associated  with  demand-side  innovations  in  the  service sector. Grubler et al.  (2018) have developed a climate-friendly, low-energy demand (LED) scenario </span><span id="id4041" class="s10">which assumes information technology innovations such as the internet of things (IoT) and induced social changes such as the sharing economy. Nonetheless there are still very important limits on the degree to which highly aggregated IAM models and macroeconomic models can integrate ethics, equity and several other key policy-relevant aspects of sustainable development (Easterlin et al. 2010; Koch 2020).  A  key  limitation  in  this  context  is  that,  while  all  countries  share  the  totality  of  the  SDGs, development  priorities differ across  countries  and  over time.  Moreover,  these  priorities are  strongly linked to  local  contexts,  and  this  can  only  be  reflected  directly  in  national  models  (Section  4.3.2  in Chapter 4). </span></div><div id="id4050"><span id="id4051" class="s10">An example of a project that assesses the economy-wide impacts of linking sustainable development </span><span id="id4053" class="s10">with deep decarbonization is the deep decarbonization project or DDPP (Bataille et al. 2016), which is undertaking a comparative assessment of studies of sixteen countries representing more than 74% of global energy-related  emissions  for  the  pathway to two-</span><span id="id4056" class="s10">degree  stabilization  scenarios.

Mitigation has implications for global economic inequalities through different channels and can  compound  or  lessen  inequalities,  avoid  impacts  and  create  co-benefits  that  reduce  inequalities (Section 3.6.4 in Chapter 3). There are, however, several challenges involved in balancing the dilemmas associated with meeting the SDGs, such as, for example, energy access, equity and sustainability.

However, mitigation policies can also cause higher food prices and thus increase the share of the global population at risk from hunger (SDG 2), while also relying on solid fuels (SDGs 7 &amp; 3) as side effects. It is then concluded in Section 3.7 of  Chapter 3, that these trade-offs can be balanced  through  targeted  support  measures  and/or  additional  SD  policies  (Bertram  et  al.  2018; Cameron et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2019).  </span></div><div id="id4661"><span id="id4662" class="s10">The World in 2050 Initiative (TWI) includes a comprehensive assessment of technologies, economies and  societies  embodied  in  the  SDGs  (IIASA  2018).

Net zero emissions imply that fossil fuel use is minimised and replaced by renewables and other low-carbon primary forms of energy, or that the residual emissions from fossil fuels are offset by carbon dioxide removal. The 1.5&#176;C scenario requires a 2-3% annual improvement rate in carbon intensities till 2050. The historical record only shows a slight improvement in the carbon intensity rate of global energy supplies, far from what is required to limit likely global warming to 2&#176;C, or limit warming to 1.5&#176;C with no or limited overshoot.  </span></div><div id="id4837"><span id="id4838" class="s10">The role of coal in the global energy system is changing fast.

The world should be prepared for a managed transition away from coal and should identify appropriate transition options for the future of coal, which can include both the penetration of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency (Shah et al. 2015).  </span></div><div id="id4850"><span id="id4851" class="s10">Phasing out fossil fuels from energy systems is technically possible and is estimated to be relatively low in cost (Chapter 6). The cost of low-carbon alternatives, including onshore and offshore wind, solar PV and electric vehicles, has been reduced substantially in recent years and has become competitive with fossil fuels (Shen et al. 2020). However, studies show that replacing fossil fuels with renewables can have major synergies and trade-offs with a broader agenda of sustainable development (Swain and Karimu 2020), including land use and food security (McCollum et al. 2018), decent jobs and economic growth  (Swain  and  Karimu  2020).  Clarke  et  al.  (2014:Table  6.7)  provides  detailed  mapping  of  the sectoral  co-benefits  and  adverse  side-impacts  of  and  links  to  transformation  pathways.  In  Section 17.3.3.7 in this chapter, this is supplemented with a mapping of the synergies and trade-offs between the deployment of renewable energy and the SDGs.  </span></div><div id="id4862"><span id="id4863" class="s10">The general conclusion is that the potential co-benefits of renewable energy end-use measures outweigh the  adverse impacts  in  most sectors and  in  relation to  the  SDGs,  though  this  is  not  the case for  the AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses) sectors. Some locally negative economic impacts can result in increased energy costs and competition over land areas and water resources. Some sectors may also experience increasing unemployment as a consequence of the transition process. Although the </span><span id="id4869" class="s10">deployment of renewable energy will generate a new industry and associated jobs and benefits in some areas and economies, these impacts will often not directly replace or offset activities in areas that have been heavily dependent on the fossil-fuel industry.  </span></div><div id="id4873"><span id="id4874" class="s10">The transition to low emission pathways will require policy efforts that also address the emissions that are locked into existing infrastructure like power plants, factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure already  in  use:  for  example,  today  coal-fired  power  plants  account  for  30%  of  all  energy-related emissions (IEA 2019). Over the past twenty years, Asia has accounted for 90% of all coal-fired capacity built  worldwide,  and  these  plants  have  potentially  long  operational  lifetimes  ahead  of  them.  In </span><span id="id4880" class="s10">developing economies in Asia, existing coal-fired plants are just twelve years old on average. There are three options for bringing down emissions from the existing stock of plants: to retrofit them with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) or biomass co-firing equipment; to repurpose them to focus on providing system adequacy and flexibility while reducing operations; and to retire them early. In the </span></div><div id="id4895"></div><div id="id5013"><span id="id5014" class="s10">IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, most of the 2080 GW of existing coal-fired capacity would be affected by one of these three options.  </span></div><div id="id5017"><span id="id5018" class="s10">Even though the transition away from fossil fuels is desirable and technically feasible, it is still largely constrained  by  existing  fossil  fuel-</span><span id="id5020" class="s10">based  infrastructure  and  stranded  investments.

Kefford et al. (2018) assess the early retirement of fossil-fuel power plants in the US, EU, China and India based on the IEA 2&#176;C scenario and conclude that a massive early retirement of coal-fired power plants is needed, and that two to three standard 500 MW generators will need to come offline every week for fifteen years. This high rate is the result of a very large deployment of coal-fired power plants from 2004 to 2012. The early phasing out of this infrastructure will result in a significant share of stranded assets (Ansari and Holz 2020) with an impact on workers, local communities, companies and governments (van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020). The challenge is thus to manage a transition which delivers the rapid phasing out of existing fossil fuel-based infrastructure while also developing a new energy system based on low-carbon alternatives within a very short window of opportunity. </span></div><div id="id5034"><span id="id5035" class="s10">Chapter 6 similarly concludes that the transition towards a high penetration of renewable systems faces various  challenges  in  the  technical,  environmental  and  socio-economic  fields.

The long-term policy should target support to the local economy and workers to move beyond coal, including a strategic plan to transform the impacted area, investment  in  local  infrastructure  and  education,  and  preference  policies  to  incentivize  emerging businesses.

A  rapid transition away from coal is critical for China to reach the peak in its emissions (Cui et al. 2019).

Many economies in transition and countries dependent on fossil fuels are going through turbulent times where asset and transition management will be critical  (UNEP/SEI 2020). However, COVID-19  provides  a  foretaste  of  what  a  low-carbon  transition  could  look like,  especially  if  assets </span><span id="id5488" class="s10">become stranded in an effort to respond to the call for action in &#8216;building back better&#8217; and putting clean </span><span id="id5490" class="s10">energy  jobs  and  the  just  transition  at  the  heart  of  the  post-COVID-19  recovery  (IEA  2020;  United Nations General Assembly 2021).

Second, failure to recognize the threat from stranded assets will result in new assets becoming stranded (Rempel and Gupta 2021). Hence, the momentum towards a transformational push is resting on a new opportunity ushered in by COVID-19 to emphasize the urgency for a new departure towards rapid emissions reductions (Cronin et al. 2021).  </span></div><div id="id5509"></div><div id="id5629"><span id="id5630" class="s10">The stranded assets narrative has focused overwhelmingly on consumption  by companies: not much emphasis has been placed on the commercialisation- and investment-related aspects. In addition, other carbon-intensive activities can also run the risk of being stranded, such as cement, petrochemicals, steel and aviation  (Baron and David 2015). This is why stranded assets  are  often referred to as having a cascading impact on several other sectors. </span></div><div id="id5636"><span id="id5637" class="s10">Transitions  are  broad-based  and  complex,  involving  governance  structures,  institutions  and  climate vulnerabilities,  and there is  need to  include  historical responsibility,  resource  intensity  and  capacity differentials, thus relegating the debate across simplistic binary lines of developed versus developing countries (Carney 2016). Hence, transition processes will have to respond to several preconditions and structural inequalities related to climate finance, energy poverty, vulnerabilities and the broader macro-economic implications associated with managing the debt burden, fiscal deficits and uneven terms of development in developing countries. In addition to structural inequalities, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted energy and food systems to and reduced the speed at which developing countries can procure new low-carbon technologies and decouple economic growth from fossil fuels (Winkler 2020). For instance, global supply-chain transition costs might be lower when compared to in-country supply  chains,  as  became  evident  when  COVID-19  created  further  disruption  to  renewable  energy projects (Cronin et al. 2021). Moreover, developing countries can experience difficulties in phasing out old technologies, especially if the latter has a cost disadvantage, has not benefitted from an established </span><span id="id5651" class="s10">track record and its performance is uncertain (Bos and Gupta 2019).

In short, the transition to a low carbon development must consider the challenges of renewable energy  penetration  and  existing  energy-related  vulnerabilities  and  inequalities.  There  are  power asymmetries between first-comers and latecomers, especially in cases where mature technologies can be located in countries with less stringent laws and standards. Carbon leakage has implications for just transitions, as carbon-intensive industries can move their dirty industries to developing countries as a way of outsourcing the production of carbon (Bos and Gupta 2019; UNU-INRA 2020, Denton et al, 2021). When the challenge of climate mitigation is transferred to developing countries in the form of carbon leakage, the risks  of carbon lock-in for developing countries are heightened  (Bos and Gupta 2019). </span></div><div id="id5668"><span id="id5669" class="s10">Overcoming the carbon lock-in is not simply a matter of the right policies or switching to low-carbon technologies.

The impacts of climate change  and  the  mitigation  burdens  are  experienced  differently  by  different  social  actors,  with indigenous  communities  facing  multiple  threats  and  being  subjected  to  unequal  power  dynamics (Sovacool 2021).  </span></div><div id="id5852"><span id="id5853" class="s10">Nonetheless, the production of fossil fuels is central to many economies with numerous development </span><span id="id5855" class="s10">implications related to rents associated with export revenues, energy security and poverty alleviation </span><span id="id5857" class="s10">(Lazarus and van Asselt 2018). The central question is who decides which types of carbon should be burnable or non-burnable. Hence, social equality is at the heart of the transition process, but it falls short of a response on how to chart a new road map towards carbon neutrality, especially given that fossil-fuel  producers and investors  tend to  belong  to  large, powerful companies and  wield  a  great  deal  of influence and power, especially when their entrenched interests are at stake (Lazarus and van Asselt 2018).

These failed concessions and disruptions have implications for the just transition, especially in developing countries without the financial ability to pull out of fossil fuels and to diversify with the same urgency as the industrialized nations (Peszko et al. 2020). For instance, in South Africa, which is seeking to divest away from coal and decarbonize its energy sector, if the transition is not properly managed, this could lead to a loss in  revenue of R1.8 trillion  (USD</span><span id="id6033" class="s10">125  billion),  thus  compromising  the  government&#8217;s  ability  to  support  social  spending </span><span id="id6035" class="s10">(Huxham  et  al.  2019).

It emphasizes the key principles of respect and dignity for vulnerable groups, the creation of decent jobs, social protection, employment rights, fairness in energy access and use, and social dialogue and democratic consultation with relevant stakeholders, whilst coping with the effects of asset-stranding or the transition to green and clean economies. The concept has come under increased scrutiny, with its protagonists emphasizing the need to focus on the equality of the transition, not simply on its speed (Forsyth 2014). The emphasis on justice is also gaining in momentum, with a growing recognition that the sustainability transition is about justice in the transition and not simply </span><span id="id6275" class="s10">about economics (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Swilling, M.

This link with stranded assets is important, but it may be overlooked, as countries whose assets are becoming stranded may not have the relevant resources, knowledge, autonomy or agency to design  a  fresh  orientation  or  decide  on  the  transition.  In  addition,  some  developing  countries  are dependent not only on fossil-fuel revenues, but also on foreign exchange earnings from exports. This dependence  comes  into  sharp  focus  when  one  considers  that  30%  of  </span><span id="id6289" class="s10">the  Malaysian  government&#8217;s </span><span id="id6291" class="s10">revenues are linked to petroleum products, and that Mozambique, by exploiting its newly discovered natural-gas reserves, can earn </span><span id="id6293" class="s10">seven times the country&#8217;s </span><span id="id6294" class="s10">current GDP over a period of 25 years (Cronin et al. 2021). Thus, any attempt to accelerate the transition to low-carbon development must take into account  foreign  exchange,  domestic  revenue  and  employment  generation,  which  are  precisely  what ensure the attractiveness of fossil-fuel industries (Addison and Roe 2018).  </span></div><div id="id6299"><span id="id6300" class="s10">Energy use and its deployment are sovereign matters.

Therefore,  the  resources </span><span id="id6304" class="s10">required to enable a just transition are predicated on good leadership and governance institutions that will support quality and justice-based transitions. Beyond energy systems, changes to land systems can benefit from sustainable land management in ways that will reduce the pressure on land for food and at the  same  time  support  carbon  storage.  With  land  coming  under  increased  pressure,  land  and  forest management  are  critical  for  carbon  sequestration,  as  well  as  other  ecosystem  benefits.  Extractive processes have impacts on land, and often there are few if any redistributive benefits for communities in  regions  where extraction  takes  place.

Consequently, the  transition  imperative  reduces the  scope  for local  priority-setting and ignores the additional risks faced by countries with the least capacity to adapt. Equally, the </span></div><div id="id6329"></div><div id="id6442"><span id="id6443" class="s10">&#8216;</span><span id="id6444" class="s10">just t</span><span id="id6445" class="s10">ransition&#8217; is often seen through the </span><span id="id6446" class="s10">prism of job losses and the attendant retooling and reskilling imperatives necessary to re-dynamize local businesses, especially those that may fail as a result of mine closures. It is equally important to consider current disparities in knowledge and capacity which could maintain the existing inequalities in the global regional distribution of costs and benefits. One striking example is the manufacturing of PV in India when compared to manufacturing PV in China. In China, manufacturing  costs  are  lower  than in  India, as are  import tariffs  (Behuria 2020).  Similarly, a  solar industry might have greater development prospects in one region than another given existing regional disparities in human capital, infrastructure, finance and technological development (Cronin et al. 2021).  </span></div><div id="id6455"><span id="id6456" class="s10">Low-carbon transitions and equality implications will depend on local contexts, regional priorities, the points of departure of different countries in the transition and the speed at which they will want to travel. Hence, timing and scope are important elements that are associated more with a quality transition than a race to the bottom. To date the debate has had some obvious blind spots, not least considerations of power, politics and political economy (Denton et al, 2021). Certainly, the transition will create winners and  losers,  as  well  as  stakeholders  that  can  frame  their  economic  interests  so  as  to  determine  the orientation, pace, timing and scope of the transition.  </span></div><div id="id6464"><span id="id6465" class="s10">The  determination  of  a  just  transition  is  complex  and  not  simply  dependent  on  the  allocation  of perceived risks or solutions, but rather on how risks and solutions are defined (Forsyth 2014). Acting urgently to achieve environmental solutions or meet transition imperatives has certain risks given the </span><span id="id6469" class="s10">need to go beyond commonplace definitions of the just transition by emphasizing the distributive or </span><span id="id6471" class="s10">procedural aspects. The framing of policies to align with fast and low-cost mitigation without paying sufficient attention to social and economic resilience creates its own potential risks and can enhance social  vulnerability  rather  than  address  it.  The  need  to  distribute  climate-change  solutions  must  not delegitimise appropriate economic growth strategies, nor indeed create the additional risks of policy imposition. Perceptions of justice with regard to environmental problems and solutions matter equally. Hence, the types of transition pathway that are chosen may have equality implications. Mitigation at all costs, if </span><span id="id6478" class="s10">done &#8220;cheaply and crudely&#8221;</span><span id="id6479" class="s10">, can create additional problems for social justice and inclusive development (Forsyth 2014). </span></div><div id="id6483"><span id="id6484" class="s10">The  assumption  that  the  benefits  of  mitigation  are  enough  to  offset  trade-offs  with  other  policy objectives can be questioned.

Hence the emphasis on the transition resulting from mitigation should be placed not only on speed or cost effectiveness, but also on legitimacy of the actions, and whether the transition is well designed or not. In short, justice is not always a shorthand for acting ethically, but rather a point of reasoning on what is considered legitimate. Planning for the transition often discounts human rights and social inclusivity that can occur as the result of a rapid transition.

In the short run, where fossil-fuel sources make up a significant share of the global energy grid, climate impacts related to water availability and water temperatures will affect thermoelectric power generation, which relies mainly on water cooling (Larsen and Drews 2019; Pan et al. 2018); water is also used for pollution and dust control, cleaning etc. (Larsen et al. 2019).

Also,  an  increasing  share  of  renewables  within desalination, as well as improved irrigation efficiencies, have been shown to potentially improve the inter-sectorial WEFN water balance (Lohrmann et al. 2019). Also, an increasing share of renewables on  connection  with  desalination,  as  well  as  improved  irrigation  efficiencies,  have  been  shown  to potentially  improve  the  inter-sectorial  WEFN  water  balance  (Caldera  and  Breyer  2020).  Some  less dominant renewable-energy technologies do use water for cooling, such as geothermal energy and solar CSP, if wet cooling is employed. Despite the general detachment from water resources, wind and solar PV, for example, are highly dependent on climate-change patterns, including variability depending on future energy-storage capacities and on-/off-grid solutions (Schlott et al. 2018). Furthermore, regardless of whether or not they are based on renewables, climate change will affect energy usage across sectors, such as heating and cooling in the building stock.

Alongside the global increase in hydropower potential, the global mean water-discharge cooling capacity, which also relates to water temperatures, experiences a decrease of 4.5% to 15% across the scenarios. In very general and global terms, when combined, these changes support the shift towards sources  of renewable  energy,  including hydropower,  in the energy mix.  When it comes to  ensuring stability in the management of the electricity grid, hydro-climatological extremes have the potential to pose vast difficulties in certain regions and/or seasons depending on the nature of the energy mix (Van Vliet et al. 2016b). Van Vliet et al. (2016a) showed significant reductions in both thermoelectric and </span><span id="id7677" class="s10">hydropower  electricity  capacities,  exemplified  by  the  2003  European  drought,  which  resulted  in reductions of 4.7% and 6.6% respectively.  </span></div><div id="id7750"></div><div id="id7870"><span id="id7871" class="s10">The energy sector is vulnerable to production losses caused mainly by heatwaves and droughts, whereas </span><span id="id7873" class="s10">coastal  and  fluvial  floods  are  also  responsible  for  a  large  relative  share  of  the  energy  sector&#8217;s </span><span id="id7875" class="s10">vulnerability, as assessed by (Forzieri et al. 2018) for Europe in 2100. In total, heatwaves and droughts will be responsible for 94% of the damage costs to the European energy system compared to 40% today. Similarly,  (Craig  et  al.  2018)  show  that,  despite  potentially  minor  spatiotemporally  aggregated differences for various energy-system components, such as demand, thermoelectric power, wind etc., the aggregated impact of climate change across these components will cause a significant impact on the energy system, as currently exemplified by the USA. In terms of investments and management, it is important  to  unravel  these  cross-component  relations  in  light  of  the  projected  nature  of  the  future climate.  </span></div><div id="id7884"><span id="id7885" class="s10">In the ongoing transition towards renewable sources of energy (see also Chapters 3, 4 and 6), the impact of the hydro-climate on energy production continues to be highly relevant (Jones and Warner 2016). As the shares of thermoelectric energy production in the energy grid go down along with the introduction of  thermoelectric  cooling  technologies  using  smaller  amounts  of  water,  new  energy  sources  and technologies are being introduced, and existing sources scaled up. Of these, hydropower, wind and solar energy are the key energy sources currently and will be in the near future, making up 2.5% and 1.8% of the total global primary energy supply in 2017 respectively (IEA 2019). Wind and solar energy are directly independent of water in themselves, but are dependent on atmospheric conditions related to processes that also drive the water balance and circulation. Hydropower, on the other hand, is directly influenced by and dependent on the supply of water, while at the same time being an essential counter-component to seasonality and climatological variation, as well as to current and future demand curves and diurnal variations, as against wind and solar energy (De Barbosa et al. 2017). </span></div><div id="id7898"><span id="id7899" class="s10">Furthermore, policy instruments in power-system management, here exemplified by hydropower in a climate-change scenario, have been shown to enhance energy production during droughts (Gjorgiev and Sansavini 2018). The significant influence of variation in the planning of renewable energy for the 21</span><span id="id7902" class="s1031">st </span><span id="id7904" class="s10">century  has  also  been  highlighted  by  (Bloomfield  et al.  2016).  At the  same time,  the integration  of renewables  must  account  for  lower  thermoelectric  efficiencies  and  capacities  due  to  increases  in temperature (van Vliet et al. 2016), power-plant closures during extreme weather events due to a lack of cooling capacity (Forzieri et al. 2018) and further efficiency reductions and penalties following the implementation of CCS technologies in the effort to reach the GHG mitigation targets  (Byers et al. 2015).  However,  more  recent  studies  find  more  promising  amounts  of  water  being  used  for  energy conversion (IEAGHG 2020; Magneschi et al. 2017).  </span></div><div id="id7912"><span id="id7913" class="s10">The  extraction,  distribution  and  wastewater  processes  of  anthropogenic  water-management  systems similarly  use  vast  amounts  of  energy,  making  the  proper  management  of  water  essential  to  reduce energy usage and GHG emissions (Nair et al. 2014 and Chapter 11). One study reports that the water sector accounts for 5% of total US GHG emissions (Rothausen and Conway 2011). Within the WEFN, there is an obvious trade-off between water availability and food production, competing demands that pose a risk to the supply of the basic commodities of food, energy and water in line with the SDGs (Bleischwitz et  al.  2018;  Gao  et al.  2019),  all  of  which  has the  potential  for inter-sectorial  or inter-</span><span id="id7921" class="s10">regional conflicts (Froese and Schilling 2019). Currently, 24% of the global population live in regions with constant water-scarce food production, and 19% experience occasional water scarcities (Kummu et al. 2014). To counterbalance the demand for food and comestibles in regions that experience constant or intermittent supplies, transportation is needed, which in itself requires suitable infrastructure, energy supplies, a well-functioning trading environment and support policies. Of the 2.6 billion people who experience constant or occasional water scarcities in food production, 55% rely on international trade, 21% on domestic trade and the remainder on water stocks (Kummu et al. 2014).  </span></div><div id="id7929"><span id="id7930" class="s10">The  relations  between  the  influence  of  hydro-climatic  variability,  socio-economic  conditions  and patterns of water scarcity have been addressed by (Veldkamp et al. 2015). A key finding of this study </span><span id="id7933" class="s10">was the ability of the hydro-climate and the socio-economy to interact, enforcing or attenuating each other,  though  with  the  former  acting  as  the  key  immediate  driver,  and  the  influence  of  the  latter emerging after six to ten years.  </span></div><div id="id7947"></div><div id="id8062"><span id="id8063" class="s10">The trade-offs between competing demands have been investigated on a continental scale in the US Great Plains, highlighting the influence of irrigation in mitigating reductions in crop yields (Zhang et al. 2018b). Despite crop-yield reductions of 50% in dry years compared to wet years, a key conclusion was that the irrigation should be counterbalanced against general water and energy savings within the context  of  trade-offs.  In  East  Asia,  the  WEFN  has  been  quantified,  highlighting  obvious  trade-offs between economic growth, environmental issues and food security (White et al. 2018). This same study also highlights the concept of a virtual WEFN that includes water embodied within products that are traded and shipped. (Liu et al. 2019) find an urgent need for proper assessment methods, including of trade within the WEFN, due to the significant resource allocations. </span></div><div id="id8073"><span id="id8074" class="s10">Within the WEFN, the implementation of policies to achieve low stabilisation targets is strongly linked to  sustainable  development  within  the  water  sector  with  regard  to  water  management  and  water conservation,  indicating  that  additional  coherence  in  policies  affecting  the  water,  energy  and  food sectors (among others) will be critical in achieving the SDGs  see also Chapter 7). Subsidized fertilizers, energy and crops can drive unsustainable levels of water usage and pollution in agriculture. More than </span><span id="id8080" class="s10">half the world&#8217;s population, roughly 4.3 billion people in 2016, live in areas where the demand for water </span><span id="id8082" class="s10">resources outstrips sustainable supplies for at least part of the year. Irrigated agriculture is already using around 70% of the available freshwater, and the large seasonal variations in water supply and the needs of different crops can create conflicts between water needs across sectors at different time scales (Wada </span><span id="id8086" class="s10">et al. 2016). However, as there is little potential for increasing irrigation or expanding cropland (Steffen </span><span id="id8088" class="s10">et  al.  2015),  gaps  in  food  production  gaps  must  be  closed  by  increasing  productivity  and  cropping densities  on  currently  harvested  land  by  increasing  either  rain-fed  yields  or  water-use  efficiency (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012).  </span></div><div id="id8092"><span id="id8093" class="s10">It  has  been  argued  that  applying  an  integrated  approach  to  water-energy-climate-food  resource management and policy-making is highly beneficial in properly addressing the co-benefits and trade-offs (Brouwer et al. 2018; Howells et al. 2013), accommodating the SDGs (Rasul 2016) and in general assessing  enabling  strategies  to  improve  resource  efficiency  (Dai  et  al.  2018).  For  an  integrated approach to analysing the WEFN, a number of modelling approaches, tools and frameworks have been proposed (Brouwer et al. 2018; de Strasser et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2019; Larsen et al. 2019; Smajgl et al. 2016), often involving multi-objective calibration. Such tools enable decision-makers to evaluate the optimal  water-allocation  and  energy-saving  solutions  for  the  specific  geography  in  question.  As  an example,  (Scott 2011)  found  the  higher transportability  of  electricity,  compared  to  water, pivotal in water-energy adaptation solutions in the USA, while arguing for the additional coordination of water and energy policies as a key instrument in balancing the trade-offs.  </span></div><div id="id8105"><span id="id8106" class="s10">Common to all these integrated efforts is the challenge involved in making comparisons across studies due to the  combined  complexities  of  assumptions, model  codes, regions,  variables,  forcings  etc.  To accommodate these challenges, (Larsen et al. 2019) suggest employing shared criteria and forcing data to enable cross-model comparisons and uncertainty estimates, as also highlighted by (Brouwer et al. </span><span id="id8111" class="s10">2018). Other limitations in current WEFN research are partial system descriptions, the failure to address uncertainties, system boundaries, and evaluation methods and metrics (Zhang et al. 2018b). The lack of proper access to WEFN data and data quality has been highlighted by </span><span id="id8114" class="s10">(D&#8217;Odorico et al. 2018; Larsen </span><span id="id8116" class="s10">et al. 2019). Furthermore, gaps have been identified between theory and end-user applications in the lack of any focus on food nutritional values as opposed to calories alone, in the understanding of water availability  in  relation  to  management  practices,  in  integrating  new  energy  technologies  and  in  the resulting environmental issues </span><span id="id8120" class="s10">(D&#8217;Odorico et al. 2018)</span><span id="id8121" class="s10">.  </span></div><div id="id8123"><span id="id8124" class="s10">Therefore, looking ahead, future fields of WEFN research should provide greater insights into all these aspects.

In this section, we assess the synergies and  trade-offs  between  mitigation  options  and  the  SDGs,  with  a  specific  focus  on  asking  whether economic growth and employment creation can work jointly with climate actions and other SDGs in least developed and developing countries.

International climate finance has been totally dominated by mitigation projects. </span></div><div id="id9743"></div><div id="id9801"><span id="id9802" class="s10">Those who were interviewed were asked about their willingness to change this balance and to commit more resources to projects that address both climate-change mitigation and adaptation. More than two-thirds of those interviewed, however, raised concerns that integrated projects could be too complicated and that a greater alignment of financial models across different policy domains could entail greater financial  risks.  Another  barrier  mentioned  in  respect  of  finance  was  that  mitigation  projects  were primarily aimed at GHG emissions reductions, while adaptation projects had more national benefits and were  also  more  suitable  for  community  development  and  promoting  equality  and  fairness.  In  an assessment of 201 projects in the forestry and agricultural sectors in the tropics Kongsager et al. (2016), found that a majority of the projects contributed to both adaptation and mitigation or at least had the potential to do so, despite the separation between these two objectives by international and national institutions. </span></div><div id="id9814"><span id="id9815" class="s102">17.3.3.6 Cross-sectoral digitalization  </span><span id="id9817" class="s10">In  this  section,  the  potential  role  of  digitalization  as  a  facilitator  of  a  fast  transition  to  sustainable development and low emission pathways is assessed based on sectoral examples. The contributions of digital technology could contribute to efficiency improvements, cross-sectoral coordination, including new IT services, and decreasing resource use, implying several synergies with the SDGs, as well as trade-offs,  for  example,  in  relation  to  reduced  employment,  increasing  energy  demand  and  the increasing demand for services, possibly increasing GHG emissions. </span></div><div id="id9825"><span id="id9826" class="s10">The  COVID-19  pandemic  caused  radical  temporary  breaks  with  past  energy  use  trends.

Recovering from the pandemic with energy-efficient practices embedded in new patterns of travel, work, consumption and production reduces climate mitigation challenges (Kikstra et al. 2021). The potential of digital contact-tracing to slow the spread of a virus had been quietly explored for over a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic thrust the technology into the spotlight (Cebrian 2021). The COVID-19 crisis is among the most disruptive events in recent decades and has had consequences for consumer behaviour. During the lockdowns in most countries, consumers have turned to online shopping for food products, personal hygiene and disinfection (Cruz-C&#225;rdenas et al. 2021), making society more digitally literate. </span></div><div id="id9837"><span id="id9838" class="s10">The cost of new services provided by digitalization can be high, and this could imply barriers for low-income  countries  in  joining  new  global  information  sharing  systems  and  markets.

It found that efficiency improvements, reduced resource-consumption  and  new  services  can  support  the  SDGs,  but  also  that  there  were  challenges, including in relation to equality, facing the least developed and developing countries because of their low level of access to technologies. The necessary preconditions for successful digital transformation include  prosperity,  social  inclusion,  environmental  sustainability,  protection  of  jobs  and  good governance  of  sustainability  transitions.  One  negative  impact  of  digitalisation  could  be the  rebound effects,  where  easier  access  to  services  could  increase  demand  and  with  it  GHG  emissions. Digitalization in the manufacturing sector could also provide a comparative advantage to developed countries  due  to  the  falling  importance  of  labour  costs,  while  the  barriers  to  emerging  economies seeking to enter global markets could accordingly be increased. </span></div><div id="id10072"><span id="id10073" class="s10">In  respect  of  governance,  Krishnan  et  al.  (2020)  point  out  that  the  creation  of  synergies  between sustainable development and low-emission urbanization based on digitalization could face barriers in the form of inadequate knowledge of structures and value creation through ecosystems that would need to  be  addressed  by  means  of  smart  digitalizing,  requiring  organizational  measures  to  support transformation processes. </span></div><div id="id10079"><span id="id10080" class="s10">Urban areas are one of the main arenas for new digital solutions due to rapid urbanization rates and high concentrations of settlements, businesses and supply systems, which offer great potential for large-scale </span><span id="id10083" class="s10">digital systems. The emergence of smart cities has supported the uptake of smart integrated energy, </span><span id="id10085" class="s10">transportation, water and waste-management systems, while synergies have been created in terms of more flexible and efficient systems. In its 2018 Policy and Action document, the Japanese Business Federation (Keidanren) launched Society 5.0, which include plans for smart city development (Carraz and Yuko 2019; Narvaez Rojas et al. 2021). To achieve smart cities, Society 5.0 aimed to facilitate diverse  lifestyles  and  business  success,  while  the  quality  of  life  offered  by  these  options  will  be enhanced. It also aims to offer high-standard medical and educational services. Autonomous vehicles will be available and integrated with smart grid systems in order to facilitate mobility and flexibility in energy  supply  with  a  high  share  of  renewable  energy.  The  energy  system  will  include  microgrids, renewable with demand-side controls aligned with local conditions. </span></div><div id="id10095"><span id="id10096" class="s10">Chapter 6 of this report on &#8220;Energy Systems&#8221; points out that there are many smart energy options with </span><span id="id10098" class="s10">the  potential  to  support  sustainable  development  by  facilitating  the  integration  of  high  shares  of fluctuating renewable energy in electricity systems, potentially storing energy in EV batteries or fuel cells, and applying load shifting by varying prices over time.

Increasing  GHG  emissions  could  be  the  result,  but  if  low-income consumers  are  given  faster  access  to  affordable  energy,  this  could  agree  with  the  SDGs,  making  it </span><span id="id10109" class="s10">desirable to integrate policies targeting mitigation. </span></div><div id="id10111"><span id="id10112" class="s10">Section  10.1.2  in  Chapter  10  discusses  how  the  sharing  economy,  which,  for  example,  could  be facilitated by ICT platforms, could influence both mitigation and the SDGs. On the one hand, sharing has  the  potential  to  save transport  emissions, especially  if  EVs  are supplied  with  decarbonised  grid electricity. However, an increase in transport emissions could result from this if increasing demand and higher comfort levels are facilitated, for example, by making access to EVs relatively easy compared with mass transit. Another possible trade-off is that the supply of public transport services would be limited to the elderly and other user groups.  </span></div><div id="id10120"><span id="id10121" class="s10">Green  innovation  in  agriculture  is  another  emerging  area  in  which  digitalization  is  making  huge progress. From the perspective of water provision, weather data can be used to predict rain amounts so that farmers can better manage the application of farm chemicals to minimize polluting aquifers and surface water systems used for drinking water.

On  the  supply  side,  remote  tele-control  systems  and  efficient  irrigation technologies enable farmers to control and optimize the quantity and timing of water applications, while minimizing  the  energy-consumption  trade-offs  of  pressurized  irrigation  in  both  rural  and  urban agricultural contexts (Germer et al. 2011; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2009).  </span></div><div id="id10200"><span id="id10201" class="s10">Technology-driven  precision  agriculture,  which  combines  geomorphology,  satellite  imagery,  global positioning  and  smart  sensors,  enables  enormous  increases  in  efficiency  and  productivity.  Taken together, these technologies provide farmers with a decision-support system in real time for the whole farm. Arguably, the world could feed the projected rise in population without radical changes to current agricultural practices if food waste can be minimized or eliminated. Digital technologies will contribute to minimizing these losses through increased efficiencies in supply chains, better shipping and transit systems, and improved refrigeration.</span></div><div id="id10211"><span id="id10212" class="s10">In  conclusion,  in  most  cases  digitalization  options  may  have  both  positive  synergistic  impacts  on mitigation and the SDGs and some negative trade-offs.

Digital platforms for the sharing economy could have both positive and negative impacts depending on the goods and services that are actually exchanged (see Cross Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7).

The conclusion  is  that  15-25%  additional  energy  will  be  required  by  CCS  technologies  compared  with conventional plants, implying that production costs could increase significantly.

In particular,  mitigation  options  in  relation  to  land-use,  such  as  afforestation  and  reforestation  and bioenergy crops, can in some cases imply trade-offs with access to food and local sharing of benefits, but synergies can also exist if proper land management and cross-sectoral policies take sustainable land-</span><span id="id11068" class="s10">use into account. The impacts and trade-offs for this sector are highly scale- and context-dependent, so </span><span id="id11070" class="s10">the final outcome of mitigation policies should be considered in detail.  </span></div><div id="id11072"><span id="id11073" class="s10">The  urban  systems  and  transportation  could  potentially  achieve  many  synergies  between  mitigation policies and the SDGs, but integrated planning and infrastructure management are critical to avoiding trade-offs. Similarly, the buildings sector and industry have identified many potential synergies between mitigation options and the SDGs, but that raises issues related to the costs of new technologies, and in relation to households and buildings important equity issues are emerging in relation to the ability of low-income  groups  to  afford  the  introduction  of  new  technologies.  Altogether  these  cross-sectoral conclusions call for a need to support policies that aid coordination between different sectoral domains and  that  include  context-specific  assessments  of  the  sharing  of  benefits  and  costs  related  to  the implementation of mitigation options.  </span></div><div id="id11083"><span id="id11084" class="s0">17.4</span><span id="id11086" class="s0">Key barriers and enablers of the transition: synthesizing results  </span></div><div id="id11088"><span id="id11089" class="s10">This section provides a deep and broad synthesis of theory (section 17.2) and evidence (section 17.3) in  order  to  identify  the  conditions  that  either  enable or  inhibit  transitions  to  sustainable  low-carbon futures. Following the literature on sustainability transitions (see Cross-chapter Box 12 on Transition Dynamics), the section finds that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing such transitions.  Rather,  marked  departures  from  business  as  usual  typically  involve  several  factors, </span><span id="id11095" class="s10">including technological innovations, shifts in markets, concerted efforts by scientists and civil-society organizations to raise awareness of the costs of continued emissions, social movements, policies and governance arrangements, and changes in belief systems and values.  </span></div><div id="id11099"><span id="id11100" class="s10">All of this comes together in a co-evolutionary process that has unfolded globally, internationally and locally over several decades (Hansen and Nygaard 2014; Rogge et al. 2017; Sorman et al. 2020), and that  may  be  guided  or  facilitated  by  interventions  that  target  leverage  points  in  the  underlying development path (Burch and Di Bella 2021; Leventon et al. 2021). While transitions necessarily follow context-specific trajectories, more general lessons can be drawn by comparing the empirical details with </span><span id="id11106" class="s10">both system-level and narrower explanations of change.  </span></div><div id="id11108"><span id="id11109" class="s10">Sections 17.2 and 17.3 show that transitions often face multiple barriers, including infrastructure lock-in, behavioural, cultural and institutional inertia (Markard et al. 2020), trade-offs between transitions </span></div><div id="id11185"></div><div id="id11305"><span id="id11306" class="s10">and other social or political priorities (Chu 2016), cost and a reliable (and growing) supply of renewable energy  technologies  and  constituent  materials  (Garc&#237;a-Olivares  et  al.  2018).  Transitions  away  from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy-based systems, for instance, will require significant land-use decisions to avoid negative trade-offs with biodiversity and food security (Capell&#225;n-P&#233;rez et al. 2017). Previous sections underline a related need to move be</span><span id="id11311" class="s10">yond focusing on &#8220;rational&#8221; assessments of the </span><span id="id11313" class="s10">costs and benefits of policies and technologies to involve people at all levels in order to overcome these multiple  barriers.  For  example,  the  case  of  coal-fired  power  in  China  (section  17.3)  shows  that  a transition to a lower carbon system is unlikely to happen even if models find it technically feasible and cost-effective.  Rather,  achieving  a  transition  requires  breaking  locked-in  high-carbon  technological trajectories,  path  dependencies  and  resistance  to  change  from  the  industries  and  actors  that  are benefiting from the current system (Rogge et al. 2017). Lock-in effects may be weaker in sectors and policy areas where fewer technologies exist, potentially opening the door to innovations that embed the climate  in  broader  sustainability  objectives  (e.g.,  technologies  and  innovations  that  support  the integration of food, water and energy goals). Such effects may still happen when there are significant information asymmetries and high-cost barriers to action, as can occur when working across multiple climate and development-related sectors (Kemp and Never 2017).  </span></div><div id="id11325"><span id="id11326" class="s10">However,  the  same  conditions  that  may  serve  to  impede  a  transition  (i.e.,  organizational  structure, behaviour, technological lock-in) </span><span id="id11328" class="s10">can also be &#8216;flipped&#8217; to enable it</span><span id="id11329" class="s10"> (Burch 2010; Lee et al. 2017), while the framing of policies that are relevant to the sustainable development agenda can also create a stronger </span><span id="id11332" class="s10">basis and stronger policy support. The technological developments and broader cultural changes that </span><span id="id11334" class="s10">may  generate  new  social  demands  on  infrastructure  to  contribute  to  sustainable  development  will involve a process of social learning and awareness building (Naber et al. 2017; Sengers et al. 2019). However, it is also important to note that strong shocks to these systems, including accelerated climate-change impacts, economic crises and political changes, may provide crucial openings for accelerated transitions to sustainable systems through fundamental institutional changes (Broto et al. 2014). The global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  one  such  shock  that  has  sparked  widespread  conversations  about recovery  that  is  fundamentally  more  sustainable,  equitable  and  resilient  (McNeely  and  Munasinghe 2021). Key enabling conditions appear to be individual and collective actions, including leadership and education; financial, material, social and technical drivers that foster innovation; robust national and regional innovation systems that enhance technological diffusion (Wieczorek 2018); supportive policy and governance dynamics at multiple levels that permit both agility and coherence (see e.g. G&#246;pel et al. 2016); measures to recognize and address the challenges to equality inherent in the transition; and long-range,  holistic  planning  that  explicitly  seeks  synergies  between  climate  change  and  sustainable development while avoiding trade-offs. The sections that follow seek to assess and integrate these key categories  of  the  barriers  to  and  enablers  of  an  accelerated  transition  to  sustainable  development pathways.  </span></div><div id="id11351"><span id="id11352" class="s1">17.4.1</span><span id="id11354" class="s1">Behavioural and lifestyle changes </span></div><div id="id11356"><span id="id11357" class="s10">Transitions  toward  more  sustainable  development  pathways  are  both  an  individual  and  a  collective challenge, requiring an examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs  and structures that shape </span><span id="id11360" class="s10">behaviour, and of the dynamics of social movements and education at the local community, regional and  global  levels.  Labelling  the  carbon  included  in  products,  for  example,  could  help  the  decision-making  process  and  increase  awareness  and  knowledge.  Individual  action  suggests  aggregated  but uncoordinated  actions  taken  by  individuals,  whereas  collective  sustainability  actions  involve coordination, a process of participation and governance that may ensure more efficient, equitable and effective outcomes.

The accumulation of applied knowledge is leading increasingly to the co-design of participatory research with local stakeholders who are investigating and transforming their  own  situations in  line  with  climate  action and  sustainable  development (see e.g., Abson et al. 2017; Fazey et al. 2018; Wiek et al. 2012).  </span></div><div id="id11738"><span id="id11739" class="s102">17.4.1.2 Habits, values and awareness </span><span id="id11741" class="s10">Many of the cases that explore transitions to sustainable development point to engrained habits, values and awareness levels as the most persistent yet least visible barriers to a transition. For example, in the transport sector, individuals can quickly become accustomed to personal vehicles, making it difficult for them to transition to sustainable, low-carbon modes of public transport. Demand for high-carbon transportation may also be locked in, and habits reinforced, if low-cost housing (for instance) is not sufficiently  served  by  more  sustainable  (i.e.  mass  transit,  safe  cycling  and  walking  infrastructure) transportation options (Mattioli et al. 2020). </span></div><div id="id11749"><span id="id11750" class="s10">This  is  made  all  the  more  challenging  because  car-</span><span id="id11751" class="s10">manufacturing  &#8220;incumbents&#8221;  utilize  </span><span id="id11752" class="s10">information </span><span id="id11754" class="s10">campaigns directed at the public, pursue lobbying and consulting with policy-makers, and set technical standards that privilege the status quo and prevent the entry of more sustainable innovations (Smink et al. 2015; Turnheim and Nykvist 2019).

For instance,  in  Delhi,  India,  attempts  to  introduce  ostensibly  more  sustainable  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT) systems failed in part due to an arguably top-down approach that had limited public support. It may nonetheless be difficult to win public support (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018), and even grassroots initiatives may themselves be contested and dynamic, making it difficult to generate the collective push to drive a bottom-up transition forward (Hakansson 2018).  </span></div><div id="id11769"><span id="id11770" class="s10">However, dominant, top-down approaches and local, grassroots "alternative" approaches and values do overlap and interact.

Sustainable entrepreneurs  (SEs),  for  instance,  are  described  as  those  who  participate  in  the  development  of  an innovation while simultaneously being rooted in the incumbent energy-intensive system. SE actors who have developed longer term relationships, both formal and informal, with the public authorities can have considerable influence on developing novel renewable-energy technologies (Gasbarro et al. 2017). Institutions and policies that nurture the activities of sustainable entrepreneurs, in particular small- and medium-sized  enterprises  (Burch  et  al.  2016),  can  facilitate  and  strengthen  transitions  toward  more sustainable  development  pathways,  as  can  more  fundamental  adjustments  to  underlying  business models, rather than relying only on incremental adjustments in the efficiency with which resources are used (Burch and Di Bella 2021).  </span></div><div id="id11943"><span id="id11944" class="s10">The creation and growth of sustainable energy and clean-tech clusters enable economic development and transformation on regional scales. Such clusters can put pressure on incumbent technologies and rules to accelerate energy transitions. Successful clusters are nurtured by multi-institutional and multi-stakeholder  actors  building  institutional  support  networks,  facilitating  collaboration  between  sectors and actors, and promoting learning and social change. Notably, regional economic clusters generate a buzz,  which  can  have  a  strong  influence  on  public  acceptance,  support  and  enthusiasm  for sociotechnical transitions (McCauley and Stephens 2012).  </span></div><div id="id11952"><span id="id11953" class="s10">In Norway, many incumbent energy firms have already expanded their operations into the alternative energy sector as both producers and suppliers (who often follow the lead of producers). Producers are responding to perceptions of larger-scale changes in the energy landscape (e.g., the green shift), along with  uncertainties  in  their  own  sectors,  and  innovation  can  spill  across  actors  in  multiple  sectors  (Koasidis et al. 2020). While these firms are expanding out of self-interest, the expansion provides more legitimacy  to  new  forms  of  technology  and  enables  transfers  of  knowledge  and  resources  to  be introduced within this developing niche (Steen and Weaver 2017). Many large, well-established firms are  pursuing  sustainability agendas  and  opting  for transparency  with  regard  to  their  greenhouse gas emissions (Guenther et al. 2016; Kolk et al. 2008), supply chain management (Formentini and Taticchi 2016) and sustainable technology or service development (Dangelico et al. 2016).  </span></div><div id="id11964"><span id="id11965" class="s10">Experiments with the transition open up pathways that can lead to energy transitions on broader scales.

One of the root causes of the failure of traditional financial systems is the undervaluation of natural capital and unsettled property right issues that  are  associated  with  it.  The  exclusion  of  proper  rents  for  scarcities  or  for  global  and  local externalities, including climate change, can undermine larger-scale changes to energy systems (Clark et al. 2018). But even smaller-scale low-carbon energy and infrastructure projects can fail to get off the ground if uncertainty and investment risk discourage project planning and bank-lending programmes (Bolton et al. 2016). The EU's previous actions regarding the "shareholder maximisation norm" and non-binding measures have created path dependencies, limiting  its flexibility in creating sustainable financial legislation. However, the Sustainable Finance Initiative and the Single Market may prove to be "policy hotspots" in encouraging sustainable finance  (Ahlstr&#246;m 2019).Taking advantage of these hotspots may be crucial in overcoming path dependencies and setting new ones in motion.  </span></div><div id="id12143"><span id="id12144" class="s10">One possible positive turn in this regard is the acceleration in investing in the environment (impact and ESG) globally: for instance, there is evidence that some institutional investors are divesting from coal, potentially  auguring  well  for  the  future  (Richardson  2017).

Such institutions and governance arrangements are frequently required to formulate and implement the multi-sectoral policies that spur the adoption and scaling of innovative solutions to climate change and other sustainable development challenges. For example, such institutional and governance conditions have helped support the industrial policies that will be  needed to spread renewables through the creation of domestic supply chains  (Zenghelis 2020) or to pilot CDR methods (Quarton and Samsatli 2020).  </span></div><div id="id12170"><span id="id12171" class="s10">However, government agencies with climate and other remits do not always work well together: the absence of coordination and consensus building mechanisms can further deepen inter-agency conflicts that  stall  a transition.  These  challenges  appear  not  only  within  but  also  between  levels  of  decision-making. Studies of developing megacities, for instance, have found the lack of mechanisms promoting vertical cross-level integration to be a sizable constraint on decarbonisation (Canitez 2019).

For example, decentralized renewable energy has made progress in Argentina, but consumer electricity subsidies give agencies and firms supporting conventional energy an advantage over  those  promoting  renewable  energy.  Similarly,  the  lack  of  concrete  guidance  in  green  finance policies can deprive government agencies and other stakeholders of the information needed to balance ecological  and  financial  goals  (Wang  and  Zhi  2016).  Many  of  these  challenges  can  be  particularly formidable in developing countries, where agencies lack sufficient financial and other capacities. A lack of  government  funds  to  cover  ongoing  maintenance  costs  along  with  resource  shortages  in  rural locations can pose constraints on sustainable energy (Schaube et al. 2018).  </span></div><div id="id12190"><span id="id12191" class="s10">Building  inter-agency  or  multiple  stakeholders  is  frequently  challenging  because  of  the  mutually reinforcing interactions between institutions and ideas.

Capacity-  and  coalition-building,  particularly  among  sub-national  and  non-state  actors  (e.g.  non-governmental  organizations)  is  a  particularly  important  enabler  of  greater coherence  (Bernstein  and Hoffmann 2018). The nexus approach, a systems-based methodology that focuses attention on the many ways in which natural resources are deeply interwoven and mutually interdependent, can strengthen coordination and help to avoid maladaptive pathways (Cremades et al. 2016).  </span></div><div id="id12748"><span id="id12749" class="s10">A  major  shift  is  required  in  the  decision-making  process  in  the  direction  of  taking  a  holistic  view, developing  institutional  mechanisms  to  coordinate  the  actions  of  diverse  actors  and  strengthening complementarities and synergies  (Nikas et al. 2020; Rasul 2016). Currently, nexus approaches have moved from purely conceptual arguments to application and implementation. (Liu et al. 2018) suggest the  need  for  a  systematic  procedure  and  provide  perspectives  on  future  directions.  These  include expanding nexus frameworks that take into account interaction linkages with the SDGs, incorporating overlooked  drivers  and regions,  diversifying  nexus toolboxes  and making these strategies  central  to policy-making and governance in integrating and implementing the SDGs. </span></div><div id="id12758"><span id="id12759" class="s10">In  respect  of  processes,  (Seyfang  and  Haxeltine  2012)  found  a  lack  of  realistic  and  achievable expectations among both members (internally) and the wider public (externally), which hampers the acceleration of transitions. This movement could concentrate strategically on developing and promoting short-term steps towards shared long-term visions, including clearly identifiable goals and end-points. Sustainability science must link research on problem structures with a solutions-oriented approach that seeks  to  understand,  conceptualize  and  foster  experiments  in  how  socio-technical  innovations  for sustainability develop, are diffused and are scaled up (Miller et al. 2014).  </span></div><div id="id12767"><span id="id12768" class="s10">Various strategies and processes have been explored that might facilitate the translation of barriers into enablers, thus accelerating transitions to sustainable development.

Given the political infeasibility of stable, long-term climate policies, the better choice may be to embrace uncertainty in specific policies but entrench the low-carbon transition as the overarching goal.

In jurisdictions where climate and energy policy have been integrated and harmonized, such as the UK, progress has been made in transitioning to sustainable energy (Warren et al. 2016).  </span></div><div id="id12789"><span id="id12790" class="s10">Developing countries that are rich in fossil fuels now have an opportunity to reset their development </span><span id="id12792" class="s10">trajectories by focusing on those opportunities that will offer resilient development in land-use change, low-carbon  energy  generation  and  not  least  more  efficient  resource-planning  (UN-  UNDRR  2019).

As such, many of the claims reviewed involve not only increasing the  speed  of  the  transition  but  also  ensuring  that  it  is  just,  equitable  and  delivers  a  wider  range  of environmental and social benefits. A sustainability transition requires removing the underlying drivers of  vulnerability  and  high  emissions  (quality  and  depth)  while  aligning  the  interests  of  different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth).  </span></div><div id="id12903"><span id="id12904" class="s10">Interest in a sustainability transition has grown steadily over the history of the IPCC and of climate and related policy processes. That interest hit a high point in 2015 with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs. It has continued to remain high as countries have issued NDCs on climate change, VNRs on the SDGs and, in some instances, integrated climate and SDG plans (or similarly themed integrated actions, e.g. circular economy plans). Interest has also gained momentum as local governments, businesses and other stakeholders have followed suit with climate change- or SDG-related plans.  </span></div><div id="id12912"><span id="id12913" class="s10">Implementing many of the recent pledges, however, has proved challenging.

These factors can lock in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering the  momentum  needed  for  large-scale  transformations  of  socioeconomic  systems.  Another consideration is that transition pathways are likely to vary across and within countries due to different development levels, starting points, differential vulnerabilities, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and other contextual factors.  </span></div><div id="id12923"><span id="id12924" class="s10">Even with this diversity, prominent lines of economic, institutional, psychological and systems thinking have reflected  on  interventions  that can  enable  transitions.

For instance, economic arguments often point to the need for targeted regulation or investments, institutional claims centre on multilevel governance reforms, and psychology encourages participation to change mind sets and social norms. Systems-level perspectives offer a useful frame for bringing together these views, but may not capture the richness and details of </span></div><div id="id13006"></div><div id="id13127"><span id="id13128" class="s10">them treated separately. Greater inter- and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the more focused interventions and show how they work together in a system. Such research will be particularly important for working on the concern running through these studies: strengthening synergies between climate and the broader sustainable development agenda.  </span></div><div id="id13133"><span id="id13134" class="s10">National  and  sub-national,  sectoral  and  cross-sectoral,  short-  and  long-term  transition  studies  have assessed the links between sustainable development and mitigation policies and synergies and the trade-offs between the different policy domains. Some general conclusions can be drawn on synergies and trade-offs,  despite  the  actual  impacts  of  policy  implementation  depending  on scale,  context  and  the development starting point.  </span></div><div id="id13140"><span id="id13141" class="s10">From a cross-sectoral perspective, it can be concluded that the AFOLU sector offers many low-cost mitigation options with synergetic SDG impacts, which, however, can also create trade-offs between land-use for food, energy, forest and biodiversity. Some options can help to mitigate such trade-offs, like  agricultural  practices,  forest  conservation  and  soil  carbon  sequestration.  Lifestyle  changes, including  dietary  changes  and  reduced  food  waste,  could  jointly  support  the  SDGs  and  mitigation. Industry  also  offers  several  mitigation  options  with  SDG  synergies,  for  example,  related  to  energy efficiency and the circular economy. Some of the renewable-energy options in industry could indicate some trade-offs in relation to land use, with implications for food- and water security and costs. Cities provide  a  promising  basis  for  implementing  mitigation  with  SDG  synergies,  particularly  if  urban </span><span id="id13151" class="s10">planning, transportation, infrastructure and settlements are coordinated jointly. Similarly, studies of the </span><span id="id13153" class="s10">building sector have identified many synergies between the SDGs and mitigation, but there are issues related to the costs of new technologies. Also, in relation to households and buildings, important equity issues emerge due to the ability of low-income groups to afford the introduction of new technologies. Altogether  these cross-sectoral conclusions  create  a  need  for  policies  to  address  both  synergies and trade-offs, as well as for coordination between different sectoral domains. Context-specific assessments of  synergies  and  trade-offs  are  here  important,  as  is  sharing  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with mitigation policies.  </span></div><div id="id13161"><span id="id13162" class="s10">Several opportunities for creating SDG synergies and avoiding trade-offs have also been identified in relation to integrated adaptation and mitigation policies. The AFOLU sector has a large potential for integrating adaptation and mitigation policies related to agriculture, bioenergy crops, forestry and water use. As was concluded for mitigation options, integrated adaptation and mitigation policies also entail the  risks  of  creating  trade-offs  in  relation  to  food,  water,  energy  access  and  biodiversity.  There  are several  potentially  strong  links  between  climate-change  adaptation  in  industry  and  climate-change adaptation more generally. Various supply chains can be affected by climate change, and mitigation options  related  to  energy  and  water  supply  can  be  disrupted  by  climate  events,  implying  that  great benefits  may  come  from  integrating  adaptation  in  industrial  planning  efforts.  Adaptation  options  in industry can imply increasing the demand for packaging materials such as plastics and for access to refrigeration,  which  are  also  major  sources  of  GHG  emissions,  which  then  would  require  further mitigation options. Mitigation and the co-benefits of adaptation in urban areas in relation to air quality, </span><span id="id13175" class="s10">health, green jobs and equality issues can in most cases to be synergetic and can also support the SDGs. One  exception  are  compact  cities,  with  their  trade-offs  between  mitigation  and  adaptation  because decreasing  urban  sprawl  can  increase  the  risks  of  flooding  and  heat  stress.  Detailed  mapping  of mitigation and adaptation in urban areas shows that there are many, very close interactions between the two policy domains and that coordinated governance across sectors is therefore called for. </span></div><div id="id13181"><span id="id13182" class="s10">Meeting the ambitions of the Paris Agreement will require phasing out fossil fuels from energy systems, which is technically possible and is estimated to be relatively low in cost. However, studies also show that  replacing  fossil  fuels  with  renewables  can  have  major  synergies  and  trade-offs  with  a  broader agenda of sustainable development if a balance is established in relation to land use, food security and </span><span id="id13187" class="s10">job creation (McCollum et al. 2018). Furthermore, the transition to low-emission pathways will require policy  efforts  that  also  address  the  emissions  locked  into  existing  infrastructure,  like  power  plants, factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure already in use: for example, today coal-fired power plants account for 30% of all energy-related emissions. Thus, even though the transition away from fossil fuels </span></div><div id="id13202"></div><div id="id13318"><span id="id13319" class="s10">is  desirable  and  technically  feasible,  it  is  still  largely  constrained  by  existing  fossil  fuel-based infrastructure  and  the  existence  of  </span><span id="id13321" class="s10">stranded  investments.

This phenomenon is rapidly becoming a global reality as social norms change and the pressure to reduce emissions  mounts.

A rising debt burden already hamstrings many.  Decisions on how to spend the remaining carbon budget and who has the right to decide on what to do with existing fossil fuels reflect the complexity of the transition and its non-linearity character.

Viewing climate change through the lens of justice requires a focus on the protection of vulnerable populations from the impacts of climate change, addressing the unequal distribution of the costs and consequences of the transitions themselves, including for those whose livelihoods are rooted in fossil fuel-based  sectors,  and  developing  more  creative  and  participatory  processes  for  envisioning  an equitable decarbonized world. Neglecting issues of justice will have implications for the pace, scale and quality of the transition. </span></div><div id="id13366"><span id="id13367" class="s10">Ultimately, the evidence demonstrates that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing transitions. A constellation of elements come into play, including technological innovations, shifts in markets, social and behavioural dynamics, and governance arrangements. Indeed, transitions require an </span><span id="id13371" class="s10">examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs and the structures that shape behaviour, as well as the dynamics of social movements and education at multiple levels. Likewise, technological and social innovation both play an important role in enabling transitions, highlighting the importance of multi-institutional  and  multi-stakeholder  actors  building  institutional  support  networks,  facilitating collaboration between sectors and actors, and promoting learning and social change. Financial tools and economic  instruments  are  crucial  enablers,  since  many  forms  of  transformational  change  to  energy systems  are  not  possible  when  financial  systems  still  privilege  investing  in  unsustainable,  carbon-intensive sectors.
