  Executive summary Assessment of the social science literature and regional case studies reveals how social norms, culture, and individual choices, interact with infrastructure and other structural changes over time. This provides new insight into climate change mitigation strategies, and how economic and social activity might be organised  across  sectors  to  support  emission  reductions.  To  enhance  well-being,  people  demand services and not primary energy and physical resources per se. Focusing on demand for services and the different social and political roles people play broadens the participation in climate action. Potential of demand-side actions and service provisioning systemsDemand-side mitigation and new ways of providing services can help  avoid, shift, and improve final service demand. Rapid and deep changes in demand make it easier for every sector to reduce GHG emissions in the short and medium term (high confidence). {5.2, 5.3}  The indicative potential of demand-side strategies across all sectors to reduce emissions is 40-70% by 2050 (high confidence). Technical mitigation potentials compared to the IEA WEO, 2020 STEPS baseline amounts up to 5.7 GtCO2eq for building use and construction, 8 GtCO2eq for food demand, 6.5 GtCO2eq for land transport, and 5.2 GtCO2eq for industry.Mitigation strategies can be classified as Avoid-Shift-Improve  (ASI)  options,  that  reflect  opportunities  for  socio-cultural,  infrastructural,  and technological  change.  The  greatest  Avoid  potential  comes  from  reducing  long-haul  aviation  and providing short-distance low-carbon urban infrastructures. The greatest Shift potential would come from switching to plant-based diets. The greatest Improve potential comes from within the building sector, and in particular increased use of energy efficient end-use technologies and passive housing. {5.3.1, 5.3.2, Figure 5.7, Figure 5.8, Table 5.1, Table SM.2} Socio-cultural  and  lifestyle  changes  can  accelerate  climate  change  mitigation  (medium confidence).  Among  60  identified  actions  that  could  change  individual  consumption,  individual mobility choices have the largest potential to reduce carbon footprints.Prioritizingcar-free mobility by walking and cycling and adoption of electric mobility could save 2 tCO2eq cap-1 yr-1. Other options with high mitigation potential include reducing air travel, cooling setpoint adjustments, reduced appliance use, shifts to public transit, and shifting consumption towards plant-based diets. {5.3.1, 5.3.1.2, Figure 5.8} Leveraging  improvements  in  end-use  service  delivery  through  behavioural  and  technological innovations,  and  innovations  in  market  organisation,  leads  to  large  reductions  in  upstream resource use(high confidence). Analysis of indicative potentials range from a factor 10 to 20 fold improvement in the case of available energy (exergy) analysis, with the highest improvement potentials at the end-user and service-provisioning levels. Realisable service level efficiency improvements could reduce upstream energy demand by 45% in 2050. {5.3.2, Figure 5.10} 5-3  Total pages: 192Page 5
  Social aspects of demand-side mitigation actionsDecent living standards (DLS) and well-being for all are achievable through the implementation of high-efficiency low demand mitigation pathways (medium confidence). Decent Living Standards (DLS) – a benchmark of material conditions for human well-being – overlaps with many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Minimum requirements of energy use consistent with enabling well-being for all is between 20 and 50 GJ cap-1 yr-1 depending on the context. {5.2.2.1, 5.2.2.2, Box 5.3} Providing better services with less energy and resource input has high technical potential and is consistent with providing well-being for all (medium confidence). Assessment of 19 demand-side mitigation options and 18 different constituents of well-being show that positive impacts on well-being outweigh negative ones by a factor of 11. {5.2, 5.2.3, Figure 5.6,} Demand-side  mitigation  options  bring  multiple  interacting  benefits(high  confidence).  Energy services to meet human needs for nutrition, shelter, health, etc. are met in many different ways with different  emissions  implications  that  depend  on  local  contexts,  cultures,  geography,  available technologies,  social  preferences.  In  the  near  term,  many  less-developed  countries  and  poor  people everywhere  require  better  access  to  safe  and  low-emissions  energy  sources  to  ensure  decent  living standards and increase energy savings from service improvements by about 20-25%. {5.2, 5.4.5, Figure 5.3, Figure 5.4, Figure 5.5, Figure 5.6, Box 5.2, Box 5.3} Granular technologies and decentralized energy end-use, characterised by modularity, small unit sizes and small unit costs, diffuse faster into markets and are associated with  faster technological learning  benefits,  greater  efficiency,  more  opportunities  to  escape  technological  lock-in,  and greater employment (high confidence). Examples include solar photovoltaic systems, batteries, and thermal heat pumps.{5.3, 5.5, 5.5.3}   Wealthy individuals contribute disproportionately to higher emissions and have a high potential for  emissions  reductions  while  maintaining  decent  living  standards  and  well-being  (high confidence). Individuals with high socio-economic status are capable of reducing their GHG emissions by becoming role models of low-carbon lifestyles, investing in low-carbon businesses, and advocating for stringent climate policies. {5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, Figure 5.14} Demand-side  solutions  require  both  motivation  and  capacity  for  change  (high  confidence). Motivation  by  individuals  or  households  worldwide  to  change  energy  consumption  behaviour  is generally  low.  Individual  behavioural  change  is  insufficient  for  climate  change  mitigation  unless embedded  in  structural  and  cultural  change.  Different  factors  influence  individual  motivation  and capacity for change in different demographics and geographies. These factors go beyond traditional socio-demographic and economic predictors and include psychological variables such as awareness, perceived  risk,  subjective and  social  norms,  values, and  perceived  behavioural control.  Behavioural nudges promote easy behaviour change, e.g., “improve” actions such as making investments in energy efficiency, but fail to motivate harder lifestyle changes. (high confidence) {5.4} FOOTNOTE  1  The  way  choices  are  presented  to  consumers  is  known  as  ‘choice  architecture’  in  the  field  of behavioural economics. 5-4  Total pages: 192Page 6
  consumption  and  GHG  emissions.Green  defaults,  such  as  automatic  enrolment  in  “green  energy” provision, are highly effective. Judicious labelling, framing,and communication of social norms can also increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes. {5.4, 5.4.1, Table 5.3a, Table 5.3b} Coordinated change in several domains leads to the emergence of new low-carbon configurations with cascading mitigation effects (high confidence).Demand-side transitions involve interacting and sometimes  antagonistic  processes  on  the  behavioural,  socio-cultural,  institutional,  business,  and technological dimensions. Individual or sectoral level change may be stymied by reinforcing social, infrastructural,  and  cultural  lock-ins.  Coordinating  the  way  choices  are  presented  to  end  users  and planners,  physical  infrastructures,  new  technologies  and  related  business  models  can  rapidly  realise system-level change. {5.4.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.4.5, 5.5} Cultural change, in combination with new or adapted infrastructure, is necessary to enable and realise many Avoid and Shift options (medium confidence). By drawing support from diverse actors, narratives  of  change  can  enable  coalitions  to  form,  providing  the  basis  for  social  movements  to campaign in favour of (or against) societal transformations. People act and contribute to climate change mitigation in their diverse capacities as consumers, citizens, professionals, role models, investors, and policymakers. {5.4, 5.5, 5.6} Collective  action  as  part  of  social  or  lifestyle  movements  underpins  system  change  (high confidence). Collective action and social organising are crucial to shift the possibility space of public policy on climate change mitigation. For example, climate strikes have given voice to youth in more than  180  countries.  In  other  instances,  mitigation  policies  allow  the  active  participation  of  all stakeholders, resulting in building social trust, new coalitions, legitimising change, and thus initiate a positive cycle in climate governance capacity and policies. {5.4.2, Figure 5.14} Transition  pathways  and  changes  in  social  norms  often  start  with  pilot  experiments  led  by dedicated individuals and niche groups (high confidence).  Collectively, such initiatives can find entry points to prompt policy, infrastructure, and policy reconfigurations, supporting the further uptake of technological and lifestyle innovations. Individuals’ agency is central as social change agents and narrators of meaning. These bottom-up socio-cultural forces catalyse a supportive policy environment, which enables changes. {5.5.2} Social  influencers  and  thought  leaders  can  increase  the  adoption  of  low-carbon  technologies, behaviours, and lifestyles (high confidence). Preferences are malleable and can align with a cultural 5-5  Total pages: 192Page 7
  shift. The modelling of such shifts by salient and respected community members can help bring about changes in different service provisioning systems. Between 10% and 30% of committed individuals are required to set new social norms. {5.2.1, 5.4}  Preconditions and instruments to enable demand-side transformation Social  equity  reinforces  capacity  and  motivation  for  mitigating  climate  change  (medium confidence). Impartial governance such as fair treatment by law and order institutions, fair treatment by gender, and income equity, increases social trust, thus enabling demand-side climate policies. High status  (often  high  carbon)  item  consumption  may  be  reduced  by  taxing  absolute  wealth  without compromising well-being. {5.2, 5.4.2, 5.6} Policies that increase the political access and participation of women, racialized, and marginalised groups,  increase  the  democratic  impetus  for  climate  action.  (high  confidence).  Including  more differently  situated  knowledge  and  diverse  perspectives  makes  climate  mitigation  policies  more effective. {5.2, 5.6} Carbon  pricing  is  most  effective  if  revenues  are  redistributed  or  used  impartially  (high confidence).  A  carbon  levy  earmarked  for  green  infrastructures  or  saliently  returned  to  taxpayers corresponding  to  widely  accepted  notions  of  fairness  increases  the  political  acceptability  of  carbon pricing. {5.6, Box 5.11}  Greater contextualisation and granularity in policy approaches better addresses the challenges of rapid transitions towards zero-carbon systems (high confidence). Larger systems take more time to evolve, grow, and change compared to smaller ones. Creating and scaling up entirely new systems takes longer than replacing existing technologies and practices.Late adopters tend to adopt faster than early pioneers. Obstacles and feasibility barriers are high in the early transition phases. Barriers decrease as  a  result  of  technical  and  social  learning  processes,  network  building,  scale  economies,  cultural debates, and institutional adjustments. {5.5, 5.6} Changes in consumption choices that are supported by structural changes and political action enable  the  uptake  of  low-carbon  choices  (high  confidence).  Policy  instruments  applied  in coordination  can  help  to  accelerate  change  in  a  consistent  desired  direction.  Targeted  technological change,  regulation,  and  public  policy  can  help  in  steering  digitalization,  the  sharing  economy,  and circular economy towards climate change mitigation. {5.3, 5.6} 5-6  Total pages: 192Page 8
  Complementarity in policies helps in the design of an optimal demand-side policy mix (medium confidence). In the case of energy efficiency, for example, this may involve CO2 pricing, standards and norms, and information feedback.{5.3, 5.4, 5.6} 5-7  Total pages: 192Page 9
  5.1Introduction  The  Sixth  Assessment  Report  of  the  IPCC  (AR6),  for  the  first  time,  features  a  chapter  on  demand, services, and social aspects of mitigation. It builds on the AR4, which linked behaviour and lifestyle change to mitigating climate change (IPCC 2007; Roy and Pal 2009; IPCC 2014a), the Global Energy Assessment (Roy et al. 2012), and the AR5, which identified sectoral demand-side mitigation options across chapters (IPCC 2014b; Creutzig et al. 2016b; IPCC 2014a). The literature on the nature, scale, implementation and implications of demand-side solutions, and associated changes in lifestyles, social norms,  and  well-being,  has  been  growing  rapidly  (Creutzig  et  al.  2021a)  (Box  5.2).  Demand-side solutions support near-term climate change mitigation  (Méjean et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019) and include consumers’ technology choices, behaviours, lifestyle changes, coupled production-consumption infrastructures and systems, service provision strategies, and associated socio-technical transitions. This chapter’s assessment of the social sciences (also see Supplementary Materials I Chapter 5) reveals that social dynamics at different levels offer diverse entry points for acting on and mitigating climate change (Jorgenson et al. 2018).  Three entry points are relevant for this chapter. First, well-designed demand for services scenarios are consistent with adequate levels of well-being for everyone (Rao and Baer 2012; Grubler et al. 2018; Mastrucci et al. 2020; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), with high and/or improved quality of life (Max-Neef 1995), improved levels of happiness (Easterlin et al. 2010)  and sustainable human development (Arrow et al. 2013; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017).   Second, demand-side solutions support staying within planetary boundaries (Haberl et al. 2014; Matson et  al.  2016;  Hillebrand et al.  2018;  Andersen  and  Quinn  2020;  UNDESA  2020;  Hickel  et  al.  2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021): they entail fewer environmental risks than many supply side technologies (Von Stechow et al. 2016) and make carbon dioxide removal technologies, such as Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) less relevant (Van Vuuren et al. 2018) or possibly irrelevant in modelling  studies  (Grubler  et  al.  2018;  Hickel  et  al. 2021;  Keyßer and  Lenzen 2021)  still  requiring ecosystem based carbon dioxide removal. In the IPCC’s SR1.5C (IPCC 2018), four stylised scenarios have explored possible pathways towards stabilising global warming at 1.5°C  (SPM SR.15 Figure 3a (IPCC  2014a),  (Figure  5.1)  One  of  these  scenarios, LED-19,  investigates  the  scope  of  demand-side solutions  (Figure 5.1). The comparison of scenarios reveals that such low-energy demand pathways eliminate the need for technologies with high uncertainty, such as BECCS. The requisites for well-being include collective and social interactions as well as consumption-based material inputs. Moreover, rather than material inputs  per se,  people need and demand services for dignified survival, sustenance, mobility, communication, comfort and material well-being (Nakićenović et al. 1996b; Johansson et al. 2012; Creutzig et al. 2018).  These services may be provided in many different context-specific ways using physical resources (biomass, energy, materials, etc.) and available technologies  (e.g.  cooking  tools,  appliances).    Here  we  understand  demand  as  demand  for  services 5-8  Total pages: 192Page 10
  (often requiring material input), with particular focus on services that are required for well-being (such as  lighting,  accessibility,  shelter,  etc.),  and  that  are  shaped  by  culturally  and  geographically differentiated social aspects, choice architectures and the built environment (infrastructures).  Focusing on demand for services broadens the climate solution space beyond technological switches confined to the supply side, to include solutions that maintain or improve well-being related to nutrition, shelter and mobility while (sometimes radically) reducing energy and material input levels (Creutzig et al. 2018; Cervantes Barron 2020; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021; Kikstra et al. 2021b). This also recognises that  mitigation  policies  are  politically,  economically  and  socially  more  feasible,  as  well  as  more effective, when there is a two-way alignment between climate action and well-being (OECD 2019a). There is medium evidenceandhigh agreement that well-designed demand for services scenarios are consistent with adequate levels of well-being for everyone (Rao and Baer 2012; Grubler et al. 2018; Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Kikstra et al. 2021b), with high and/or improved quality of life (Max-Neef 1995; Vogel et al. 2021) and improved levels of happiness (Easterlin et al. 2010)  and sustainable  human  development  (Gadrey  and  Jany-Catrice  2006;  Arrow  et  al.  2013;  Dasgupta  and Dasgupta  2017).  While  demand  for  services  is  high  as  development  levels  increase,  and  related emissions are growing in many countries (Yumashev et al. 2020; Bamisile et al. 2021), there is also evidence that provisioning systems delink services provided from emissions (Conte Grand 2016; Patra et  al.  2017;  Kavitha  et  al.  2020).    Various  mitigation  strategies,  often  classified  into  Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) options, effectively reduce primary energy demand and/or material input (Haas et al. 2015; Haberl et al. 2017; Samadi et al. 2017; Hausknost et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2019; Van den Berg et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020). Users’ participation in decisions about how services are provided, not just their technological feasibility, is an important determinant of their effectiveness and sustainability (Whittle et al. 2019; Vanegas Cantarero 2020). 5-9  Total pages: 192Page 11
  designed by urban planners and building and transport professionals, corresponding investments, and a political  culture  supportive  of  mitigation  action.  This  is  particularly  true  for  many  Avoid  and  Shift decisions that are difficult because they encounter psychological barriers of breaking routines, habits and imagining new lifestyles and the social costs of not conforming to society (Kaiser 2006). Simpler Improve decisions like energy efficiency investments on the other hand can be triggered and sustained by traditional policy instruments complemented by behavioural nudges. A key concern about climate change mitigation policies is that they may reduce quality of life. Based on growing literature, in this chapter we adopt the concept of Decent Living Standards (DLS, explained further in relation to other individual and collective well-being measures and concepts in the Social Sciences Primer) as a universal set of service requirements essential for achieving basic human well-being.  DLS  includes  the  dimensions  of  nutrition,  shelter,  living  condition,  clothing,  health  care, education, and mobility (Frye et al. 2018; Rao and Min 2018b).  DLS provides a fair, direct way to understand  the  basic  low-carbon  energy  needs  of  society  and  specifies  the  underlying  material  and energy requirements. This chapter also comprehensively assesses related well-being metrics that result from demand-side action observing overall positive effects (5.3). Similarly, ambitious low-emissions demand-side scenarios suggest that well-being could be maintained or improved while reducing global final energy demand, and some current literature estimates that it is possible to meet Decent Living Standards for all within the 2-degree warming window (Grubler et al. 2018; Burke 2020; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021) (5.4). A key concern here is how to blend new technologies with social change to integrate Improving ways of living, Shifting modalities and Avoiding certain kinds of emissions altogether (5.6). Social  practice  theory  emphasizes  that  material  stocks  and  social  relations  are  key  in  forming  and maintaining habits (Reckwitz 2002; Haberl et al. 2021) . This chapter reflects these insights by assessing the role of infrastructures and social norms in GHG emission intensive or low-carbon lifestyles (5.4). A core operational principle for sustainable development is equitable access to services to provide well-being for all, while minimising resource inputs and environmental and social externalities/trade-offs, underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Princen 2003; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Dasgupta  and  Dasgupta  2017).  Sustainable  development  is  not  possible  without  changes  in consumption  patterns  within  the  widely  recognised  constraints  of  planetary  boundaries,  resource availability, and the need to provide decent living standards for all  (Langhelle 2000; Toth and Szigeti 2016; O’Neill et al. 2018). Inversely, reduced poverty and higher social equity offer opportunities for delinking demand for services from emissions, e.g., via more long-term decision making after having escaped poverty traps and by reduced demand for non-well-being enhancing status consumption (Nabi et al. 2020; Ortega-Ruiz et al. 2020; Parker and Bhatti 2020; Teame and Habte 2020) (5.3). Throughout  this  chapter  we  discuss  how  people  can  realise  various  opportunities  to  reduce  GHG emission-intensive  consumption  (5.2  and  5.3),  and  act  in  various  roles  (5.4),  within  an  enabling environment created by policy instruments and infrastructure that builds on social dynamics (5.6). 5-10  Total pages: 192Page 12
  START BOX 5.1 HERE Box 5.1 Bibliometric foundation of demand-side climate change mitigation A bibliometric overview of the literature found 99,065 academic peer-reviewed papers identified with 34  distinct  search  queries  addressing  relevant  content  of  this  chapter  (Creutzig  et  al.  2021a).  The literature is growing rapidly (15% yr-1) and the literature body assessed in the AR6 period (2014-2020) is twice as large as all literature published before.  A large part of the literature is highly repetitive and/or includes no concepts or little quantitative or qualitative data of relevance to this chapter. For example, a systematic review on economic growth and decoupling  identified  more  than  11,500  papers  treating  this  topic,  but  only  834  of  those,  i.e.  7%, included relevant data (Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). In another systematic review, assessing quantitative estimates of consumption-based solutions (Ivanova et al. 2020), only 0.8% of papers were considered after consistency criteria were enforced. Altogether, we relied on systematic reviews wherever possible. Other important papers were not captured by systematic reviews, but included in this chapter through expert judgement. Based on topical modelling and relevance coding of resulting topics, the full literature body can be mapped into two dimensions, where spatial relationships indicate topical distance  (Box 5.1, Figure 1). The interpretation of topic demonstrates that the literature organises in four clusters of high relevance for demand-side solutions (housing, mobility, food, and policy), whereas other clusters 5-11  Total pages: 192Page 13

  START BOX 5.2 HERE Box 5.2 COVID-19, service provisioning and climate change mitigation There is now high evidence and high agreement that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the political feasibility  of  large-scale  government  actions  to  support  the  services  for  provision  of  public  goods, including climate change policies. Many behavioural changes due to COVID-19 reinforce sufficiency and emphasis on solidarity, economies built around care, livelihood protection, collective action, and basic service provision, linked to reduced emissions. During  the  shutdown,  emissions  declined  relatively  most  in  aviation,  and  absolutely  most  in  car transport (Le Quéré et al. 2020, Sarkis et al. 2020), and there were disproportionally strong reductions in  GHG  emissions  from  coal  (Bertram  et  al.  2021)(Chapter  2).  At  their  peak,  CO2  emissions  in individual countries decreased by 17% in average (Le Quéré et al. 2020). Global energy demand was projected to drop by 5% in 2020, energy-related CO2 emissions by 7%, and energy investment by 18% (IEA 2020a). Covid-19 shock and recovery scenarios project final energy demand reductions of 1–36 EJ yr−1 by 2025 and cumulative CO2 emission reductions of 14–45 GtCO2 by 2030 (Kikstra et al. 2021a). Plastics use and waste generation increased during the pandemic (Klemeš et al. 2020; Prata et al. 2020). Responses to COVID-19 had important connections with energy demand and GHG emissions due to quarantine and travel restrictions (Sovacool et al. 2020a).  Reductions in mobility and economic activity reduced energy use in sectors such as industry and transport, but  increased energy use in the residential sector (Diffenbaugh et al. 2020). COVID-19 induced behavioural changes that may translate into new habits, some beneficial and some harmful for climate change mitigation. New digitally enabled service  accessibility  patterns  (videoconferencing,  telecommuting)  played  an  important  role  in sustaining various service needs while avoiding demand for individual mobility. However, public transit lost customers to cars, personalised two wheelers, walking and cycling, while suburban and rural living gained  popularity,  possibly  with  long-term  consequences.  Reduced  air  travel,  pressures  for  more localised food and manufacturing supply chains (Hobbs 2020; Nandi et al. 2020; Quayson et al. 2020), and governments’ revealed willingness to make large-scale interventions in the economy also reflect sudden shifts in service provisions and GHG emissions, some likely to be lasting (Aldaco et al. 2020; Bilal et al. 2020; Boyer 2020; Norouzi et al. 2020; Prideaux et al. 2020; Hepburn et al. 2020; Sovacool et al. 2020a). If changes in some preference behaviours, e.g. for larger homes and work environments to enable home working and online education, lead to sprawling suburbs or gentrification with linked 5-13  Total pages: 192Page 15
  environmental  consequences,  this  could  translate  into  long-term  implications  for  climate  change (Beaunoyer  et  al.  2020;  Diffenbaugh  et  al.  2020).  Recovering  from  the  pandemic  by  adopting  low energy demand practices – embedded in new travel, work, consumption and production behaviour and patterns– could reduce  carbon  prices for a 1.5°C consistent pathway by 19%,  reduce energy supply investments until 2030 by 1.8  trillion USD, and lessen pressure on the upscaling of low-carbon energy technologies (Kikstra et al. 2021a). END BOX 5.2 HERE 5.2Services, well-being and equity in demand-side mitigation  As  outlined  in  section  5.1,  mitigation,  equity  and  well-being  go  hand  in  hand  to  motivate  actions. Global, regional, and national actions/policies that advance inclusive well-being and build social trust strengthen  governance.  There  is  high  evidence  and  high  agreement  that  demand-side  measures  cut across all sectors, and can bring multiple benefits (Mundaca et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019; Geels 2020; Niamir et al. 2020b; Garvey et al. 2021; Roy et al. 2021).Since effective demand requires affordability,  one  of  the  necessary  conditions  for  acceleration  of  mitigation  through  demand  side measures  is  wide  and  equitable  participation  from  all  sectors  of  society.  Low-cost  low-emissions technologies, supported  by  institutions and government  policies,  can  help meet service  demand  and advance  both  climate  and  well-being  goals  (Steffen  et  al.  2018a;  Khosla  et  al.  2019).  This  section introduces metrics of well-being and their relationship to GHG emissions, and clarifies the concept of service provisioning.  5.2.1Metrics of well-being and their relationship to GHG emissions There  is  high  evidence  and  agreement  in  the  literature  that  human  well-being  and  related  metrics provide  a  societal  perspective  which  is  inclusive,  compatible  with  sustainable  development,  and 5-14  Total pages: 192Page 16
  generates multiple ways to mitigate emissions. Development targeted to basic needs and well-being for all entails less carbon-intensity than GDP-focused growth (Rao et al. 2014; Lamb and Rao 2015).  Current socioeconomic systems are based on high-carbon economic growth and resource use (Steffen et  al.  2018b).  Several  systematic  reviews  confirm  that  economic  growth  is  tightly  coupled  with increasing  CO2  emissions  (Ayres  and  Warr  2005;  Tiba  and  Omri  2017;  Mardani  et  al.  2019; Wiedenhofer et al. 2020) although the level of emissions depends on inequality (Baležentis et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020b), and on geographic and  infrastructural constraints that force consumers to use fossil fuels (Pottier et al. 2021). Different patterns emerge in the causality of the energy-growth nexus; (i) energy  consumption  causes  economic  growth;  (ii)  growth  causes  energy  consumption;  (iii)  bidirectional causality; and (iv) no significant causality (Ozturk 2010). In a systematic review, Mardani et  al.  (Mardani  et  al.  2019)  found  that  in  most  cases  energy  use  and  economic  growth  have  a bidirectional  causal  effect,  indicating  that  as  economic  growth  increases,  further  CO2 emissions  are stimulated at higher levels; in turn, measures designed to lower GHG emissions may reduce economic growth.  However,  energy  substitution  and  efficiency  gains  may  offer  opportunities  to  break  the bidirectional dependency (Komiyama 2014; Brockway et al. 2017; Shuai et al. 2019). Worldwide trends reveal that at best only relative decoupling (resource use grows at a slower pace than GDP) was the norm during the twentieth century (Jackson 2009; Krausmann et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2016; Jackson 2017), while absolute decoupling (when material use declines as GDP grows) is rare, observed only during recessions or periods of low or no economic growth  (Heun and Brockway 2019; Hickel and Kallis 2019; Vadén et al. 2020; Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). Recent trends in OECD countries demonstrate the  potential  for  absolute  decoupling  of  economic  growth  not  only  from  territorial  but  also  from consumption-based  emissions  (Le  Quéré  et  al.  2019),  albeit  at  scales  insufficient  for  mitigation pathways (Vadén et al. 2020) (Chapter 2).  Energy demand and demand for GHG intensive  products increased from 2010 until 2020 across all sectors and categories. 2019 witnessed a reduction in energy demand growth rate to below 1% and 2020 an overall decline in energy demand, with repercussions into energy supply disproportionally affecting coal via merit order effects (Bertram et al. 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). There was a slight but  significant  shift  from  high  carbon  beef  consumption  to  medium  carbon  intensive  poultry consumption.  Final  energy  use  in  buildings  grew  from  118  EJ  in  2010  to  around  128  EJ  in  2019 (increased  about  8%).  The  highest  increase  was  observed  in  non-residential  buildings,  with  a  13% increase against 8% in residential energy demand (IEA 2019a). While electricity accounted for one-third of building energy use in 2019, fossil fuel use also increased at a marginal annual average growth rate of 0.7% since 2010 (IEA 2020a). Energy-related CO2 emissions from buildings have risen in recent years  after  flattening  between  2013  and  2016.  Direct  and  indirect  emissions  from  electricity  and commercial heat used in buildings rose to 10 GtCO2 in 2019, the highest level ever recorded. Several factors have contributed to this rise, including growing energy demand for heating and cooling with rising  air-conditioner  ownership  and  extreme  weather  events.  A  critical  issue  remains  for  how comfortable people feel with temperatures they will be exposed to in the future and this depends on factors such as physical, psychological and behavioral (Singh et al. 2018; Jacobs et al. 2019). Literature now shows high evidence and high agreement around the observation that policies and infrastructure interventions that lead to change in human preferences are more valuable for climate change mitigation. In economics, welfare evaluations are predominantly based on the preference approach. Preferences are typically assumed to be fixed, so that only changes in relative prices will reduce emissions. However, as decarbonisation is a societal transition, individuals’ preferences do shift and this can contribute to climate change mitigation  (Gough 2015). Even if preferences are assumed to change in response to policy, it is nevertheless possible to evaluate policy, and demand-side solutions, by approaches to well-being/welfare  that  are  based  on  deeper  concepts  of  preferences  across  disciplines  (Fleurbaey  and Tadenuma 2014; Dietrich and List 2016; Mattauch and Hepburn 2016; Roy and Pal 2009; Komiyama 5-15  Total pages: 192Page 17
  2014). In cases of past societal transitions, such as smoking reduction, there is evidence that societies guided the processes of shifting preferences, and values changed along with changing relative prices (Nyborg and Rege 2003; Stuber et al. 2008; Brownell and Warner 2009). Further evidence on changing preferences  in  consumption  choices  pertinent  to  decarbonisation  includes  (Grinblatt  et  al.  2008; Weinberger and Goetzke 2010) for mobility; (Erb et al. 2016; Muller et al. 2017; Costa and Johnson 2019) for diets; (Baranzini et al. 2017) for solar panel uptake. If individuals’ preferences and values change during a transition to the low-carbon economy, then this overturns conclusions on what count as adequate or even optimal policy responses to climate change mitigation in economics (Jacobsen et al. 2012; Schumacher 2015; Dasgupta et al. 2016; Daube and Ulph 2016; Ulph and Ulph 2021). In particular, if policy instruments, such as awareness campaigns, infrastructure development or education, can  change  people’s  preferences,  then  policies  or  infrastructure  provision  –  socially  constrained  by deliberative decision making -- which change both relative prices and preferences, are more valuable for  mitigation  than  previously  thought  (Mattauch  et  al.  2016,  2018;  Creutzig  et  al.  2016b).  The provisioning context of human needs is participatory, so transformative mitigation potential arises from social as well as technological change (Lamb and Steinberger 2017). Many dimensions of well-being and ‘basic needs’ are social not individual in character (Schneider 2016), so extending well-being and DLS analysis to emissions also involves understanding individual situations in social contexts. This includes building supports for collective strategies to reduce emissions (Chan et al. 2019), going beyond individual  consumer  choice.  Climate  policies  that  affect  collective  behaviour  fairly  are  the  most acceptable policies across political ideologies (Clayton 2018); thus collective preferences for mitigation are synergistic with evolving policies and norms in governance contexts that reduce risk, ensure social justice and build trust (Atkinson et al. 2017; Cramton et al. 2017; Milkoreit 2017; Tvinnereim et al. 2017; Smith and Reid 2018; Carattini et al. 2019). Because  of  data  limitations,  which  can  make  cross-country  comparisons  difficult,  health-based indicators and in particular life expectancy (Lamb et al. 2014) have sometimes been proposed as quick and practical ways to compare local or national situations, climate impacts, and policy effects (Decancq et al. 2009; Sager 2017; Burstein et al. 2019). A number of different well-being metrics are valuable in emphasising the constituents of what is needed for a decent life in different dimensions (Porter et al. 2017; Smith and Reid 2018; Lamb and Steinberger 2017). The SDGs overlap in many ways with such indicators, and the data needed to assess progress in meeting the SDGs is also useful for quantifying well-being (Gough 2017). For the purposes of this chapter, indicators directly relating GHG emissions to well-being for all are particularly relevant. Well-being can be categorised either as “hedonic” or “eudaimonic”. Hedonic well-being is related to a subjective  state  of  human  motivation,  balancing  pleasure  over  pain,  and  has  gained  influence  in psychology assessing ‘subjective well-being’ such as happiness and minimising pain, assuming that the individual is motivated to enhance personal freedom, self-preservation and enhancement (Sirgy 2012; Ganglmair-Wooliscroft  and  Wooliscroft  2019;  Brand-Correa  and  Steinberger  2017;  Lamb  and Steinberger 2017). Eudaimonic well-being focuses on the individual in the broader context, associating happiness with virtue (Sirgy 2012) allowing for social institutions and political systems and considering their  ability  to  enable  individuals  to  flourish.  Eudaimonic  analysis  supports  numerous  development approaches (Fanning and O’Neill 2019) such as the capabilities (Sen 1985), human needs (Doyal and Gough 1991; Max-Neef et al. 1991) and models of psychosocial well-being (Ryan and Deci 2001). Measures of well-being differ somewhat in developed and developing countries (Sulemana et al. 2016; Ng and Diener 2019); for example, food insecurity, associated everywhere with lower subjective well-being,  is  more  strongly  associated  with  poor  subjective  well-being  in  more-developed  countries (Frongillo  et  al.  2019);  in  wealthier  countries,  the  relationship  between  living  in  rural  areas  is  less strongly  associated  with  negative  well-being  than  in  less-developed  countries  (Requena  2016);  and income  inequality  is  negatively  associated  with  subjective  well-being  in  developed  countries,  but 5-16  Total pages: 192Page 18
  Decent Living Standards (DLS) serves as a socio-economic benchmark as it views human welfare not in relation to consumption but rather in terms of services which together help meet human needs (e.g. nutrition, shelter, health, etc.), recognising that these service needs may be met in many different ways (with  different  emissions  implications)  depending  on  local  contexts,  cultures,  geography,  available technologies, social preferences, and other factors. Therefore, one key way of thinking about providing well-being for all with low carbon emissions centres around prioritising ways of providing services for DLS in a low-carbon way (including choices of needs satisfiers, and how these are provided or made accessible).  They may be supplied to individuals or groups / communities, both through formal markets and/or informally, e.g. by collaborative work, in coordinated ways that are locally-appropriate, designed and implemented in accordance with overlapping local needs.  The most pressing DLS service shortfalls, as shown in Figure 5.2, lie in the areas of nutrition, mobility, and communication.  Gaps in regions such as Africa and the Middle East are accompanied by current levels of service provision in the highly industrialised countries at much higher than DLS levels for the 5-17  Total pages: 192Page 19
 5-18  Total pages: 192There is high evidence and high agreement in the literature that vital dimensions of human well-being correlate with consumption, but only up to a threshold. High potential for mitigation lies in using low-carbon energy for new basic needs satisfaction while cutting emissions of those whose basic needs are already met (Grubler et al. 2018; Rao and Min 2018b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Rao et al. 2019b; Keyßer  and  Lenzen  2021).    Decent  Living  Standards  indicators  serve  as  tools  to  clarify  this  socio-economic benchmark and identify well-being for all compatible mitigation potential. Energy services provisioning opens up avenues of efficiency and possibilities for decoupling energy services demand from primary energy supply, while needs satisfaction leads to the analysis of the factors influencing the energy demand associated with the achievement of well-being (Brand-Correa and Steinberger 2017; Tanikawa et al. 2021). Vital dimensions of well-being correlate with consumption, but only up to a threshold, decent living energy thresholds range ~13–18.4 GJ-1cap-1yr of final energy consumption but the current consumption ranges from under 5 GJ-1cap-1yr to over 200 GJ-1cap-1yr (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), thus a mitigation strategy that protects minimum levels of essential-goods service delivery for DLS, but critically views consumption beyond the point of diminishing returns of needs satisfaction, is able to sustain well-being while generating emissions reductions (Goldemberg et al. 1988; Jackson and  Marks  1999;  Druckman  and  Jackson  2010;  Girod  and  De  Haan  2010;  Vita  et  al.  2019a; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021). Such relational dynamics are relevant both within and between countries, due to variances in income levels, lifestyle choice (see also 5.4.4), geography, resource assets and local contexts. Provisioning for human needs is recognised as participatory and interrelational; transformative mitigation  potential  can  be  found in social  as  well  as  technological  change  (Mazur  and  Rosa  1974; Goldemberg et al. 1985; Hayward and Roy 2019; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; O’Neill et al. 2018; Vita et al. 2019a). More equitable societies which provide DLS for all can devote attention and resources to mitigation (Dubash 2013; Rafaty 2018; Richards 2003; Oswald et al. 2021). For further exploration of these concepts, see the Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I. 5.2.2Inequity in access to basic energy use and services 5.2.2.1Variations in access to needs-satisfiers for Decent Living Standards There is very high evidence and very high agreement that globally, there are differences in the amount of energy that societies require to provide the basic needs for everyone. At present nearly one-third of the world’s population are ‘energy-poor’ facing challenges in both access and affordability, i.e., more than 2.6 billion people have little or no access to energy for clean cooking. About 1.2 billion lack energy for  cleaning, sanitation and water supply, lighting, and basic livelihood tasks (Sovacool and Drupady 2016; Rao and Pachauri 2017).The current per capita energy requirement to provide a decent standard FOOTNOTE 2 The countries and areas classification in this figure deviate from the standard classification scheme adopted by WGIII as set out in Annex II, section 1.  5-19  Total pages: 192Figure 5.3 Energy use per capita of three groups of countries ranked by socioeconomic development and displayed for each country based on four or five different income groups (according the data availability) as well as geographical representation.

Data based on(Oswald et al. 2020).START BOX 5.3 HERE Box 5.3 Inequities in access to and levels of end-use technologies and infrastructure services Acceleration  in  mitigation  action  needs  to  be  understood  from  societal  perspective.  Technologies, access and service equity factors sometimes change rapidly. Access to technologies, infrastructures and products, and the services they provide, are essential for raising global living standards and improving human well-being (Alkire and Santos 2014; Rao and Min 2018b). Yet access to and levels of service delivery are distributed extremely inequitably as of now. How fast such inequities can be reduced by granular end-use technologies is illustrated by the cellphone (households with mobiles), comparing the  situation  between  2014  and  2018.  In  this  eighteen-year  period,  cellphones  changed  from  a  very inequitably-distributed technology to one with almost universal access, bringing accessibility benefits especially to  populations  with  very  low  disposable  income  and  to those  whose  physical mobility  is limited (Porter 2016). Every human has the right to dignified decent life, to live in good health and to participate in society. This is a daunting challenge, requiring that in the next decade governments build out infrastructure to provide billions of people with access to a number of services and basic amenities in comfortable homes, nutritious food, and transit options (Rao and Min 2018b). For long, this challenge was thought to also be an impediment to developing countries’ participation in global climate mitigation efforts. However, recent research shows that this need not be the case (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Rao et al. 2019b). Box 5.3, Figure 1 International inequality in access and use of goods and services.  Upper panel: International Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients accounting for the share of population living in households without access (origin of the curves on the y-axis), multiple ownership not considered. Lower panel: Gini, number of people without access, access rates and coverage in terms of share of global population and number of countries included. *Reduced samples lead to underestimation of inequality. A sample, for example, of around 80% of world population (taking the same 43 countries as Page 24
  for mobiles and cars) led to a lower Gini of around 0.48 (-0.04) for electricity. The reduced sample was kept for mobiles in 2018 to allow for comparability with 2000. Source: (Zimm 2019) Several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN 2015) deal with providing access to technologies and service infrastructures to the share of population so far excluded, showing that the UN 2030 Agenda has adopted a multidimensional perspective on poverty. Multidimensional poverty indices, such as the Social Progress Indicator (SPI) and the Individual Deprivation Measure, go beyond income and focus on tracking the delivery of access to basic services by the poorest population groups, both in developing countries (Fulton et al. 2009; Alkire and Robles 2017; Alkire and Santos 2014; Rao and Min 2018b), and in developed countries (Townsend 1979; Aaberge and Brandolini 2015; Eurostat 2018). At the same time, the SDGs, primarily SDG 10 on reducing inequalities within and among  countries,  promote  a  more  equitable  world,  both  in  terms  of  inter-  as  well  as  intra-national equality.  Access to various end-use technologies and infrastructure services features directly in the SDG targets and  among  the  indicators  used  to  track  their  progress  (UNESC  2017;  UN  2015):  Basic  services  in households  (SDG  1.4.1),  Improved  water  source  (SDG  6.1.1);  Improved  sanitation  (SDG  6.1.2); Electricity (SDG 7.1.1); Internet - fixed broadband subscriptions (SDG 17.6.2); Internet - proportion of population (SDG 17.8.1). Transport (public transit, cars, mopeds or bicycles) and media technologies (mobile  phones,  TVs,  radios,  PCs,  Internet)  can  be  seen  as  proxies  for  access  to  mobility  and communication, crucial for participation in society and the economy (Smith et al. 2015). In addition, SDG  10  is  a  more  conventional income-based inequality  goal,  referring  to  income inequality (SDG 10.1), social, economic and political inclusion of all (SDG 10.2.), and equal opportunities and reduced inequalities of outcome (SDG 10.3). END BOX 5.3 HERE 5.2.2.2Variations in energy use There is high evidence and high agreement in the literature that through equitable distribution, well-being for all can be  assured at the lowest-possible energy consumption levels (Steinberger and Roberts 2010; Oswald et al. 2020) by reducing emissions related to consumption as much as possible, while assuring DLS for everyone (Annecke 2002; de Zoysa 2011; Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2013; Spangenberg 2014; Toroitich and Kerber 2014; Dario Kenner 2015; Smil 2017; Toth and Szigeti 2016; Otto et al. 2019;  Baltruszewicz  et  al.  2021).  For  example,  at  similar  levels  of  human  development,  per  capita energy  demand  in  the  US  was  63%  higher  than  in  Germany  (Arto  et  al.  2016);  those  patterns  are explained by context in terms of various climate, cultural and historical factors influencing consumption Context matter even in within country analysis ,e.g. electricity consumption in US show that efficiency innovations  do  exert  positive  influence  on  savings  of  residential  energy  consumption,  but  the relationship  is  mixed;  on  the  contrary,  affluence  (household  income  and  home  size)  and  context (geographical location)  drives  significantly  resource utilization (Adua and  Clark  2019), affluence is central to any future prospect in terms of environmental conditions (Wiedmann et al. 2020). In China, inequality of energy consumption and expenditure varies highly depending on the energy type, end-use demand and climatic region (Wu et al. 2017).  Consumption  is  energy  and  materials-intensive  and  expands  along  with  income.  About  half  of  the energy used in the world is consumed by the richest 10% of people, most of whom live in developed countries, especially when one includes the energy embodied in the goods they purchase from other countries and the structure of consumption as a function of income level (Wolfram et al. 2016; Arto et al. 2016; Santillán Vera et al. 2021). International trade plays a central tole being responsible for shifting burdens  in  most  cases  from  low-income  developing  countries  producers  to  high  income  developed countries  as  consumers  (Wiedmann  et  al.  2020).  China  is  the  largest  importing  market  for  EU  and United States, which accounts for near half and 40% of their imports in energy use respectively (Wu et Page 25
  al. 2019). Wealthy countries have exported or outsourced their climate and energy crisis to low and middle-income countries (Baker 2018) exacerbated by intensive international trade (Steinberger et al. 2012; Scherer et al. 2018). Therefore, issues of total energy consumption are inseparably related to the energy inequity among the countries and regions of the world.  Within the energy  use  induced  by global consumer products, household  consumption is the  biggest contributor, contributing to around three quarters of the global total (Wu et al. 2019). A more granular analysis  of  household  energy  consumption    reveals  that  the  lowest  two  quintiles  in  countries  with average  annual  income  below  15,000  USD  cap-1  consume less  energy than the international  energy requirements  for  DLS  (20-50  GJ cap-1);  77%  of  people consume less than  30  GJ  cap-1yr-1  and  38% consume less than 10 GJ cap-1yr-1 (Oswald et al. 2020). Many energy-intensive goods have high price elasticity (>1.0), implying that growing incomes lead to over-proportional growth of energy footprints in these consumption categories. Highly unequally distributed energy consumption is concentrated in the transport sector, ranging from vehicle purchase to fuels, and most unequally in package holidays and aviation (Gössling 2019; Oswald et al. 2020).  Socio-economic dynamics and outcomes affect whether provisioning of goods and services is achieved at low energy demand levels (Figure 5.4). Specifically, multivariate regression shows that public service quality, income  equality,  democracy,  and  electricity  access  enable  higher  need satisfaction  at  lower energy demand, whereas extractivism and economic growth beyond moderate levels of affluence are reduce need satisfaction at higher energy demand (Vogel et al. 2021). Altogether this demonstrates that at a given level of energy provided, there is large scope to  improve service levels for well-being by modifying social economic context without increasing energy supply (Figure 5.4).  Page 26
  Figure 5.4 Improving services for well-being is possible, often at huge margin, at a given (relatively low) level of energy use Source:(Vogel et al. 2021) 5.2.2.3Variations in consumption-based emissions The carbon footprint of a nation is equal to the direct emissions occurring due to households’ transport, heating  and  cooking,  as  well  as  the  impact  embodied  in  the  production  of  all  consumed  goods  and services (Wiedmann and Minx 2008; Davis and Caldeira 2010; Hübler 2017; Vita et al. 2019a). There are  large  differences  in  carbon  footprints  between  the  poor  and  the  rich.  As  a  result  of  energy  use inequality, the lowest global emitters (the poorest 10% in developing countries) in 2013 emitted about 0.1t CO2 cap-1, whereas the highest global emitters (the top 1% in the richest countries) emitted about 200-300 tCO2 cap-1 (World Bank 2019), . The poorest 50% of the world’s population are responsible for only about 10% of total lifetime consumption emissions, in contrast  about ~50% of the world’s GHG emissions can be attributed to consumption by the world’s richest 10%, with the average carbon footprint of the richest being 175 times higher than that of the poorest 10% (Chancel and Piketty 2015) consuming the global carbon budget by nearly 30% during the period 1990-2015 (Kartha et al. 2020; Gore  2020).   While  the mitigation  efforts  often  focus  on  the  poorest, the lifestyle  and  consumption patterns of the affluent people often influence the growing middle class (Otto et al. 2019), e.g. Across 5-25  Total pages: 192Page 27
  EU countries, only 5% of households are living within the 1.5% climate limits and the top 1% emit more than 22 times the target on average, being the transport in both land and air a characteristic of the highest emitters (Ivanova and Wood 2020).  In  low-income  nations-which  can  exhibit  per-capita  carbon  footprints  30  times  lower  than  wealthy nations (Hertwich and Peters 2009) emissions are predominantly domestic and driven by provision of essential services (shelter, low-meat diets, clothing). Per capita carbon footprints average 1.6 tonnes per year for the lowest income category, then quickly increase to 4.9 and 9.8 tonne for the two middle-income categories and finally to an average of 17.9 tonnes for the highest income category. Global CO2 emissions remain concentrated: the top 10% of emitters contribute about 35-45% of the total, while the bottom 50%  contribute just  13-15%  of  global  emissions  (Hubacek  et  al.  2017; Chancel  and  Piketty 2015).  In  wealthy  nations,  services  such  as  private  road  transport,  frequent  air  travel,  private  jet ownership,  meat-intensive  diets,  entertainment  and  leisure  add  significant  emissions,  while  a considerable fraction of the carbon footprint is imported from abroad, embedded in goods and services (Hubacek et al. 2017).  High income households consume and demand energy at an order of magnitude greater than what is necessary  for  DLS  (Oswald  et  al.  2020).  Energy-intensive goods,  such  as  package  holidays,  have  a higher  income  elasticity  of  demand  than  less  energy-intensive  goods  like  food,  water  supply  and housing maintenance, which results in high-income individuals having much higher energy footprints (Oswald  et  al.  2020).  Evidence  highlights  highly  unequal  GHG  emission  in  aviation:  only  2-4%  of global population flew internationally in 2018, with 1% of world population emitting 50% of CO2 from commercial aviation (Gössling and Humpe 2020). Some individuals may add more than 1,600 t CO2 yr-1 individually by air travel (Gössling 2019).  The food sector dominates in all income groups, comprising 28% of  households’ carbon footprint, with cattle and rice the major contributors  (Scherer et al. 2018), food also accounts for 48% and 70% of household impacts on land and water resources, being the meat, dairy, and processed food rising fast together with income (Ivanova et al. 2016). Roughly 20-40% of food produced worldwide is lost to waste before it reaches the market, or is wasted by households, the energy embodied in wasted food was estimated at ~36 EJyr-1, and during the period 2010-2016 global food loss and waste equalled 8-10% of total GHG emissions (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Springmann et al. 2018; Mbow et al. 2019). Global agri-food supply chains are crucial in the variation of per capita food consumption-related-GHG footprints, mainly in the case of red meat and dairy (Kim et al. 2020) since highest per capita food-consumption-related  GHG  emissions  do  not  correlate  perfectly  with  the  income  status  of  countries. Thus, it is also crucial to focus on high-emitting individuals and groups within countries, rather than only those who live in high-emitting countries, since the top 10% of emitters live on all continents and one third of them are from the developing world (Chakravarty et al. 2009; Pan et al. 2019). Increasing  incomes  for  all  to  attain  DLS  raises  emissions  and  energy  footprints,  but  only  slightly (Jorgenson et  al.  2016;  Chakravarty et  al.  2009;  Scherer  et  al.  2018; Millward-Hopkins  et  al.  2020; 5-26  Total pages: 192Page 28
  Oswald et al. 2020, 2021).  The amount of energy needed for a high global level of human development is dropping (Steinberger and Roberts 2010) and could by 2050 be reduced to 1950 levels (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020) requiring a massive deployment of technologies across the different sectors as well as  demand-side  reduction  consumption.  The  consumption  share  of  the  bottom  half  of  the  world's population represents less than 20% of all energy footprints, which is less than what the top 5% of people consume (Oswald et al. 2020).  Income inequality itself also raises carbon emissions (Hao et al. 2016; Sinha 2016; Uzar and Eyuboglu 2019; Baloch et al. 2020; Wiedmann et al. 2020; Oswald et al. 2020; Vogel et al. 2021). Wide inequality can increase status-based consumption patterns, where individuals spend more to emulate the standards of the high-income group (the Veblenian effect); inequality also diminishes environmental efforts by reducing social cohesion and cooperation (Jorgenson et al. 2017) and finally, inequality also operates by  inducing  an  increase  in  working  hours  that  leads  to  higher  economic  growth  and,  consequently, higher emissions and ecological footprint, so working time reduction is key for policy to both reduce emissions and protect employment (Fitzgerald et al. 2015, 2018). 5.2.3Equity, trust, and participation in demand-side mitigation There is high evidence and high agreement in literature that socio-economic equity builds not only well-being for all, but also trust and effective participatory governance, which in turn strengthen demand-side climate mitigation.Equity, participation, social trust, well-being, governance and mitigation are parts  of  a  continuous  interactive  and  self-reinforcing  process  (Figure  5.5).  Section  SM5.1  in  the Supplemental Material for this chapter contains more detail on these links, drawing from social science literature.  Economic growth in equitable societies is associated with lower emissions than in inequitable societies (McGee and Greiner 2018), and income inequality is associated with higher global emissions (Ravallion et al. 1997; Rao and Min 2018c; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019; Fremstad and Paul 2019; Liu and Hao 2020;  McGee  and  Greiner  2018).  Relatively  slight  increases  in  energy  consumption  and  carbon emissions produce great increases in human development and well-being in less-developed countries, and the amount of energy needed for a high global level of human development is dropping (Steinberger and Roberts 2010). Equitable & democratic societies which provide high quality public services to their population have high well-being outcomes at lower energy use than those which do not, whereas those which prioritize economic growth beyond moderate incomes and extractive sectors display a reversed effect (Vogel et al. 2021). 5-27  Total pages: 192Page 29
  Figure 5.5 Well-being, equity, trust, governance and climate mitigation: positive feedbacks.  Well-being for all, increasingly seen as the main goal of sustainable economies, reinforces emissions reductions through a network of positive feedbacks linking effective governance, social trust, equity, participation and sufficiency. This diagram depicts relationships noted in this chapter text and explained further in the Social Science Primer (supplementary material I in this Chapter).  The width of the arrows corresponds to the level of confidence and degree of evidence from recent social sciences literature.   Well-designed climate mitigation policies ameliorate constituents of well-being (Creutzig et al. 2021b). The study shows that among all demand-side option effects on well-being 79% are positive, 18% are neutral (or not relevant/specify), and only 3% are negative (high confidence) (Creutzig et al. 2021b) (Figure  5.6).  Figure  5.6  illustrates  active  mobility  (cycling  and  walking),  efficient  buildings  and prosumer  choices  of  renewable  technologies  have  the  most  encompassing  beneficial  effects  on wellbeing with no negative outcome detected. Urban and industry strategies are highly positive overall for wellbeing, but they will also reshape supply-side businesses with transient intermediate negative effects.  Shared  mobility,  like  all  others,  has  overall  highly  beneficial  effects  on  wellbeing,  but  also displays  a  few  negative  consequences,  depending  on  implementation,  such  as  a  minor  decrease  in personal security for patrons of ridesourcing. 5-28  Total pages: 192Page 30
  Policies designed to foster higher well-being for all via climate mitigation include reducing emissions through  wider  participation  in  climate  action,  building  more  effective  governance  for  improved mitigation, and including social trust, greater equity, and informal-sector support as integral parts of climate policies. Public participation facilitates social learning and people’s support of and engagement with  climate  change  priorities;  improved  governance  is  closely  tied  to  effective  climate  policies (Phuong et al. 2017). Better education, health care, valuing of social diversity, and reduced poverty –characteristics  of  more  equal  societies–all  lead  to  resilience,  innovation,  and  readiness  to  adopt progressive and locally-appropriate mitigation policies, whether high-tech or low-tech, centralised or decentralised (Tanner et al. 2009; Lorenz 2013; Chu 2015; Cloutier et al. 2015; Mitchell 2015; Martin and Shaheen 2016; Vandeweerdt et al. 2016; Turnheim et al. 2018). Morover, these factors are the ones identified as enablers of high need satisfaction at lower energy use (Vogel et al. 2021). There is less policy lock-in in more equitable societies (Seto et al. 2016). International communication, networking, and global connections among citizens are more prevalent in more equitable societies, and these help spread promising mitigation approaches (Scheffran et al. 2012). Climate-related injustices are addressed where equity is prioritised (Klinsky and Winkler 2014). Thus, there is high confidence in the literature that addressing inequities in income, wealth, and DLS not only raises overall well-being and furthers the SDGs but also improves the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies. For example,  job  creation,  retraining  for  new  jobs,  local  production  of  livelihood  necessities,  social provisioning, and other positive steps toward climate mitigation and adaptation are all associated with more equitable and resilient societies (Okvat and Zautra 2011; Bentley 2014; Klinsky et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2018a).  At all scales of governance, the popularity and sustainability of climate policies requires attention to the fairness of their health and economic implications for all, and participatory engagement across social groups – a responsible development framing (Cazorla and Toman 2001; Dulal et al. 2009; Chuku 2010; Shonkoff et al. 2011; Navroz 2019; Hofstad and Vedeld 2020; Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Waller et al. 2020; Roy and Schaffartzik 2020; Temper et al. 2020).  Far from being secondary or even a  distraction from climate mitigation  priorities, an  equity focus  is  intertwined  with mitigation goals (Klinsky  et  al.  2016).  Demand-side  climate  mitigation  options  have  pervasive  ancillary,  equity-enhancing  benefits,  e.g.  for  health,  local  livelihoods,  and  community  forest  resources  (Figure  5.6) (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009; Garg 2011; Shaw et al. 2014; Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015; Klausbruckner et al. 2016; Salas and Jha 2019). Limiting climate change risks is fundamental to collective well-being (Max-Neef et al. 1989; Yamin et al. 2005; Nelson et al. 2013; Pecl et al. 2017; Tschakert et al. 2017; Gough 2015, 2017). Section 5.6 discusses well-designed climate policies more fully, with examples. Rapid  changes  in  social  norms  which  are  underway  and  which  underlie  socially-acceptable  climate policy initiatives are discussed in section 5.4. 5-29  Total pages: 192Page 31

Since  no  country  now  meets  its  citizens’  basic  needs  at  a  level  of  resource  use  that  is  globally sustainable, while high levels of life satisfaction for those just escaping extreme poverty require even more resources, the need for transformative shifts in governance and policies is large (O’Neill et al. 2018; Vogel et al. 2021). 5-30  Total pages: 192Page 32

  Inequitable  societies  use  energy  and  resources  less  efficiently.  Higher  income  inequality  is associated with higher carbon emissions, at least in developed countries (Grunewald et al. 2011; Golley and Meng 2012; Chancel et al. 2015; Grunewald et al. 2017; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Sager 2017; Klasen 2018; Liu et al. 2019); reducing inequality in high-income countries helps to reduce emissions (Klasen 2018). There is high agreement in the literature that alienation or distrust weakens collective governance and fragments political approaches towards climate action (Smit and Pilifosova 2001; Adger et al. 2003; Hammar and Jagers 2007; Van Vossole 2012; Bulkeley and Newell 2015; Smith and Howe 2015; ISSC et al. 2016; Smith and Mayer 2018; Fairbrother et al. 2019; Kulin and Johansson Sevä 2019; Liao et al. 2019; Alvaredo et al. 2018; Hayward and Roy 2019).    Populism and politics of fear are less prevalent under conditions of more income equality (Chevigny 2003; Bryson and Rauwolf 2016; O’Connor 2017; Fraune and Knodt 2018; Myrick and Evans Comfort 2019). Ideology and other social factors also play a role in populist climate scepticism, but many of these  also  relate  to  resentment  of  elites  and  desire  for  engagement  (Swyngedouw  2011;  Lockwood 2018; Huber et al. 2020). “Climate populism” movements are driven by an impetus for justice (Beeson 2019; Hilson 2019). When people feel powerless and/or that climate change is too big a problem to solve because others are not acting, they may take less action themselves (Williams and Jaftha 2020). However, systems for benefit-sharing can build trust and address large-scale “commons dilemmas”, in the  context  of  strong  civil  society  (Barnett  2003;  Mearns  and  Norton  2009;  Inderberg  et  al.  2015; Sovacool et al. 2015; Hunsberger et al. 2017; Soliev and Theesfeld 2020).  Leadership is also important in fostering environmentally-responsible group behaviours (Liu and Hao 2020). In some less-developed countries, higher income inequality may in fact be associated with lower per capita emissions, but this is because people who are excluded by poverty from access to fossil fuels must rely on biomass (Klasen 2018). Such energy poverty – the fact that millions of people do not have access to energy sources to help meet human needs – implies the opposite of development (Guruswamy 2010, 2020). In developing countries, livelihood improvements do not necessarily cause increases in emissions(Peters et al. 2012; Reusser et al. 2013; Creutzig et al. 2015a; Chhatre and Agrawal 2009; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021)and poverty alleviation causes negligible emissions(Chakravarty et al. 2009). Greater  equity  is  an  important  step  towards  sustainable  service  provisioning  (Godfray  et  al.  2018; Dorling 2019; Timko 2019).  As  discussed  in  Section  5.6,  policies  to  assist  the  low-carbon  energy  transition  can  be  designed  to include additional benefits for income equality, besides contributing to greater energy access for the poor (Burke and Stephens 2017; Frank 2017; Healy and Barry 2017; Sen 2017; Chapman et al. 2018; La Viña et al. 2018; Chapman and Fraser 2019; Piggot et al. 2019; Sunderland et al. 2020). Global and intergenerational  climate  inequities  impact  people’s  well-being,  which  affects  their  consumption patterns and political actions (Gori-Maia 2013; Clayton et al. 2015; Pizzigati 2018; Albrecht et al. 2007; Fritze et al. 2008) (see Box 5.4).  5-32  Total pages: 192Page 34
  Multi-level or polycentric governance can enhance well-being and improve climate governance  and social  resilience,  due  to  varying  adaptive,  flexible  policy  interventions  at  different  times  and  scales (Kern and Bulkeley 2009; Lidskog and Elander 2009; Amundsen et al. 2010; Keskitalo 2010; Lee and Koski 2015; Jokinen et al. 2016; Lepeley 2017; Marquardt 2017; Di Gregorio et al. 2019). Institutional transformation may also result from socio-ecological stresses that accompany climate change, leading to more effective governance structures (David Tàbara et al. 2018; Patterson and Huitema 2019; Barnes et al.  2020).  An  appropriate,  context-specific mix  of options  facilitated  by  policies  can  deliver  both higher well-being and reduced disparity in access to basic needs for services concurrently withclimate mitigation  (Thomas  and  Twyman  2005;  Klinsky  and  Winkler  2014;  Lamb  et  al.  2014;  Mearns  and Norton  2009;  Lamb  and  Steinberger  2017).  Hence,  nurturing  equitable  human  well-being  through provision of decent living standards for all goes hand in hand with climate change mitigation (ISSC et al. 2016; OECD 2019a).  There is high confidence in the literature that addressing inequities in income, wealth,  and  DLS  not  only  raises  overall  well-being  and  furthers  the  SDGs  but  also  improves  the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies.Participatory  governance  involves  understanding  and  engagement  with  policies,  including climate policies. Greater public participation in climate policy processes and governance, by increasing the  diversity  of  ideas  and  stakeholders,  builds  resilience  and  allows  broader  societal  transformation towards systemic change even in complex, dynamic and contested contexts (Dombrowski 2010; Wise et al. 2014; Haque et al. 2015; Jodoin et al. 2015; Mitchell 2015; Kaiser 2020; Alegria 2021). This sometimes  involves  complex  policy  discussions  that  can  lead  to  governance  innovations,  also influencing  social  norms  (Martinez  2020).  A  specific  example  are  citizen  assemblies,  deliberating public policy challenges, such as climate change (Devaney et al. 2020). Activist climate movements are changing  policies  as  well  as  normative  values  (see  Section  5.4  and  the  Social  Science  Primer). Environmental justice and climate justice activists worldwide have called attention to the links between economic  and  environmental  inequities,  collected  and  publicised  data  about  them,  and  demanded stronger  mitigation  (Goodman  2009;  Schlosberg  and  Collins  2014;  Jafry  et  al.  2019;  Cheon 2020). Youth climate activists, and Indigenous leaders, are also exerting growing political influence towards  mitigation  (Helferty  and  Clarke  2009;  White  2011;  Powless  2012;  Petheram  et  al.  2015; Curnow and Gross 2016; Grady-Benson and Sarathy 2016; Claeys and Delgado Pugley 2017; UN 2015; O’Brien et al. 2018; Rowlands and Gomez Peña 2019; Bergmann and Ossewaarde 2020; Han and Ahn 2020;  Nkrumah  2021). Indigenous  resurgence  (activism  fuelled  by  ongoing  colonial  social  /  environmental  injustices,  land  claims,  and  deep  spiritual/cultural  commitment  to  environmental protection) not only strengthens climate leadership in many countries, but also changes broad social norms by raising knowledge of Indigenous governance systems which supported sustainable lifeways over thousands of years (Wildcat 2014; Chanza and De Wit 2016; Whyte 2018, 2017; Temper et al. 2020). Related trends include recognition of the value of traditional ecological knowledge, Indigenous governance  principles,  decentralisation,  and  appropriate  technologies  (Lange  et  al.  2007;  Goldthau 2014; Whyte 2017). 5-33  Total pages: 192Page 35
  Section 5.6 includes examples of climate mitigation policies and policy packages  which address the interrelationships shown in Figure 5.5. Improving well-being for all through climate mitigation includes emissions-reduction  goals in  policy  packages that  ensure  equitable  outcomes,  prioritize social  trust-building, support wide public participation in climate action including within the informal sector, and facilitate institutional change for effective multi-level governance, as integral components of climate strategies.  This strategic approach, and its feasibility of success, rely on complex contextual factors that  may  differ  widely,  especially  between  Global  North  and  Global  South(Atteridge  et  al.  2012; Patterson et al. 2018; Jewell and Cherp 2020; Singh et al. 2020, 2021).START BOX 5.4 HERE Box 5.4 Gender, race, intersectionality and climate mitigation There  is  high  evidence  and  high  agreement  that  empowering  women  benefits  both  mitigation  and adaptation, because women prioritise climate change in their voting, purchasing, community leadership, and work both professionally and at home (high evidence, high agreement). Increasing voice and agency for  those  marginalised  in  intersectional  ways  by  Indigeneity,  race,  ethnicity,  dis/ability,  and  other factors has positive effects for climate policy (high evidence, high agreement). Climate change affects people differently along all measures of difference and identity, which have intersectional impacts linked to economic vulnerability and marginalisation (Morello Frosch et al. 2009; Dankelman 2010; Habtezion 2013; Godfrey and Torres 2016; Walsh 2016; Flatø et al. 2017; Goodrich et al. 2019; Perkins 2019; Gür 2020).  Worldwide, racialized and Indigenous people bear the brunt of environmental and climate injustices through geographic location in extraction and energy “sacrifice zones”,  areas  most  impacted  by  extreme  weather  events,  and/or  through  inequitable  energy  access (Aubrey 2019; Gonzalez 2020; Lacey-Barnacle et al. 2020; Porter et al. 2020; Temper et al. 2020; Jafry et al. 2019) Disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect pre-existing inequalities, they also reinforce them.  For example, inequities in income and in the ownership and control of household assets,  familial  responsibilities  due  to  male  out-migration,  declining  food  and  water  access,  and increased disaster exposure can undermine women's ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain physical and mental health and well-being (Chandra et al. 2017; Eastin 2018; Das et al. 2019). Studies during the COVID crisis have found that, in general, women’s economic and  productive  lives  have been affected  disproportionately  to  men’s   (Alon et al. 2020;  ILO  2020). Women have less access to social protections and their capacity to absorb economic shocks is very low, so they face a “triple burden” during crises -- including those resulting from climate change -- and this is  heightened  for  women  in  the  less-developed  countries  and  for  those  who  are  intersectionally vulnerable (Coates et al. 2020; McLaren et al. 2020; Wenham et al. 2020; Azong and Kelso 2021; Erwin et al. 2021; Maobe and Atela 2021; Nicoson 2021; Sultana 2021; Versey 2021).   Because men currently hold  the  majority  of  energy-sector  jobs,  energy  transition  will  impact  them  economically  and psychologically;  benefits,  burdens  and  opportunities  on  both  the  demand  and  supply  sides  of  the mitigation transition have a range of equity implications (Pearl-Martinez and Stephens 2017; Standal et al.  2020;  Mang-Benza  2021).  Mitigating  gendered  climate  impacts  requires  addressing  inequitable power relations throughout society(Wester and Lama 2019). Women’s  well-being  and  gender-responsive  climate  policy  have  been  emphasized  in  international agreements  including  the  Paris  accord  (UNFCCC  2015),  CEDAW  General  Recommendation  37 (Vijeyarasa 2021),  and the 2016 Decision 21/CP.22 on Gender and Climate Change (UNFCCC 2016; Larson  et  al.  2018).    Increasing  the  participation  of  women  and  marginalised  social  groups,  and addressing their special needs, helps to meet a range of SDGs, improve disaster and crisis response, increase social trust, and improve climate mitigation policy development and implementation  (Alber 5-34  Total pages: 192Page 36
  2009; Whyte 2014; Elnakat and Gomez 2015; Salehi et al. 2015; Buckingham and Kulcur 2017; Cohen 2017; Kronsell 2017; Lee and Zusman 2019). Women have a key role in the changing energy economy due to their demand and end use of energy resources  in  socially-gendered  productive  roles  in  food  production  and  processing,  health,  care, education, clothing purchases and maintenance, commerce, and other work both within and beyond the home    (Räty  and  Carlsson-Kanyama  2009;  Oparaocha  and  Dutta  2011;  Bob  and  Babugura  2014; Macgregor 2014; Perez et al. 2015; Bradshaw 2018; Clancy and Feenstra 2019; Clancy et al. 2019; Fortnam  et  al.  2019;  Rao  et  al.  2019a;  Quandt  2019;  Horen  Greenford  et  al.  2020;  Johnson  2020).  Women’s  work  and  decision-making  are  central  in  the  food  chain  and  agricultural  output  in  most developing countries, and in household management everywhere. Emissions from cooking fuels can cause serious health damages, and unsustainable extraction of biofuels can also hurt mitigation (Bailis et  al. 2015),   so  considering  health,  biodiversity and climate  tr  adeoffs and co-benefits is important (Rosenthal  et  al.  2018;  Aberilla  et  al.  2020;  Mazorra  et  al.  2020)  .    Policies  on  energy  use  and consumption  are  often  focused  on  technical  issues  related  to  energy  supply,  thereby  overlooking ‘demand-side’  factors  such  as  household  decision-making,  unpaid  work,  livelihoods  and  care (Himmelweit 2002; Perch 2011; Fumo 2014; Hans et al. 2019; Huyer and Partey 2020). Such gender-blindness represents the manifestation of wider issues related to political ideology, culture and tradition (Carr and Thompson 2014; Thoyre 2020; Perez et al. 2015; Fortnam et al. 2019).  Women, and all those who are economically and/or politically marginalised, often have less access to energy  and  use  less,  not  just  because  they  may  be  poorer  but  case  studies  show  because  their consumption choices are more ecologically-inclined and their energy use is more efficient (Lee et al. 2013; Permana et al. 2015; Li et al. 2019). Women’s carbon footprints are about 6-28% lower than men’s (with high variation across countries), mostly based on their lower meat consumption and lower vehicle  use  (Isenhour  and  Ardenfors  2009;  Räty  and  Carlsson-Kanyama  2010;  Barnett  et  al.  2012; Medina and Toledo-Bruno 2016; Ahmad et al. 2017; Fernström Nåtby and Rönnerfalk 2018; Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2009; Li et al. 2019).  Gender-based income redistribution in the form of pay equity for women could reduce emissions if the redistribution is revenue-neutral (Terry 2009; Dengler and Strunk 2018). Also, advances in female education and reproductive health, especially voluntary family planning, can contribute greatly to reducing world population growth (Abel et al. 2016; Dodson et al. 2020). 5-35  Total pages: 192Page 37
  2010; Speranza et al. 2010; Mekuriaw Bizuneh 2013; Mekuriaw 2017), and women are often the local educators, passing on and utilising  traditional and Indigenous knowledge (Ketlhoilwe 2013; Onyige 2017; Azong et al. 2018). in equity, their  votes  push  political  decision-making Higher female political participation, controlled for other factors, leads to higher stringency in climate policies, and results in lower GHG emissions (Cook et al. 2019). Gender equity also is correlated with lower  per  capita  CO2-eq  emissions  (Ergas  and  York  2012).  In  societies  where  women  have  more the  direction  of economic environmental/sustainable development policies, less high-emission militarisation, and more emphasis on equity and social policies e.g. via wealth and capital gains taxes (Resurrección 2013; UNEP 2013; Glemarec et al. 2016; Bryan et al. 2018; Crawford 2019; Ergas and York 2012).  Changing social norms on race and climate are linked and policy-relevant (Benegal 2018; Elias et al. 2018; Slocum 2018; Gach 2019;  Wallace-Wells  2019;  Temple  2020;  Drolet  2021).  For  all  these  reasons,  climate  policies  are strengthened  by  including  more  differently-situated  knowledge  and  diverse  perspectives,  such  as feminist expertise in the study of power (Bell et al. 2020a; Lieu et al. 2020); clarifying equity goals (e.g. distinguishing among ‘reach, ‘benefit’, and ‘empowerment’; obtaining disaggregated data and using clear  empirical  equity  measures;  and  confronting  deeply-engrained  inequities  in  society  (Lau  et  al. 2021).  Inclusivity  in  climate  governance  spans  mitigation-adaptation,  supply-demand  and  formal-informal sector boundaries in its positive effects (Morello Frosch et al. 2009; Dankelman 2010; Bryan and Behrman 2013; Habtezion 2013; Godfrey and Torres 2016; Walsh 2016; Flatø et al. 2017; Wilson et al. 2018; Goodrich et al. 2019; Perkins 2019; Bell et al. 2020b; Gür 2020).END BOX 5.4 HERE 5-36  Total pages: 192Page 38
  5.3.1Efficient service provision This  section  organises  demand  reductions  under  the  ASI  framework.  It  presents  service-oriented demand-side solutions consistent with decent living standards (Table 5.1) (Creutzig et al. 2018). The sharing economy, digitalisation, and the circular economy all can contribute to ASI strategies, with the circular  economy  tentatively  more  on  the  supply  side,  and  the  sharing  economy  and  digitalisation tentatively more on the demand side (see Section 5.3.4). These new service delivery models go beyond sectoral boundaries (IPCC sector chapter boundaries explained in Chapter 12) and take advantage of technological innovations, design concepts, and innovative forms of cooperation cutting across sectors to contribute to systemic changes worldwide. Some of these changes can be realised in the short term, such  as  energy  access,  while  others  may  take  a  longer  period,  such  as  radical  and  systemic  eco-innovations  like  shared  electric  autonomous  vehicles.  It  is  important  to  understand  benefits  and distributional impacts of these systemic changes. 5.3.1.1Integration of service provision solutions with A-S-I framework Assessment of service-related mitigation options within the ASI framework is aided by decomposition of  emissions  intensities  into  explanatory  contributing  factors,  which  depend  on  the  type  of  service delivered. Table 5.1 shows ASI options in selected sectors and services. It summarises resource, energy, and emissions intensities commonly used by type of service  (Cuenot et al. 2010; Lucon et al. 2014; Fischedick et al. 2014). Also relevant: the concepts of service provision adequacy (Arrow et al. 2004; Samadi et al. 2017), establishing the extents to which consumption levels exceed (e.g., high-calorie diets  contributing  to  health  issues  (Roy  et  al.  2012);  excessive  food  waste)  or  fall  short  of  (e.g., malnourishment)  service  level  sufficiency  (e.g.,  recommended  calories)  (Millward-Hopkins  et  al. 2020); and service level efficiency (e.g., effect of occupancy on the energy intensity of public transit passenger-km travelled (Schäfer and Yeh 2020). Service-oriented solutions in this chapter are discussed in the context of Table 5.1. Implementation of these solutions requires combinations of institutional, infrastructural, behavioural, socio-cultural, and business changes that are mentioned in Section 5.2 and discussed in Section 5.4.

Avoid options are  relevant  in  all  end-use  sectors,  namely,  teleworking  and  avoiding  long-haul  flights,  adjusting dwelling  size  to  household  size,  avoiding  short  life  span  product,  and  food  waste.  Cities  and  built environments can play an additional role. For example, more compact designs and higher accessibility reduce travel demand and translate into lower average floor space and corresponding heating/cooling and lighting demand, and thus between 5% to 20% of GHG emissions of end-use sectors (Creutzig et al. 2021b). Avoidance of food loss and wastage – which equalled 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2010-2016 (Mbow et al. 2019), while millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition – is a prime example (see Chapter 12). A key challenge in meeting global nutrition services is therefore to avoid food loss and waste while simultaneously raising nutrition levels to equitable standards globally. Literature results indicate that in developed economies consumers are the largest source of food waste, 5-38  Total pages: 192Page 40
  and that behavioural changes such as meal planning, use of leftovers, and avoidance of over-preparation can  be  important  service-oriented  solutions  (Gunders  et  al.  2017;  Schanes  et  al.  2018),  while improvements to expiration labels by regulators would reduce unnecessary disposal of unexpired items (Wilson et al. 2017) and improved preservation in supply chains would reduce spoilage (Duncan and Gulbahar 2019). ~931 million tons of food waste was generated in 2019 globally, 61% of which came from households, 26% from food service and 13% from retail.  Demand side mitigations are achieved through changing Socio-cultural factors, Infrastructure use and Technology adoption by various social actors in urban and other settlements, food choice and waste management  (high  confidence)  (Figure  5.7).  In  all  sectors,  end-use  strategies  can  help  reduce  the majority of emissions, ranging from 28.7% (4.13 GtCO2-eq) emission reductions in the industry sector, to 44.2% (7.96 GtCO2-eq) in the food sectors, to 66.75% (4.671 GtCO2-eq) emission reductions in the land transport sector, and 66% (5.763 GtCO2-eq) in the buildings sector. These numbers are median estimates  and  represent  benchmark  accounting.  Estimates  are  approximations,  as  they  are  simple products of individual assessments for each of the three  SIT options. If interactions were taken into account,  the  full  mitigation  potentials  may  be  higher  or  lower,  independent  of  relevant  barriers  to realizing the median potential estimates. See more in Supplementary Material II Chapter 5, Table SM2. Reduced food waste and dietary shifts have highly relevant repercussions in the land use sector that underpin  the  high  GHG  emission  reduction  potential.  Demand  side  measure  lead  to  changes  in consumption  of  land-based  resources  and  can  save  GHG  emissions  by  reducing  or  improving management of residues or making land areas available for other uses such as afforestation or bioenergy production (Smith et al. 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). Deforestation is the second largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, caused mainly by expanding forestry and agriculture and in many cases this agricultural expansion is driven by trade demand for food e. g. across the tropics, cattle and oilseed products accounts for half of the resulted deforestation carbon-emissions, embodied in international trade to China and Europe (Creutzig et al. 2019a; Pendrill et al. 2019). Benefits from shifts in diets and resulting lowered land pressure are also reflected in reductions of land degradation and improved.  Increased demand for biomass can increase the pressure on forest and conservation areas (Cowie et al. 2013)  and  poses  an  heightened  risk for  biodiversity, livelihoods,  and intertemporal  carbon  balances (Creutzig et al. 2021c; Lamb et al. 2016) requiring policy and regulations to ensure sustainable forest management which depends on forest type, region, management, climate, and ownership. This suggests that  demand-side  actions  hold  sustainability  advantages  over  the  intensive  use  of  bioenergy  and BECCS, but also enable land use for bioenergy by saving agricultural land for food.  5-39  Total pages: 192Page 41
  In  the  transport  sector,  ASI  opportunities  exist  at  multiple  levels,  comprehensively  summarised  in Bongardt  et  al  (2013),  Roy  et  al  (2021)  and  Sims  et  al  (2014)  (Chapter  10).  Modelling  based  on  a plethora of bottom-up insights and options reveals that a balanced portfolio of ASI policies brings the global transport sector emissions in line with global warming of not more than 1.5°C (Gota et al. 2019). For  example,  telework  may  be  a  significant  lever  for  avoiding  road  transport  associated  with  daily commutes, achievable through digitalisation, but its savings depend heavily on the modes, distances, and types of office use avoided (Hook et al. 2020) and whether additional travel is induced due to greater available time  (Mokhtarian  2002)  or  vehicle  use  by  other household  members  (Kim  et  al.  2015;  de Abreu e Silva and Melo 2018). More robustly, avoiding kilometres travelled through improved urban planning and smart logistical systems can lead to fuel, and, hence, emissions savings (IEA 2016, 2017a; Creutzig et al. 2015a; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018), or through avoiding long-haul flights (IEA 2021). For example, reallocating road and parking space to exclusive public transit lanes, protected bike lanes and pedestrian  priority streets can reduce  vehicle kilometres  travelled in  urban  areas  (ITF 2021).  At  the vehicle level, light weighting strategies (Fischedick et al. 2014) and avoiding inputs of carbon-intensive materials into vehicle manufacturing can also lead to significant emissions savings through improved fuel economy (Das et al. 2016; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b).  Socio-cultural factors such avoid long-haul flights and shifting to train wherever possible can contribute between 10% and 40% to aviation GHG emissions reduction by 2050 (Figure 5.7). Maritime transport (shipping)  emits  around  940  MtCO2 annually  and  is  responsible  for  about  2.5%  of  global  GHG emissions (IMO  2020).  Technology  measures  and  management  measures,  such  as  slow  steaming, weather  routing,  contra-rotating  propellers,  and  propulsion  efficiency  devices  can  deliver  more  fuel savings  between  1%  and  40%  than  the  investment  required  (Bouman  et  al.  2017).  For  details  see Supplementary Material II Chapter 5, Table SM2.In the buildings sector, avoidance strategies can occur at the end use or individual building operation level.  End use technologies/strategies such as the use of daylighting (Bodart and De Herde 2002) and lighting sensors can avoid demand for lumens from artificial light, while passive houses, thermal mass, and smart controllers can avoid demand for space conditioning services.  Eliminating standby power losses can avoid energy wasted for no useful service in many appliances/devices, which may reduce household electricity use by up to 10% (Roy et al. 2012). At the building level, smaller dwellings can reduce overall demand for lighting and space conditioning services, while smaller dwellings, shared housing, and building lifespan extension can all reduce the overall demand for carbon-intensive building materials such as concrete and steel  (Material Economics 2018; Pauliuk et al. 2021; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b). Emerging strategies for materials efficiency, such as 3D printing   to optimise the 5-40  Total pages: 192Page 42
  geometries and minimise the materials content of structural elements, may also play a key role if thermal performance  and  circularity  can  be  improved  (Mahadevan  et  al.  2020;  Adaloudis  and  Bonnin  Roca 2021). Several scenarios estimate an ‘avoid’ potential in the building sector, which includes reducing waste in superfluous floor space, heating and IT equipment, and energy use, of between 10 and 30%, in one case even by 50% (Nadel, Steven and Ungar 2019). For details see Chapter 9.  Socio-cultural factors and behavioral and social practices in energy saving like adaptive hearing and cooling by changing temperature can contribute about 15% to Buildings GHG emissions reduction by 2050 (Figure 5.7). Infrastructure use such as compact city and urban planning interventions, living floor space  rationalization,  and  access  to  low  carbon  architectural  design  has  about  20%  potential  in  the Buildings  GHG  emissions  reduction.  Technology  adoption,  particularly  access  to  energy  efficient technologies, and choice for installation of renewable can contribute between 30% and 70% to GHG emissions reeducation in Buildings sector. For details see Supplementary Material II Chapter 5, Table SM2 and Chapter 8 and 9 .  Shift strategies unique to the service-oriented perspective generally involve meeting service demands at much lower life-cycle energy, emissions, and resource intensities (Roy and Pal 2009), through such strategies as shifting from single-family to multi-family dwellings (reducing the materials intensity per unit  floor area  (Ochsendorf  et  al.  2011)), shifting from  passenger  cars to  rail  or  bus  (reducing  fuel, vehicle manufacturing, and infrastructure requirements (Chester and Horvath 2009), shifting materials to reduce resource and emissions intensities (e.g., low-carbon concrete blends (Scrivener and Gartner 2018))  and  shifting  from  conventional  to  additive  manufacturing  processes  to  reduce  materials requirements and improve end-use product performance (Huang et al. 2016, 2017). An important consideration in all ASI strategies is the potential for unintended rebound effects (Sorrell et al. 2009; Brockway et al. 2021) as indicated in Figures 5.8,  5.12, and 5.13a, which must be carefully avoided  through  various  regulatory  and  behavioural  measures  (Santarius  et  al.  2016)  and  in  many developing country contexts rebound effects can help in accelerated provision of affordable access to modern  energy  and  a  minimum  level  of  per  capita  energy  consumption  (Saunders  et  al.  2021; Chakravarty  and  Roy  2021).  Extending  the  lifespan  of  energy  inefficient  products  may  lead  to  net increases in emissions (Gutowski et al. 2011), whereas automated car sharing may reduce the number of cars manufactured at the expense of increased demand for passenger kilometres due to lower travel opportunity cost (Wadud et al. 2016) (see also 5.3.2). Avoid short life span products in favour of products with longer lifespan as a socio-cultural factor; infrastructure  use  such  as  increasing  the  re-usability  and  recyclability  of  product's  components  and materials;  and  adopting  the  materials-efficient  services  and  CO2-neutral  materials  have  about  29% indicative  potential  by  2050.  For  details  see  Supplementary  Material  II  Chapter  5,  Table  SM2  and Chapter 11. In  summary,  sector  specific  demand  side  mitigation options reflect important  role  of  socio-cultural, technological and infrastructural factors and interdependence among them (Figure 5.7). The assessment 5-41  Total pages: 192Page 43
  in Figure 5.7 shows by 2050 high emission reduction potential can be realised with demand side actions alone which can be complementary to supply side interventions with considerable impact by reducing need  for  capacity  addition  on  the  electricity  supply  system.  Integrated  cross  sectoral  actions  shown through sector coupling is also important for investment decision making and policy framing going beyond sector boundaries (high evidence and high agreement).   Figure 5.7 Demand-side mitigation options and indicative potentials Mitigation response options related to demand for services have been categorised into three domains: ‘socio-cultural factors’, related to social norms, culture, and individual choices and behaviour; ‘infrastructure use’, related to the provision and use of supporting infrastructure that enables individual choices and behaviour; and ‘technology adoption’, which refers to the uptake of technologies by end users. Potentials in 2050 are estimated using the International Energy Agency’s 2020 World Energy Outlook STEPS (Stated Policy Scenarios) as a baseline. This scenario is based on a sector-by-sector assessment of specific policies in place, as well as those that have been announced by countries by mid-2020. This scenario was selected due to the detailed representation of options across sectors and sub-sectors. The heights of the coloured columns represent the potentials on which there is a high level of agreement in the literature, based on a range of case studies. The range shown by the dots connected by dotted lines represents the highest and lowest potentials reported in the literature which have low to medium levels of agreement. The demand side potential of socio-cultural factor in food has two parts. Economic potential of demand reduction through socio-cultural factors alone is 1.9 GtCO2eq without considering LUC by diversion of agricultural land from food production to carbon sequestration purposes. If further changes in choice architectures and LUC due to this change in demand is considered indicative potential becomes 7 GtCO2eq. The electricity panel presents separately the mitigation potential from changes in electricity demand associated with enhanced electrification in end use sectors. Electrification increases electricity demand, while it is avoided though demand-side mitigation strategies. Load management refers to demand side flexibility that can be achieved through incentive design like time of use pricing/monitoring by artificial intelligence, diversification of storage facilities etc. NZE (IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario) is used to compute the impact of end use sector electrification, 5-42  Total pages: 192Page 44
  while the impact of demand side response options is based on bottom-up assessments. Dark grey columns show the emissions that cannot be avoided through demand-side mitigation options. The table indicates which demand-side mitigation options are included. Options are categorised according to: socio-cultural factors, infrastructure use, and technology adoption.

Source: Ivanova et al. 2020 5.3.2Technical tools to identify Avoid-Shift-Improve options Service delivery systems to satisfy a variety of service needs (e.g., mobility, nutrition, thermal comfort, etc.) comprise a series of interlinked processes to convert primary resources (e.g. coal, minerals) into useable products (e.g. electricity, copper wires, lamps, light bulbs). It is useful to differentiate between conversion  and  processing  steps  “upstream”  of  end-users  (mines,  power  plants,  manufacturing facilities) and “downstream”, i.e. those associated with end-users, including service levels, and direct well-being  benefits  for  people  (Kalt  et  al.  2019).  Illustrative  examples  of  such  resource  processing systems steps and associated conversion losses drawn from the literature are shown in Figure 5.9. in the form of resource processing cascades for energy (direct energy conversion efficiencies (Nakićenović et al. 1993; De Stercke 2014)), water use in food production systems (water use efficiency and embodied water losses in food delivery and consumption (Lundqvist et al. 2008; Sadras et al. 2011)), and materials 5-44  Total pages: 192Page 46

The aggregate efficiencies of service delivery chains is with 13-17% low.  Source: TWI2050 20185-45  Total pages: 192Page 47
 A  substantial  part  of  losses  happen  at  the  end-use  point  and  in  final  service  delivery  (where  losses account for 47 to 60% of aggregate systems losses for steel and energy respectively, and for 23% in the case  of  water  embodied  in  food,  i.e.  food  waste).  The  efficiency  of  service  delivery  (for  a  detailed discussion  cf.  (Brand-Correa  and  Steinberger  2017))  has  usually  both  a  technological  component (efficiency  of  end-use  devices  such  as  cars,  light  bulbs)  and  a  behavioural  component  (i.e.  how efficiently end-use devices are used, e.g. load factors, for a discussion of such behavioural efficiency improvement options see e.g. (Dietz et al. 2009; Laitner et al. 2009; Ehrhardt-Martinez 2015; Kane and Srinivas 2014; Lopes et al. 2017; Thaler 2015; Norton 2012). Using the example of mobility where service levels are usually expressed by passenger-km, the service delivery efficiency is thus a function of  the  fuel  efficiency  of  the  vehicle  and  its  drivetrain  (typically  only  about  20%-25%  for  internal combustion  engines,  but  close  to  100%  for  electric  motors)  plus  how  many  passengers  the  vehicle actually transports (load factor, typically as low as 20%-25%, i.e. one passenger per vehicle that could seat  4-5),  i.e.  an  aggregate  end-use  efficiency  of  between  4-6%  only.  Aggregated  energy  end-use efficiencies at the global level are estimated as low as 20% (De Stercke 2014), 13% for steel (recovered post-use scrap, Allwood and Cullen, 2012), and some 70% for food (including distribution losses and food wastes of some 30%, (Lundqvist et al. 2008). To harness additional gains in efficiency by shifting the focus in service delivery systems to the end-user can translate into large “upstream” resource reductions. For each unit of improvement at the end-use point of the service delivery system (examples shown in Figure 5.9), primary resource inputs are reduced between a factor of 6 to 7 units (water, steel, energy) (TWI2050 2018). For example, reducing energy needs for final service delivery equivalent to 1 EJ, reduces primary energy needs by some 7 EJ. There  is  thus  high  evidence  and  high  agreement  in  the  literature  that  the  leverage  effect  for improvements in end-use service delivery efficiency through behavioural, technological, and market organisational innovations is very large, ranging from a factor 6-7 (resource cascades) to up to a factor 10  to  20  (exergy  analysis)  with  the  highest  improvement  potentials  at  the  end-user  and  service provisioning levels (for systemic reviews see (Nakićenović et al. 1996a; Grubler et al. 2012b; Sousa et al. 2017). Also the literature shows high agreement that current conversion efficiencies are invariably low,  particularly  for  those  components  at  the  end-use  and  service  delivery  back  end  of  service provisioning systems. It also suggests that efficiencies might be actually even lower than those revealed by  direct  input-output  resource  accounting  as  discussed  above  (Figure  5.9).  Illustrative  exergy efficiencies of entire national or global service delivery systems range from 2.5% (USA, (Ayres 1989)) to 5% (OECD average, (Grubler et al. 2012b)) and 10% (global,  Nakićenović et al., 1996) respectively. Studies  that  adopt  more  restricted  systems  boundaries  either  leaving  out  upstream  resource processing/conversion or conversely end-use and service provision, show typical exergetic efficiencies between 15% (city of Geneva, cf. (Grubler et al. 2012a)) to below 25% (Japan, Italy, and Brazil, albeit with incomplete systems coverage that miss important conversion losses (Nakićenović et al. 1996b)). These findings are confirmed by more recent exergy efficiency studies that also include longitudinal time trend analysis  (Cullen and Allwood 2010; Serrenho et al. 2014; Guevara et al. 2016; Brockway et al. 2014, 2015). Figure 5.10 illustrates how energy demand reductions can be realized by improving the resource efficiency cascades shown in Figure 5.9 above. 5-46  Total pages: 192Figure 5.10 Realisable energy efficiency improvements by region and by end-use type between 2020 and 2050 in an illustrative Low Energy Demand scenario (in EJ). Efficiency improvements are decomposed by respective steps in the conversion chain from primary energy to final, and useful energy, and to service delivery and disaggregated by region (developed and developing countries) and end-use type (buildings, transport, materials). Improvements are dominated by improved efficiency in service delivery (153 EJ) and by more efficient end-use energy conversion (134 EJ). Improvements in service efficiency in transport shown here are conservative in this scenario but could be substantially higher with the full adoption of integrated urban shared mobility schemes. Increases in energy use due to increases in service levels and system effects of transport electrification (grey bars on top of first pair in the bar charts) that counterbalance some of the efficiency improvements are also shown. Examples of options for efficiency improvements and decision involved (grey text in the chart), the relative weight of generic demand-side strategies (improve, shift, avoid blue arrows), as well as prototype actors involved are also illustrated Data: Figure 5.9 and Grubler et al. 2018.  5.3.3Low demand scenarios  Long-term  mitigation  scenarios  play  a  crucial  role  in  climate  policy  design  in  the  near  term,  by illuminating transition pathways, interactions between supply-side and demand-side interventions, their timing,  and  the  scales  of  required  investments  needed  to  achieve  mitigation  goals  (see  Chapter  3). Historically, most long-term mitigation scenarios have taken technology-centric approaches with heavy reliance on supply-side solutions and the use of carbon dioxide removal, particularly in 1.5oC scenarios (Rogelj  et  al.  2018).  Comparatively  less  attention  has  been  paid  to  deep  demand-side  reductions incorporating socio-cultural  change and the cascade effects (see  Section 5.3.2) associated with ASI strategies, primarily due to limited past representation of such service-oriented interventions in long-term integrated assessment models (IAMs) and energy systems models (ESMs) (Napp et al. 2019; van 5-47  Total pages: 192In  response  to  1.5oC  ambitions,  and  a  growing  desire  to  identify  participatory  pathways  with  less reliance  on  carbon  dioxide  removal  with  high  uncertainty,  some  recent  IAM  and  ESM  mitigation scenarios have explored the role of deep demand-side energy and resource use reduction potentials at global and regional levels. Table 5.2 summarises long-term scenarios that aimed to: minimise service-level  energy  and  resource  demand  as  a  central  mitigation  tenet;  specifically  evaluate  the  role  of behavioural  change  and  ASI  strategies;  and/or  to  achieve  a  carbon  budget  with  limited/no  carbon dioxide removal.  From  assessment  of this  emerging body  of literature,  several general  observations arise and are presented below. First, socio-cultural changes within transition pathways can offer Gigaton-scale CO2 savings potential at the global level, and therefore represent a substantial overlooked strategy in traditional mitigation scenarios. Two lifestyle change scenarios conducted with the IMAGE IAM suggested that behaviour and cultural changes such heating and cooling set-point adjustments, shorter showers, reduced appliance use, shifts to public transit, less meat intensive diets, and improved recycling can deliver an additional 1.7  Gt and  3  GtCO2  savings  in  2050,  beyond the savings  achieved in traditional technology-centric mitigation  scenarios  for  the  2oC  and  1.5oC  ambitions,  respectively  (van  Sluisveld  et  al.  2016;  Van Vuuren  et  al.  2018).  In  its  Sustainable  Development  Scenario,  the  IEA’s  behavioural  change  and resource efficiency wedges deliver around 3 GtCO2-eq reduction in 2050, combined savings roughly equivalent to those of solar PV that same year (IEA 2019a). In Europe, a GCAM scenario evaluating combined lifestyle changes such as teleworking, travel avoidance, dietary shifts, food waste reductions, and recycling reduced cumulative EU-27 CO2 emissions 2011-2050 by up to 16% compared to an SSP2 baseline (van de Ven et al. 2018). Also in Europe, a multi-regional input-output analysis suggested that adoption of low-carbon consumption practices could reduce carbon footprints by 25%, or 1.4 Gt (Moran et  al.  2020).  A  global  transport  scenario  suggests  that  transport  sector  emission  can  decline  from business as usual 18 GtCO2-eq  to 2 GtCO2-eq if ASI strategies are deployed (Gota et al. 2019), a value considerably below the estimates provided in IAM scenarios that have limited or no resolution in ASI strategies (compare with Chapter 10).  The  IEA’s  Net  Zero  Emissions  by  2050  (NZE)  scenario,  in  which  behavioural  changes  lead  to  1.7 GtCO2  savings  in  2030,  expresses  the  substantial  mitigation  opportunity  in  terms  of  low-carbon technology equivalencies: to achieve same emissions reductions, the global share of EVs in the NZE would have to increase from 20% to 45% by 2030 or the number of installed heat pumps in homes in the NZE would have to increase from 440 to 660 million in 2030 (IEA 2021). In  light  of  the  limited  number  of  mitigation  scenarios  that  represent  socio-behavioural  changes explicitly, there is medium evidence in the literature that such changes can reduce emissions at regional and global levels, but high agreement within that literature that such changes hold up to gigaton-scale CO2 emissions reduction potentials. Second, pursuant to the ASI principle, deep demand reductions require parallel pursuit of behavioural change and advanced energy efficient technology deployment; neither is sufficient on its own. The LED scenario (Figure 5.10) combines behavioural and technological change consistent with numerous ASI strategies that leverage digitalisation, sharing, and circular economy megatrends to deliver decent living standards while reducing global final energy demand in 2050 to 245 EJ (Grubler et al. 2018). This value is 40% lower than final energy demand in 2018 (IEA 2019a), and a lower 2050 outcome than other IAM/ESM scenarios with primarily technology-centric mitigation approaches (IEA 2017b; Teske et al. 2015). In the IEA’s B2DS scenario, avoid/shift in the transport sector accounts for around 2 GtCO2-eq yr-1 in 2060, whereas parallel vehicle efficiency improvements increase the overall mitigation wedge to 5.5 GtCO2-eq yr-1 in 2060 (IEA 2017b).  Through a combination of behavioural change and energy efficient technology adoption, the IEA’s NZE requires only 340 EJ of global final energy demand with universal energy access in 2050, which is among the lowest of IPCC net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021).   Third, low demand scenarios can reduce both supply side capacity additions and the need for carbon capture and removal technologies to reach emissions targets. Of the scenarios listed in Table 5.2 one (LED-MESSAGE)  reaches  2050  emissions  targets  with  no  carbon  capture  or  removal  technologies (Grubler et al. 2018), whereas others report significant reductions in reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) compared to traditional technology-centric mitigation pathways (Liu et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), with the IEA’s NZE notably requiring the least carbon dioxide removal (CDR) (1.8 Gt in 2050) and primary bioenergy (100 EJ in 2050) compared to IPCC net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021).    Fourth, the costs of reaching mitigation targets may be lower when incorporating ASI strategies for deep energy and resource demand reductions. The TIAM-Grantham low demand scenarios displayed reduction in mitigation costs (0.87–2.4% of GDP), while achieving even lower cumulative emissions to 2100 (228 to ~475 GtCO2) than its central demand scenario (741 to 1066 GtCO2), which had a cost range of (2.4–4.1% of GDP) (Napp et al. 2019). The GCAM behavioural change scenario concluded that domestic emission savings would contribute to reduce the costs of achieving the internationally agreed climate goal of the EU by 13.5% to 30% (van de Ven et al. 2018).  The AIMS lifestyle case indicated  that  mitigation  costs,  expressed  as  global  GDP  loss,  would  be  14%  lower  than  the  SSP2 reference scenario in 2100, for both 2oC and 1.5oC mitigation targets (Liu et al. 2018).  These findings mirror  earlier  AIM  results,  which  indicated  lower  overall  mitigation  costs  for  scenarios  focused  on energy service demand reductions (Fujimori et al. 2014).  In the IEA’s NZE, behavioural changes that avoid energy and resource demand save USD4 trillion (cumulatively 2021-2050) compared to if those emissions  reductions  were  achieved  through  low‐carbon  electricity  and  hydrogen  deployment  (IEA 2021). Based  on  the  limited  number  of  long-term  mitigation  scenarios  that  explicitly  represent  demand reductions enabled by ASI strategies, there is  medium evidence but with high agreement within that literature  that  such  scenarios  can  reduce  dependence  on  supply-side  capacity  additions  and  carbon capture and removal technologies with opportunity for lower overall mitigation costs. If the limitations within most IAMs and ESMs regarding non-inclusion of granular ASI strategy analysis can be addressed, it will expand and improve long-term mitigation scenarios (Van den Berg et al. 2019). These include broader inclusion of mitigation costs for behavioural interventions (van Sluisveld et al. 2016),  much  greater  incorporation  of  rebound  effects  (Krey  et  al.  2019),  including  from  improved efficiencies  (Brockway  et  al.  2021)  and  avoided  spending  (van  de  Ven  et  al.  2018),  improved representation of materials cycle to assess resource cascades (Pauliuk et al. 2017), broader coverage of behavioural change (Samadi et al. 2017; Saujot et al. 2020), improved consideration of how economic development affects service demand (Semieniuk et al. 2021), explicit representation of intersectoral linkages related to digitalisation, sharing economy, and circular economy strategies (see Section 5.3.4), and  institutional,  political,  social,  entrepreneurial,  and  cultural  factors  (van  Sluisveld  et  al.  2018). Addressing  the  current  significant  modelling  limitations  will  require  increased  investments  in  data generation and collection, model development, and inter-model comparisons,  with a particular focus  on  socio-behavioural research that has been underrepresented in mitigation research funding to date (Overland and Sovacool 2020). Covid-19 interacts with demand-side scenarios (Box 5.2). Energy demand will mostly likely be reduced between 2020 and 2030 compared to default pathway, and if recovery is steered towards low energy demand, carbon prices for a 1.5 °C-consistent pathway will be by 19%, energy supply investments until 2030 by USD1.8 trillion reduced, and the pressure to rapidly upscale renewable energy technologies will be softened (Kikstra et al. 2021a).

While these trends started mostly independently, rapid digitalisation is creating new synergistic opportunities with systemic potential to improve the quality of jobs, particularly in 5-56  Total pages: 192In the context of service provision, there are numerous opportunities for consumers to buy, subscribe to,  adopt,  access,  install  or  use  digital  goods  and  services  (Wilson  et  al.  2020b).  Digitalisation  has opened up new possibilities across all domains of consumer activity, from travel and retail to domestic living  and  energy  use.  Digital  platforms  allow  surplus  resources  to  be  identified,  offered  ,  shared, transacted and exchanged (Frenken 2017). Real-time information flows on consumers’ preferences and needs mean service provision can be personalised, differentiated, automated, and optimised (TWI2050 2019). Rapid innovation cycles and software upgrades drive continual improvements in performance and responsiveness to consumer behaviour. These characteristics of digitalisation enable new business models  and  services  that  affect  both  service  demand,  from  shared-ridehailing  (ITF  2017a)  to  smart heating (IEA 2017a), and how services are provisioned, from online farmers’ markets (Richards and Hamilton 2018) to peer-to-peer electricity trading to enable distributed power systems (Morstyn et al. 2018). In many cases, digitalisation provides a ‘radical functionality’ that enables users to do or accomplish something  that  they  could  not  do  before  (Nagy  et  al.  2016).  Indeed  the  consumer  appeal  of  digital innovations  varies  widely,  from  choice,  convenience,  flexibility  and  control  to  relational  and  social benefits (Pettifor and Wilson 2020). Reviewing over 30 digital goods and services for mobility, food buying and domestic living, Wilson et al. (2020b)also found shared elements of appeal across multiple innovations including (i) making use of surplus, (ii) using not owning, (iii) being part of wider networks, and (iv) exerting greater control over service provisioning systems. Digitalisation thus creates a strong value  proposition  for  certain  consumer  niches.  Concurrent  diffusion  of  many  digital  innovations amplifies their disruptive potential (Schuelke-Leech 2018; Wilson et al. 2019b). Besides basic mobile telephone  service  for  communication,  digital  innovations  have  been  primarily  geared  to  population groups with high purchasing power, and too little to the needs of poor and vulnerable people. The long-term sustainability implications of digitalised services hinge on four factors: (1) the direct energy  demands  of  connected  devices  and  the  digital  infrastructures  (i.e.  data  centres  and communication  networks)  that  provide  necessary  computing,  storage,  and  communication  services (Chapter 9.4.6); (2) the systems-level energy and resource efficiencies that may be gained through the provision of digital services (Wilson et al. 2020b); (3) the resource, material, and waste management requirements  of  the  billions  of  ICT  devices  that  comprise  the  world’s  digital  systems  (Belkhir  and Elmeligi  2018;  Malmodin  and  Lundén  2018)  and  (4)  the  magnitude  of  potential  rebound  effects  or induced  energy  demands  that  might  unleash  unintended  and  unsustainable  demand  growth,  such  as autonomous vehicles inducing more frequent and longer journeys due to reduced travel costs (Wadud et al. 2016). Estimating digitalisation’s direct energy demand has historically been hampered by lack of consistent global data on IT device stocks, their power consumption characteristics, and usage patterns, for both consumer devices and the data centres and communication networks behind them. As a result, quantitative  estimates  vary  widely,  with  literature  values  suggesting  that  consumer  devices,  data centres, and data networks account for anywhere from 6% to 12% of global electricity use  (Gelenbe and Caseau 2015; Cook et al. 2017; Malmodin and Lundén 2018). For example, within the literature on data centres, top-down models that project energy use on the basis of increasing demand for internet services tend to predict rapid global energy use growth, (Andrae and Edler 2015; Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Liu et al. 2020a), whereas bottom-up models that consider data center technology stocks and their energy efficiency trends tend to predict slower but still positive growth (Hintemann and Hinterholzer 2019; Masanet et al. 2020; Shehabi et al. 2018; Malmodin 2020). Yet there is growing concern that 5-57  Total pages: 192As digitalisation proliferates, an important policy objective is therefore to invest in data collection and monitoring systems and energy demand models of digitalised systems to guide technology and policy investment decisions for addressing potential direct energy demand growth (IEA 2017a) and potentially concomitant growth in e-waste. However, the net systems-level energy and resource efficiencies gained through the provision of digital services could play an important role in dealing with climate change and other environmental challenges (Masanet and Matthews 2010; Melville 2010; Elliot 2011; Watson et al. 2012; Gholami et al. 2013; Añón  Higón  et  al.  2017).  As  shown  in  Figure  5.12,  assessments  of  numerous  digital  service opportunities for mobility, nutrition, shelter, and education and entertainment suggest that net emissions benefits  can  be  delivered  at  the  systems  level,  although  these  effects  are  highly  context-dependent. Importantly, evidence of potential negative outcomes due to rebound effects, induced demand, or life-cycle trade-offs can also be observed. For example, telework has been shown to reduce emissions where long and/or energy-intensive commutes are avoided, but can lead to net emissions increases in cases where greater non-work vehicle use occurs or only short, low-emissions commutes (e.g., via public transit) are avoided (Viana Cerqueira et al. 2020; IEA 2020a; Hook et al. 2020). Similarly, substitution of physical media by digital alternatives may lead to emissions increases where greater consumption is fuelled,  whereas  a  shift  to  3D  printed  structures  may  require  more  emissions-intensive  concrete formulations or result in reduced thermal energy efficiency  leading to life-cycle emissions increases (Mahadevan et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020). Furthermore, digitalisation, automation and artificial intelligence, as general-purpose technologies, may lead to a plethora of new products and applications that are likely to be efficient on their own but that may also lead to undesirable changes or absolute increases in demand for products (Figure 5.12). For example, last-mile delivery in logistics is both expensive and cumbersome. Battery-powered drones enable a delivery of goods at similar life-cycle emissions to delivery vans (Stolaroff et al. 2018). At the same  time,  drone  delivery  is  cheaper  in  terms  of  time  (immediate  delivery)  and  monetary  costs (automation saves the highest cost component: personnel) (e.g. (Sudbury and Hutchinson 2016)). As a result,  demand  for  package  delivery may increase rapidly.  Similarly,  automated vehicles  reduce  the costs of time, parking, and personnel, and therefore may dramatically increase vehicle mileage (Wadud et al. 2016; Cohen and Cavoli 2019). On-demand electric scooters offer mobility access preferable to passenger  cars,  but  can  replace  trips  otherwise  taken  on  public  transit  (de  Bortoli  and  Christoforou 2020) and can come with significant additional energy requirements for night time system rebalancing (Hollingsworth et al. 2019, ITF 2020). The energy requirements of cryptocurrencies is also a growing concern,  although  considerable  uncertainty  exists  surrounding  the  energy  use  of  their  underlying blockchain infrastructure  (Vranken 2017; de Vries 2018; Stoll et al. 2019). For example, while it is clear that the energy requirements of global Bitcoin mining have grown significantly since 2017, recent literature indicates a wide range of estimates for  2020 (47 TWh to 125 TWh) due to data gaps and differences in modelling approaches (Lei et al. 2021).  Initial estimates of the computational intensity of  artificial  intelligence  algorithms  suggest  that  energy  requirements  may  be  enormous  without concerted  effort  to improve  efficiencies,  especially  on  the  computational  side  (Strubell  et al.  2020). Efficiency gains enabled by digitalisation, in terms of reduced GHG emissions or energy use per service unit may be overcompensated by activity/scale effects.  Figure 5.12Studies assessing net changes in CO2 emissions, energy use, and activity levels indicate mitigation potentials for numerous end user-oriented digitalisation solutions, but also risk of increased emissions due to inefficient substitutions, induced demand, and rebound effects.  90 studies were assessed with 207 observations (indicated by vertical bars) including those based on empirical research, attributional and consequential life-cycle assessments, and techno-economic analyses and scenarios at different scales, which are not directly comparable but useful for indicating the directionality and determinants of net emissions, energy, and activity effects.

Direct energy demand can be managed through continued investments in and incentives for energy-efficient data centres, networks, and end-use devices (Masanet et al. 2011; Avgerinou et al. 2017; IEA 2017a; Koronen et al. 2020). Shifts to  low-carbon power are a particularly important strategy being undertaken by data centre and network operators (Cook et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2020), which might be adopted  across  the  digital  device  spectrum  as  a  proactive  mitigation  strategy  where  data  demands outpace hardware efficiency gains, which may be approaching limits in the near future (Koomey et al. 2011).  Most recently, data centres are being investigated as a potential resource for demand response  and load balancing in renewable power grids (Zheng et al. 2020; Koronen et al. 2020), while a large bandwidth  for  improving  software  efficiency  has  been  suggested  for  overcoming  slowing  hardware efficiency gains (Leiserson et al. 2020). Ensuring efficiency benefits of digital services while avoiding potential rebound effects and demand surges will require early and proactive public policies to avoid excess  energy  use  (WBGU  2019;  TWI2050  2019),  which  will  also  necessitate  investments  in  data collection and monitoring systems to ensure that net mitigation benefits are realised and that unintended consequences can be identified early and properly managed (IEA 2017a).  Within  a  small  but  growing  body  of  literature  on  the  net  effects  of  digitalisation,  there  is  medium evidence  that  digitalised  consumer  services  can  reduce  overall  emissions,  energy  use,  and  activity levels, with medium agreement on the scale of potential savings with the important caveat that induced demand and rebound effects must be managed carefully to avoid negative outcomes. 5.3.4.2The sharing economy Opportunities to increase service per product includes peer-to-peer based sharing of goods and services such as housing, mobility, and tools. Hence, consumable products become durable goods delivering a “product  service”,  which  potentially  could  provide  the  same  level  of  service  with  fewer  products (Fischedick, M. et al. 2014).The sharing economy is an old practice of sharing assets between many without transferring ownership, which has been made new through focuses on sharing underutilised products/assets in ways that promotes flexibility and convenience, often in a highly developed context via gig economy/ online platforms. However, sharing economy offers the potential to shift from ‘asset-heavy’ ownership to ‘asset-light’ access, especially in developing countries (Retamal 2019). General conclusions on the sharing economy as a framework for climate change mitigation are challenging and are better broken down to specific subsystems (Mi and Coffman 2019). See more in Supplementary Material I Chapter 5, SM.5.4.3. Shared mobility Shared mobility is characterised by the sharing of an asset (e.g., a bicycle, e-scooter, vehicle), and the use of technology (i.e. apps and the Internet) to connect users and providers. It succeeded by identifying market inefficiencies and transferring control over transactions to consumers. Even though most shared mobility providers operate privately, their services can be considered as part of a public transport system in so far as it is accessible to most transport users and does not require private asset ownership. Shared mobility reduces GHG emissions if it substitutes for more GHG intensive travel (usually private car travel) (Martin and Shaheen 2011; Shaheen and Cohen 2019; Shaheen and Chan 2016; Santos et al. 2018; Axsen and Sovacool 2019), and especially if it changes consumer behaviour in the long run “by shifting personal transportation choices from ownership to demand-fulfilment” (Mi and Coffman 2019).  Demand is an important driver for energy use and emissions because decreased cost of travel time by sharing an asset (e.g. vehicle) could lead to an increase in emissions, but a high level of vehicle sharing could  reduce  negative  impacts  associated  with  this  (Brown  and  Dodder  2019).  One  example  is  the megacity Kolkata, India, which has as many as twelve different modes of public transportation options that co-exist and offer means of mobility to its 14 million citizens (see Box 5.7). Most public transport modes are shared mobility options ranging from sharing between two people in a rickshaw or between a few hundred in metro or sub-urban trains. Sharing also happens informally as daily commuters avail shared taxis and neighbours borrow each other’s car or bicycle for urgent or day trips. Page 62
  2016; Bardhi and Eckhardt 2012); Uber-like ridehailing services (Wallsten 2015; Angrist et al. 2017); and ride pooling using private vehicles shared by passengers to a common destination (Liyanage et al. 2019; Shaheen and Cohen 2019). The latest model – ride pooling – is promising in terms of congestion and per capita CO2 emissions reductions and is a common practice in developing countries, however is challenging  in  terms  of  waiting  and  travel  time,  comfort,  and  convenience,  relative  to  private  cars (Santos et al. 2018; Shaheen and Cohen 2019). The other three models often yield profits to private parties, but remain mostly unrelated to reduction in CO2 emissions (Santos et al. 2018). Shared travel models, especially Uber-like models, are criticised because of the flexibilisation of labour, especially in developing countries, in which unemployment rates and  unregulated labour markets lie a foundation of precarity that lead many workers to seek out wide-ranging means towards patching together a living (Ettlinger 2017; Wells et al. 2020). Despite the advantages of the shared mobility such as convenience and affordability, consumers may also perceive risk formed by possible physical injury from strangers or unexpected poor service quality (Hong et al. 2019). From a mitigation perspective, the current state of shared mobility looks at best questionable (Fishman et al. 2014; Ricci 2015; Zhang et al. 2019; Zhang and Mi 2018; Creutzig et al. 2019b; Martin 2016; Mi and  Coffman  2019).  Transport  entrepreneurs  and  government  officials  often  conflate  ‘smart’  and “shared’ vehicle with ‘sustainable’ mobility, a conflation not withstanding scrutiny (Noy and Givoni 2018).  Surveys  demonstrate  that  many  users  take  free-floating  car  sharing  instead  of  public  transit, rather than to replace their private car (Herrmann et al. 2014); while in the United States, ride hailing and  sharing  data  indicate  that  these  services  have  increased  road  congestion  and  lowered  transit ridership, with an insignificant change in vehicle ownership, and may further lead to net increases in energy use and CO2 emissions due to deadheading (Diao et al. 2021; Ward et al. 2021). If substitution effects and deadheading, which is the practice of allowing employees of a common carrier to use a vehicle as a non-revenue passenger, are accounted for, flexible motor-cycle sharing in Djakarta is at best neutral to overall GHG emissions (Suatmadi et al. 2019). Passenger surveys conducted in Denver indicated that around 22% of all trips travelled with Uber and Lyft would have been travelled by transit, 12% would have walked or biked, and another 12% of induced demand or passengers that would not have travelled at all (Henao and Marshall 2019).  Positive effects can be realised directly in bike sharing due to its very low marginal transport emissions. For example, in 2016, bike sharing in Shanghai reduced CO2 emissions by 25ktCO2 with additional benefits to air quality (Zhang and Mi 2018). However, also bike-sharing can increase emissions from motor vehicle usage when inventory management is not optimised during maintenance, collection, and redistribution of dock-less bikes (Fishman et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2019; Mi and Coffman 2019). Shared mobility scenarios demonstrate that GHG emission reduction can be substantial when mobility systems and digitalisation is regulated. Some studies model that ride pooling with electric cars (6 to 16 seats, which shifts the service to a more efficient transport mode (e.g., electric vehicle) and improves its carbon intensity by cutting GHG emissions by one-third (International Transport Forum 2016), and 63-82%  per  mile  compared  to  a  privately  owned  hybrid  vehicle  in  2030,  87  to  94%  lower  than  a privately owned, gasoline-powered vehicle in 2014 (Greenblatt and Saxena 2015). This also realises 95% reduction in space required for public parking; total vehicle kilometres travelled would be 37% lower than the present day, although each vehicle would travel ten times the total distance of current vehicles (International Transport Forum 2016). Studies of Berlin and Lisbon demonstrate that sharing strategies could reduce the number of cars by more than 90%, also saving valuable street space for human-scale  activity  (Bischoff  and  Maciejewski  2016;  Martinez  and  Viegas  2017;  Creutzig  et  al. 2019b).  The impacts  will also depend  on sharing  levels  –  concurrent  or  sequential  – and the future modal  split  among  public  transit,  automated  electric  vehicles  fleets,  and  shared  or  pooled  rides. Page 63
  Evidence from attributional life-cycle assessments (LCAs) of ride-hailing, whether Uber-like or by taxi, suggests that the key determinants of net emissions effects are average vehicle occupancy and vehicle powertrain,  with high-occupancy and electric  drivetrain  cars  deliver the  greatest  emissions  benefits, even  rivalling  traditional  metro/urban  rail  and  bus  options  (Figure  5.13b).  It  is  possible  that  shared automated electric vehicles fleets could become widely used without many shared rides, and single or even zero occupant vehicles will continue to dominate the majority of vehicle trips. It is also feasible that shared rides could become more common, if automation makes route deviation more efficient, more cost-effective,  and  more  convenient,  increasing  total  travel  substantially  (Wadud  et  al.  2016).  Car sharing with automated vehicles could even worsen congestion and emissions by generating additional travel demand (Rubin et al. 2016). Travel time in autonomous vehicles can be used for other activities but driving and travel costs are expected to decrease, which most likely will induce additional demand for auto travel (Moeckel and Lewis 2017) and could even create incentives for further urban sprawl. More generally, increased efficiency generated by big data and smart algorithms may generate rebound effects in demand and potentially compromise the public benefits of their efficiency promise (Gossart 2015). In many countries, shared mobility and ride pooling is often the norm. Here the challenge is to improve service quality to keep users in shared mobility and public transport (see Box 5.7). A key barrier in cities like Nairobi is the lack of public involvement of users and sustainability experts in designing transport  systems,  leaving  planning  to  transport  engineers,  and  thus  preventing  inclusive  shared mobility system design (Klopp 2012). Altogether, travel behaviour, business models, and especially public policy will be key components in determining how pooling and shared automated electric vehicles impacts unfold (Shaheen and Cohen 2019). Urban-scale governance of smart mobility holds potential for prioritizing public transit and the use of public spaces for human activities, managing the data as a digital sustainable commons (e.g., via the  installation  of  a  Central  Information  Officer,  as  in  Tel  Aviv),  and  managing  the  social  and environmental risks of smart mobility to realise its benefits (Creutzig et al. 2019b). Pricing of energy use and GHG emissions will be helpful to achieve these goals. The governance of shared mobility is complicated,  as  it  involves  many  actors,  and  is  key  to  realise  wider  benefits  of  shared  mobility (Akyelken et al. 2018). New actors, networks and technologies enabling shared mobility are already fundamentally challenging how transport is governed worldwide. This is not a debate about state versus non-state actors but instead about the role the state takes within these new networks to steer, facilitate and also reject different elements of the mobility system (Docherty et al. 2018).Shared accommodation In developing countries and in many student accommodations globally, shared accommodation allows affordable  housing  for  a  large  part  of  the  population.  For  example,  living  arrangements  are  built expressly  around  the  practice  of  sharing  toilets,  bathrooms  and  kitchens.  While  the  sharing  of  such facilities  does  connote  a  lower  level  of  service  provision  and  quality  of  life,  it  provides access  to a consumer base with very low and unreliable incomes. Thus, sharing key facilities can help guarantee the  provision  of  affordable  housing  (Gulyani  et  al.  2018).  In  developed  countries,  large-scale developments are targeting students and ‘young professionals’ by offering shared accommodation and services. Historically shared accommodation has been part of the student life due to its flexible and affordable  characteristics.  However,  the  expansion  of  housing  supply  through  densification  can  use shared  facilities  as  an  instrument  to  “commercialize  small  housing  production,  while  housing affordability and accessibility are threatened” (Uyttebrouck et al. 2020). Page 64
  With  respect  to  travel  accommodations,  several  models  are  emerging  in  which  accommodation  is offered to, or shared with, travellers by private people organised by business-driven or non-profit online platforms.  Accommodation  sharing  includes  P2P,  ICT-enabled,  short-term  renting,  swapping, borrowing or lending of existing privately-owned idling lodging facilities (Voytenko Palgan et al. 2017; Möhlmann 2015). With  shared  accommodation  services  via  the  platform  economy,  there  may  be  risks  of  negative sustainability effects, such as rebound effects caused by increased travel frequency (Tussyadiah and Pesonen 2016). This is particularly a problem if apartments are removed from long-term rental markets, thus indirectly inducing construction activities, with substantial GHG emissions on their own. However, if  a  host  shares  their  accommodation  with  a  guest,  the  use  of  some  resources,  such  as  heating  and lighting,  is  shared,  thereby  leading  to  more  efficient  resource  use  per  capita  (Chenoweth  2009; Voytenko Palgan et al. 2017).  Given the nascence of shared accommodation via the platform economy, quantifications  of  its  systems-level  energy  and  emissions  impacts  are  lacking  in  the  literature, representing an important area for future study.  Mitigation potentials of sharing economy strategies Sharing economy initiatives play a central role in enabling individuals to share underutilised products. While the literature on the net effects of sharing economy strategies is still limited, available studies have  presented  different  mitigation  potentials  to  date,  as  shown  in  Figure  5.13.  For  many  sharing economy strategies, there is a risk of negative rebound and induced demand effects, which may occur by changing consuming patterns, e.g., if savings from sharing housing are used to finance air travel. Thus, the mitigation potentials of sharing economy strategies will depend on stringent public policy and consumer awareness that reigns in run-away consumption effects. Shared economy solutions generally relate to the “Avoid” and “Shift” strategies (see Sections 5.1 and 5.3.2). On the one hand, they hold potential for providing similar or improved services for well-being (mobility, shelter) at reduced energy and resource input, with the proper policy signals and consumer responses. On the other hand, shared economy strategies may increase emissions, e.g., shared mobility may shift activity away from public transit and lead to lower vehicle occupancy, deadheading, and use of inefficient shared vehicles (Merlin 2019;  Jones  and  Leibowicz  2019;  Bonilla-Alicea  et  al.  2020;  Ward  et  al.  2021).    Similarly  to digitalisation, there is medium evidence that sharing economy can reduce overall emissions, energy use, and activity levels, with medium agreement on the scale of potential savings if induced demand and rebound effects can be carefully managed to avoid negative outcomes.  5-63  Total pages: 192Page 65

  The circular economy While the demands for energy and materials will increase until 2060 following the traditional linear model  of  production  and  consumption,  resulting  in  serious  environmental  consequences  (OECD 2019b),  the  circular  economy  (CE)  provides  strategies  for  reducing  societal  needs  for  energy  and primary  materials  to  deliver  the  same  level  of  service  with  lower  environmental  impacts.  The  CE framework embodies multiple schools of thought with roots in a number of related concepts (Blomsma and Brennan 2017; Murray et al. 2017), including cradle to cradle (McDonough and Braungart 2002), performance economy (Stahel 2016), biomimicry (Benyus 1997),  green economy (Loiseau et al. 2016) and  industrial  ecology  (Saavedra  et  al.  2018).  As  a  result,  there  are  also many definitions  of  CE:  a systematic literature review identified 114 different definitions (Kirchherr et al. 2017). One of the most comprehensive models is suggested by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Potting et al. 2018), which defines ten strategies for circularity: Refuse (R0), Rethink (R1), Reduce (R2), Reuse (R3), Repair (R4), Refurbish (R5), Remanufacture (R6), Repurpose (R7), Recycle (R8), and Recover energy (R9). Overall, the definition of CE is contested, with varying boundary conditions chosen. As illustrated in Figure 5.11, the CE overlaps with both the sharing economy and digitalisation megatrends.  In line with the principles of SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), the essence of building CE is to retain as much value as possible from products and components when they reach the end of their useful life in a given application (Linder and Williander 2017; Lewandowski 2016; Lieder and Rashid  2016;  Stahel  2016).  This  requires  an  integrated  approach  during  the  design  phase  that,  for example,  extends  product usage and ensures recyclability  after  use  (de  Coninck  et al. 2018).  While traditional “improve” strategies tend to focus on direct energy and carbon efficiency, service-oriented strategies focus on reducing life-cycle emissions through harnessing the leverage effect (Creutzig et al. 2018). The development of closed-loop models in service-oriented businesses can increase resource and energy efficiency, reducing emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation goals on national, regional,  and  global  levels  (Johannsdottir  2014;  Korhonen  et  al.  2018).  Key  examples  include remanufacturing of consumer products to extend lifespans while maintaining adequate service levels (Klausner  et  al.  1998),  reuse  of  building  components  to  reduce  demand  for  primary  materials  and construction  processes  (Shanks  et  al.  2019),  and  improved  recycling  to  reduce  upstream  resource pressures (IEA 2019b, 2017b).  There are three key concerns relating to the effectiveness of the CE concept. First, many proposals on the CE insufficiently reflect on thermodynamic constraints that limit the potential of recycling from 5-65  Total pages: 192Page 67
  both mass conservation and material quality perspectives or ignore the considerable amount of energy needed  so  reuse  materials  (Cullen  2017).  Second,  demand  for  materials  and  resources  will  likely outpace  efficiency  gains  in  supply  chains,  becoming  a  key  driver  of  GHG  emissions  and  other environmental  problems,  rendering  the  CE  alone  an  insufficient  strategy  to  reduce  emissions (Bengtsson  et  al.  2018).  In  fact,  the  empirical  literature  points  out  that  only  6.5%  of  all  processed materials (4 Gt yr-1) globally originate from recycled sources  (Haas et al. 2015). The low degree of circularity is explained by the high proportion of processed materials (44%) used to provide energy thus not available for recycling; and the high rate of net additions to stocks of 17 Gt yr1. As long as long-lived material stocks (e.g., in buildings and infrastructure) continue to grow, strategies targeting end-of-pipe materials cannot keep pace with primary materials demand (Krausmann et al. 2017; Haas et al. 2020).  Instead, a significant reduction of societal stock growth, and decisive eco-design is suggested to  advance  the  CE  (Haas  et  al.  2015).  Third,  cost-effectiveness  underlying  CE  activities  may concurrently  also  increase  energy  intensity  and  reduce  labour  intensity,  causing  systematically undesirable effects. To a large extent, the distribution of costs and beneﬁts of material and energy use depends on institutions in order to include demand-side solutions. Thus, institutional conditions have an essential role to play in setting rules differentiating profitable from nonprofitable activities in CE (Moreau  et  al.  2017).    Moreover,  the  prevalence  CE  practices  such  as  reuse,  refurbishment,  and recycling  can  differ  substantially  between  developed  and  developing  economies,  leading  to  highly context-specific mitigation potentials and policy approaches (McDowall et al. 2017). One report estimates that the CE can contribute to more than 6 GtCO2 emission reductions in 2030, including  strategies  such  as  material  substitution  in  buildings  (Blok  et  al.  2016).  Reform  of  the  tax system towards GHG emissions and the extraction of raw materials substituting taxes on labour is key precondition to achieve such a potential. Otherwise rebound effects tends to take back a high share of marginal  CE  efforts.  A  50%  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  in  industrial  processes,  including  the production of goods in steel, cement, plastic, paper, and aluminium from 2010 until 2050 are impossible to attain only with reuse and radical product innovation strategies, but will need to also rely on the reduction of primary input (Allwood et al. 2010).  5-66  Total pages: 192Page 68
  (consequential) analysis is required to avoid the risk that scaling effects negate efficiency gains; such analysis  is  however  rarely  applied  to  date.  For  example,  material  substitution  or  refurbishment  of buildings brings risk of increasing emissions despite improving or avoiding current materials (Eberhardt et al. 2019; Castro and Pasanen 2019) Besides, CE concepts that extend the lifetime of products and increase the fraction of recycling are useful but are both thermodynamically limited and will remain relatively small in scale as long as demand of primary materials continue to grow, and scale effects dominate. In spite of presenting a large body of literature on CE in general, only a small but growing body of literature exists on the net effects of its strategies from a  quantitative perspective, with key knowledge gaps remaining on specific CE strategies. There is  medium evidence that CE can reduce overall  emissions,  energy  use,  and  activity  levels,  with  medium  evidence  that  sharing  economy  can reduce  overall  emissions,  energy  use,  and  activity  levels,  with  medium  agreement  on  the  scale  of potential savings. 5.4Transition toward high well-being and low-carbon demand societies  Demand-side mitigation  involves  individuals (e.g.  consumption  choices),  culture  (e.g.  social  norms, values), corporate (e.g. investments), institutions (e.g. political agency), and infrastructure change (high evidence, high agreement). These five drivers of human behaviour either contribute to the status-quo of a global high-carbon, consumption, and GDP growth oriented economy or help generate the desired change  to  a  low-carbon  energy-services,  well-being,  and  equity  oriented  economy  (Jackson  2017; Cassiers et al. 2018; Yuana et al. 2020)(Figure 5.14). Each driver has novel implications for the design and implementation of demand-side mitigation policies. They show important synergies, making energy demand mitigation a dynamic problem where the packaging and/or sequencing of different policies play a  role  in  their  effectiveness,  demonstrated  in  Sections  5.5  and  5.6.  The  Social  Science  Primer (Supplementary  Material  I  Chapter  5)  describes  theory  and  empirical  insights  about  the  interplay between individual agency, the social and physical context of demand-side decisions in the form of social roles and norms, infrastructure and technological constraints and affordances, and other formal and informal institutions. Incremental interventions on all five fronts change social practices, effecting simultaneously energy and well-being (Schot and Kanger 2018). Transformative change will require coordinated use of all five drivers, as described in Figure 5.14 and Table 5. using novel insights about behaviour change for policy design and implementation (high evidence, high agreement). In particular, socio-economic  factors,  such  as  equity,  public  service  quality,  electricity  access  and  democracy  are found to be highly significant in enabling need satisfaction at low energy use, whereas economic growth beyond  moderate  incomes  and  extractive  economic  activities  are  observed  to  be  prohibiting  factors (Vogel et al. 2021). 5-67  Total pages: 192Page 69
  Figure 5.14 Role of people, demand-side action and consumption in reversing a planetary trajectory to a warming Earth towards effective climate change mitigation and dignified living standards for all 5.4.1Behavioural Drivers   Behaviour change by individuals and households requires both motivation to change and capacity for change (option availability/knowledge; material/cognitive resources to initiate and maintain change) (Moser and Ekstrom 2010; Michie et al. 2011) and is best seen as part of more encompassing collective action. Motivation for change for collective good comes from economic, legal, social incentives, regard for deeper intrinsic value of concern for others over extrinsic values. Capacity for change varies; people in  informal  settlements  or  rural  areas  are  incapacitated  by  socio-political  realities  and  have  limited access to new energy-service options.As  individuals pursue a  broad  set  of  goals and use  calculation-,  emotion-,  and rule-based  processes when they make energy decisions, demand-side policies can use a broad range of  behavioural tools that complement subsidies, taxes, and regulations (Chakravarty and Roy 2016; Mattauch et al. 2016; Niamir 2019) (high evidence, high agreement). The provision of targeted information, social advertisements, and influence of trusted in-group members and/role models or admired role models like celebrities can be used to create better climate change knowledge and awareness (Niamir et al. 2020c,b; Niamir 2019). Behavioural interventions like communicating changes in social norms can accelerate behaviour change by creating tipping points (Nyborg et al. 2016). When changes in energy-demand decisions (such as switching to a plant-based diet, Box 5.5) are motivated by the creation and activation of a social identity consistent with this and other behaviours, positive spillover can accelerate  behaviour change (Truelove et  al.  2014), both  within  a  domain or  across settings,  e.g., from  work  to  home  (Maki  and  Rothman 2017).  5-68  Total pages: 192Page 70
  START BOX 5.5 HERE Box 5.5 Dietary shifts in UK society towards lower emission foods Meat eating is declining in the UK, alongside a shift from carbon-intensive red meat towards poultry. This  is  due  to  the  interaction  of  behavioural,  socio-cultural  and  organisational  drivers  (Vinnari  and Vinnari 2014). Reduced meat consumption is primarily driven by issues of personal health and animal welfare, instead of climate or environment concerns (Latvala et al. 2012; Dibb and Fitzpatrick 2014; Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; Graça et al. 2019). Social movements have promoted shifts to a vegan diet (Morris et al. 2014; Laestadius et al. 2016) yet their impact on actual behaviour is the subject of debate (Taufik et al. 2019; Harguess et al. 2020; Sahakian et al. 2020). Companies have expanded new markets in  non-meat  products  (MINTEL  2019).  Both  corporate  food  actors  and  new  entrants  offering  more innovative  ‘meat  alternatives’  view  consumer  preferences  as  an  economic  opportunity,  and  are responding by increasing the availability of meat replacement products. No significant policy change has taken place in the UK to enable dietary shift (Wellesley and Froggatt 2015); however the Committee on  Climate  Change  has  recommended  dietary  shift  in  the  Sixth  Carbon  Budget(Climate  Change Committee 2020), involving reduced consumption of high-carbon meat and dairy products by 20% by 2030, with further reductions in later years in  order to reach net zero by 2050. Agricultural policies serve to support meat production with large subsidies that lower production cost and effectively increase the meat intensity of diets at a population level (Simon 2003; Godfray et al. 2018). Deeper, population wide reductions in meat consumption are hampered by these lock-in mechanisms which continue to stabilise  the  existing  meat  production-consumption  system.  The  extent  to  which  policymakers  are willing to actively stimulate reduced meat consumption thus remains an open question (Godfray et al. 2018).

Education and income increase Shift and Improve behaviour, whereas personal norms help to increase the more difficult Avoid behaviours (Mills and Schleich  2012).  Sociodemographic  variables  (household  size  and  income)  predict  energy  use,  but psychological  variables  (perceived  behavioural  control,  perceived  responsibility)  predict  changes  in energy  use;    younger  households  are  more  likely  to  adopt  Improve  decisions,  whereas  education increases Avoid decisions (Ahmad et al. 2015). In India and developing countries, Avoid decisions are made  by    individuals  championing  a  cause,  while  Improve  and  Shift  behaviour  are  increases  by awareness programmes and promotional materials highlighting environmental and financial benefits (Roy et al. 2018a; Chakravarty and Roy 2016). Cleaner cookstove adoption (see Box 5.6), a widely studied Improve solution in developing countries (Nepal et al. 2010; Pant et al. 2014), goes up with income, education, and urban location. Female education and investments into reproductive health are evident measures to reducing world population growth (Abel et al. 2016).  START BOX 5.6 HERE END BOX 5.6 HERE There  is  high  agreement  in  the  literaturethat  the  updating  of  educational  systems  from  a commercialised, individualised, entrepreneurial training model to an education cognizant of planetary health and human well-being can accelerate climate change awareness and action  (Mendoza and Roa 2014; Dombrowski et al. 2016) (also see Supplementary Material Chapter 5). There is high evidence and high agreement that people’s core values affect climate-related decisions and climate policy support by shaping beliefs and identities (Dietz 2014; Steg 2016; Hayward and Roy 2019). People with altruistic and biospheric values are more likely to act on climate change and support Total pages: 1925-70  Page 72
  climate policies than those with hedonic or egoistic values (Taylor et al. 2014), because these values are associated with higher awareness and concern about climate change, stronger belief that personal actions can help mitigating climate change, and stronger feelings of responsibility for taking climate action (Dietz 2014; Steg 2016). Research also suggest that egalitarian, individualistic, and hierarchical worldviews (Wildavsky and Dake 1990) have their role, and that successful solutions require policy makers of all three worldviews to come together and communicate with each other (Chuang et al. 2020).  Core values also influence which costs and benefits are considered (Hahnel et al. 2015; Gölz and Hahnel 2016; Steg 2016). Information provision and appeals are thus more effective when tailored to those values  (Bolderdijk  et  al.  2013;  Boomsma  and  Steg  2014),  as  implemented  by  the  energy-cultures framework (Stephenson et al. 2015; Klaniecki et al. 2020). Awareness, personal norms, and perceived behavioural  control  predict  willingness  to  change  energy-related  behaviour  above  and  beyond traditional sociodemographic and economic predictors (Schwartz 1977; Ajzen 1985; Stern 2000), as do perceptions of self-efficacy (Bostrom et al. 2019). However, such motivation for change  is often not enough,  as  actors  also  need  capacity  for  change  and  help  to  overcome  individual,  institutional  and market barriers  (Young et al. 2010; Carrington et al. 2014; Bray et al. 2011).   Choice architecture has been depicted as an anti-democratic attempt at manipulating the behaviour of actors without their awareness or approval (Gumbert 2019). Such critiques ignore the fact that there is no  neutral  way  to  present  energy-use  related  decisions,  as  every  presentation  format  and  choice 5-71  Total pages: 192Page 73
  environment influences choice, whether intentionally chosen or not. Educating households and policy makers about the effectiveness of choice architecture and adding these behavioural tools to existing market- and regulation-based tools in a transparent and consultative way can provide desired outcomes with increased effectiveness, while avoiding charges of manipulation or deception. People consent to  choice  architecture  tools  if  their  use  is  welfare-enhancing,  policymakers  are  transparent  about  their goals and  processes,  public  deliberation  and  participation  is  encouraged,  and the  choice  architect is trusted (Sunstein et al. 2019). 5-72  Total pages: 192Page 74

A review by Darby et al. (2006) finds direct feedback (from the meter or display monitor) is more effective than indirect feedback (via billing) (5 - 15% savings vs. 0 - 10% savings). Feedback effects (Cohen’s d= .241) are increased when combined with a monetary incentive (Cohen’s d=.96) and with a social comparison and a monetary incentive (Cohen’s d=.714) (Khanna et al. 2021) Sanguinetti et al. (2020) find that onboard feedback results in a 6.6% improvement in the fuel economy of cars (Cohen’s d: .07, [.05,.08]). 5-76  Total pages: 192Page 78
  The effectiveness of feedback from in home displays (IHDs) is highly studied. Two reviews find them to have a 2 - 14% energy saving (Ehrhardt-Martinez and Donnelly 2010; Faruqui et al. 2010). A meta-analysis by McKerracher and Torriti (2013)finds a smaller range of results, with 3 - 5% energy savings. Energy efficiency labeling has a heterogenous effect on investment in energy efficiency(Abrahamse et al. 2005; Andor and Fels 2018). Efficiency labels on houses lead to higher price mark ups (Jensen et al. 2016) and house prices (Brounen and Kok 2011). Energy star labels lead to significantly higher willingness to pay for refrigerators (Houde et al. 2013), but energy and water conservation varies by appliance from 0 - 23% (Kurz et al. 2005). A meta-analysis of interventions to increase alternative fuel vehicle adoption find a small effect (d=.20 - .28) (Pettifor et al. 2017). 5-77  Total pages: 192Page 79
  Make Behaviour Observable & Provide Recognition Making behaviour observable and recognition lead to 6-7% energy savings (Winett et al. 1978; Handgraaf et al. 2013; Nemati and Penn 2020) and a large effects size  (Cohen’s d = [.79,1.06); Nisa et al. 2019*). Community-wide interventions result in 17-27% energy savings  (Iweka et al. 2019). Neighborhood social influence has a small (d=.28) effect on alternative fuel vehicle adoption (Pettifor et al. 2017).  Communicate a Norm The effect of social norm information on household energy savings ranges from 1.7-11.5% (Delmas et al. 2013; Buckley 2020) and Cohen’s d from .08-.32,(Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Bergquist et al. 2019; Khanna et al. 2021); (Nisa et al. 2019)*, with similar effects on choice of mode of transportation. Pettifor et al. (2017) report a small effect (d=.20-.28) on selecting a more energy efficient car.  The Opower study (Allcott 2011), prototypical for the impact of social norms on household energy consumption, finds 2% reduction in long-term energy use and 11-20% energy reduction in the short run (Allcott 2011; Ayres et al. 2013; Costa and Kahn 2013; Allcott and Rogers 2014). Impact decays over time (Allcott and Rogers 2012). Norm interventions are less effective for low energy users (Schultz et al. 2007; Andor et al. 2017). Moral licensing and negative spillover can reduce the overall positive feedback of normative feedback (Tiefenbeck et al. 2013). Page 80
  Reframe Consequences in Terms People Care About Obtain a Commitment A meta-analysis by Khanna et al. (Khanna et al. 2021) finds a small and variable effect of motivational interventions that reframe consequences (Cohens’s d = [0,.423]); Effect are larger when reframing is combined with monetary incentives and feedback (d = .96). Darby et al. (2006) report 10-20% savings for US pay-as-you-go systems. Providing lifecycle cost information increases likelihood of purchasing eco-innovative products (Kaenzig and Wüstenhagen 2010).  Long term (10-year) operating cost information leads to higher WTP for energy efficiency compared to short term (1-year) cost information (Heinzle and Wüstenhagen 2012). Monetary information increases the success of energy reduction interventions (Newell and Siikamäki 2014; Andor and Fels 2018). Reframing interventions are more effective when combined with feedback (d = .24-.96) and with social comparisons and feedback (d = .42) (Khanna et al. 2021) Commitment and goal interventions result in significant energy reduction in half of studies(Abrahamse et al. 2005; Andor and Fels 2018); (Nisa et al. 2019)*. Nisa et al. (2019) report a moderate average effect (Cohen's d = 0.34, [.11, .66]). When results are significant, the energy savings are around 10% (Andor and Fels 2018). Self-set goals perform better than assigned goals (van Houwelingen and van Raaij 1989; McCalley and Midden 2002; Andor and Fels 2018) and reasonable goals perform better than unreasonably high or low goals (van Houwelingen and van Raaij 1989; Abrahamse et al. 2007; Harding and Hsiaw 2014). Interventions are more effective when the commitment is public (Pallak and Cummings 1976) and when combined with information and rewards (Slavin et al. 1981; Völlink and Meertens 1999). Note: The second column describes the effects of each of the eight behavioural tools. The third column plots the results of meta-analyses and reviews that focus on each tool. Effects are reported as described in the referenced paper, either as percentage of energy saved (dotted box) or by the effect size, measured as Cohen’s D (dashed box).   *Two responses to Nisa et al. (2019) challenge their conclusion that behavioural interventions have a small impact on household energy use (Stern 2020; van der Linden & Goldberg, 2020). We report the raw data collected and used in Nisa et al. (2019). Our data summary supports the arguments by Stern (2020) and van der Linden (2020) that interventions should be evaluated in combination, as well as individually, and that the results are highly sensitive to the chosen estimator.  a Range reported as 95% confidence interval of results used in the meta-analysis or review. b Range reported as all results included in the meta-analysis or review. c No range reported. d Range indicates the reported results within a meta-analysis; this applies when multiple intervention types in a meta-analysis are classified as a single behavioural tool.5-79  Total pages: 192At  a  broader  level,  narratives  about  climate  mitigation  circulate  within  and  across  societies,  as recognised  in  SR15,  and  are  broader  than  the  meanings  associated  with  specific  technologies  (high evidence, high agreement). Narratives enable people to imagine and make sense of the future through processes of interpretation, understanding, communication and social interaction  (Smith et al. 2017). Stories about climate change are relevant for mitigation in numerous ways. They can be  utopian or dystopian  (e.g.  The  great  derangement  by  Amitav  Ghosh)  (Ghosh  2016),  for  example  presenting apocalyptic  stories  and  imagery  to  capture  people’s  attention  and  evoke  emotional  and  behavioural response  (O’Neill  and  Smith  2014).  Reading  climate  stories  has  been  shown  to  cause  short-term influences  on  attitudes  towards  climate  change,  increasing  the  belief  that  climate  change  is  human caused and increasing its issue priority (Schneider-Mayerson et al. 2020). Climate narratives can also be  used  to  justify  scepticism  of  science,  drawing  together  coalitions  of  diverse  actors  into  social movements that aim to prevent climate action (Lejano and Nero 2020). Narratives have been used by indigenous communities to imagine climate futures divergent from top-down narratives (Streeby 2018). Narratives  are  also  used  in  integrated  assessment  and  energy  system  models  that  construct  climate stabilisation scenarios, for example in the choice of parameters, their interpretation and model structure  (Ellenbeck  and  Lilliestam  2019).  One  important  narrative  choice  of  many  models  involves  framing climate change as market failure (which leads to the result that carbon pricing is required). While such a choice can be justified, other model framings can be equally justified (Ellenbeck and Lilliestam 2019).  Power and agency shape which climate narratives are told and how prevalent they are  (O’Neill and Smith 2014; Schneider-Mayerson et al. 2020). For example, narratives have been used by indigenous communities to imagine climate futures divergent from top-down, government-led narratives (Streeby 2018). The uptake of new climate narratives is influenced by political beliefs and trust. Policy makers can  enable  emissions  reduction  by  employing  narratives  that  have  broad  societal  appeal,  encourage behavioural change  and complement regulatory  and fiscal measures  (Terzi  2020).  Justice  narratives may not have universal appeal - in a UK study, justice narratives polarised individuals along ideological lines, with lower support amongst individual with right-wing beliefs; by contrast, narratives centred on saving  energy,  avoiding  waste  and  patriotic  values  were  more  widely  supported  across  society 5-80  Total pages: 192(Whitmarsh  and  Corner  2017).  More  research  is  needed  to  assess  if  these  findings  are  prevalent  in diverse socio-cultural contexts, as well the role played by social media platforms to influence emerging narratives of climate change (Pearce et al. 2019).  Trust in organisations is a key predictor of the take-up of novel energy services (Lutzenhiser 1993), particularly when financial incentives are high (Stern et al. 1985; Joskow 1995). Research has shown that, if there is low public trust in utility companies, service delivery by community-based non-profit organisations in the US (Stern et al. 1985) or public/private partnerships in Mexico  (Friedmann and Sheinbaum  1998), offer  more effective  solutions,  yet  only  if  public trust  is  higher in these types  of organisations. UK research shows that acceptance of shifts to less-resource intensive service provision (e.g. more  resource  efficient  products,  extending  product  lifetimes,  community schemes for  sharing products)  varies  depending  on  factors  including  trust  in  suppliers  and  manufacturers,  affordability,  quality and hygiene of shared products, and fair allocation of responsibilities (Cherry et al. 2018). Trustin  other  people  plays  an  important  role  in  the  sharing  economy  (Li  and  Wang  2020),  for  example predicting shifts in transport mode, specifically car-sharing involving rides with strangers (Acheampong and Siiba 2019) (sharing economy see Section 5.3.4.2). Action on climate mitigation is influenced by our perception of what other people commonly do, think or expect, known as social norms (high evidence, high agreement) (Cialdini 2006) (see Table 5.3), even though people often do not acknowledge this (Nolan et al. 2008; Noppers et al. 2014). Changing social norms  can  encourage  societal  transformation  and  social  tipping  points  to  address  climate mitigation(Nyborg et al. 2016; Otto et al. 2020). Providing feedback to people about how their own actions compare to others can encourage mitigation (Delmas et al. 2013), although the overall effect size is not strong (Abrahamse and Steg 2013). Trending norms are behaviours that are becoming more popular, even if currently practised by a minority. Communicating messages that the number of people engaging in a mitigation behaviour (e.g. giving a financial donation to an environmental conservation organisation) is increasing – a simple low cost policy intervention - can encourage shifts to the targeted behaviour, even if the effect size is relatively small (Mortensen et al. 2019). Socially  comparative  feedback  seems  to  be  more  effective  when  people  strongly  identify  with  the reference group (De Dominicis et al. 2019). Descriptive norms (perceptions of behaviours common in others) are more strongly related to mitigation actions when injunctive norms (perceptions of whether certain  behaviours  are  commonly  approved  or  disapproved)  are  also  strong,  when  people  are  not strongly personally involved with mitigation topics (Göckeritz et al. 2010), when people are currently acting  inconsistently  with  their  preferences,  when  norm-based  interventions  are  supported  by  other interventions  and  when  the  context  supports  norm-congruent  actions  (Miller  and  Prentice  2016).  A descriptive norm prime (“most others try to reduce energy consumption”) together with injunctive norm feedback (“you are very good in saving energy”) is a very effective combination to motivate further energy savings (Bonan et al. 2020). Second-order beliefs (perceptions on what others in the community believe) are particularly important for leveraging descriptive norms (Jachimowicz et al. 2018). Behavioural contagion, which describes how ideas and behaviours often spread like infectious diseases, is a major contributor to the climate crisis (Sunstein 2019). But harnessing contagion can also mitigate warming. Carbon-heavy consumption patterns have become the norm only in part because we’re not charged for environmental damage we cause (Pigou 1920). The deeper source of these patterns has been peer influence (Frank 1999), because what we do influences others. A rooftop solar installation early in the adoption cycle, for example, spawns a copycat installation in the same neighbourhood within four months, on average. With such installations thus doubling every four months, a single new order results  in 32 additional installations in just two years. And contagion doesn’t stop there, since each family also influences friends and relatives in distant locations.  Harnessing contagion can also underwrite the investment necessary for climate stability. If taxed more heavily, top earners would spend less, shifting the frames of reference that shape spending of those just below, and so on—each step simultaneously reducing emissions and liberating resources for additional green investment (Frank 2020). Many resist, believing that higher taxes would make it harder to buy life’s special extras. But that belief is a cognitive illusion (Frank 2020). Acquiring special things, which are inherently in short supply, requires outbidding others who also want them. When top tax rates rise in tandem, relative bidding power is completely unchanged, so the same penthouse apartments would end up in the same hands as before. More generally, behavioural contagion is important to leverage all relevant social tipping points for stabilising Earth’s climate (Otto et al. 2020).  For new climate policies and mitigation technologies to be rapidly and extensively implemented, they must  be  socially  acceptable  to  those  who  are  directly  impacted  by  those  policies  and  technologies (medium evidence, high agreement). Policies that run counter to social norms or cultural meanings are less likely to be effective in reducing emissions (Demski et al. 2015; Perlaviciute et al. 2018; Roy et al. 2018b). More  just and  acceptable implementation  of renewable energy technologies requires taking account of the cultural meanings, emotional attachments and identities linked to particular landscapes and places where those technologies are proposed (Devine-Wright 2009) and enabling fairness in how decisions are taken and costs and benefits distributed (Wolsink 2007). This is important for achieving the  goal  of  SDG7  (i.e.  increased  use  of  renewable  energy  resources)  in  deveolping  countries  while achieving energy justice (Calzadilla and Mauger 2017). ‘Top-down’ imposition of climate policies by governments can translate into local opposition when perceived to be unjust and lacking transparency (high  evidence,  high  agreement).  Policy  makers  can  build  trust  and  increase  the  legitimacy  of  new policies by implementing early and extensive public and stakeholder participation, avoiding ‘NIMBY’ (Not In My Back Yard) assumptions about objectors and adopting ‘Just Transition’ principles (Owens 2000; Wolsink 2007; Wüstenhagen et al. 2007; Dietz and Stern 2008; Devine-Wright 2011; Heffron and McCauley 2018). Participatory mechanisms that enable deliberation  by a representative sample of the public (Climate Assembly UK 2020) can inform policy making and increase the legitimacy of new and difficult policy actions (Dryzek et al. 2019).  Collective action by civil society groups and social movements can work to enable or constrain climate mitigation.  Civil  society  groups  can  advocate  policy  change,  provide  policy  research  and  open  up opportunities for new political reforms (high evidence, high agreement) as recognised in previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2007).  Grassroots environmental initiatives, including community energy groups, are collective  responses  to,  and  critiques  of,  normative  ways  that  everyday  material  needs  (e.g.  food, energy, making) are produced, supplied and circulated (Schlosberg and Coles 2016). Such initiatives can reconcile lower carbon footprints with higher life satisfaction and higher incomes(Vita et al. 2020). Local initiatives such as Transition Towns and community energy can lead to improvements in energy efficiency, ensure a decent standard of living and increase renewable energy uptake, while building on existing social trust, and in turn, building social trust and initiating engagement, capacity building, and social capital formation(Hicks and Ison 2018). Another example are grassroot initiatives that aim to reduce food loss and waste, even as overall evidence on their effectiveness remains limited (Mariam et al. 2020).  However, community energy initiatives are not always inclusive and require policy support for widespread implementation across all socio-economic groups (Aiken et al. 2017) In addition, more evidence is required of the impacts of community energy initiatives (Creamer et al. 2018; Bardsley et al. 2019). Page 84
  Civil society social movements are a primary driver of social and institutional change (high evidence, high agreement) and can be differently positioned as, on the one hand, ‘insider’ social movements (e.g. World Wildlife Fund) that seek to influence existing state institutions through lobbying, advice and research and, on the other hand, ‘outsider’ social movements (e.g. Rising Tide, Extinction Rebellion) that advocate radical reform through protests and demonstrations(Newell 2005; Caniglia et al. 2015). Civil  society  social  movements  frame  grievances  that  resonate  with  society,  mobilise  resources  to coordinate and sustain mass collective action, and operate within  – and seek to influence  - external conditions  that  enable  or  constrain  political  change  (Caniglia  et  al.  2015).  When  successful,  social movements open up windows of opportunity (so called ‘Overton Windows’) to unlock structural change (high evidence, high agreement) (Szałek 2013; Piggot 2018).  Climate  social  movements  advocate  new  narratives  or  framings  for  climate  mitigation  (e.g.  climate ‘emergency’) (della Porta and Parks 2014); criticise positive meanings associated with high emission technologies or practices (see Diet and Solar PV Case Studies, Box 5.5 and 5.7); show disapproval for high  emission  behaviours  (e.g.  through  ‘flight  shaming’);  model  behaviour  change  (e.g.  shifting  to veganism or public transport – see Case Study on Mobility in Kolkata, Box 5.8); demonstrate against extraction and use of fossil-fuels(Cheon and Urpelainen 2018); and aim to increase a sense of agency amongst certain social groups (e.g. young people or indigenous communities) that structural change is possible. Climate strikes have become internationally prevalent, for example the September 2019 strikes involved participants in more than 180 countries (Rosane 2019; Fisher and Nasrin 2020; Martiskainen et al. 2020). Enabled by digitalisation, these have given voice to youth on climate (Lee et al. 2020) and created a new cohort of active citizens engaged in climate demonstrations (Fisher 2019). Research on bystanders shows that marches increase positive beliefs about marchers and collective efficacy (Swim et al. 2019). Countermovement coalitions work to oppose climate mitigation (high confidence). Examples include efforts in the US to oppose mandatory limits on carbon emissions supported by organisations from the coal and electrical utility sectors (Brulle 2019) and evidence that US opposition to climate action by carbon-connected industries  is  broad-based,  highly  organized,  and  matched  with  extensive  lobbying (Cory et al., 2021). Social movements can also work to prevent policy changes, for example in France the Gilet Jaunes objected to increases in fuel costs on the grounds that they unfairly distributed the costs and benefits of price rises across social groups, for example between urban, peri-urban and rural areas (Copland 2019). Religion could play an important role in enabling collective action on climate mitigation by providing cultural interpretations of change and institutional responses that provide resources and infrastructure to sustain collective actions (Roy et al. 2012; Haluza-DeLay 2014; Caniglia et al. 2015; Hulme 2015). Religion  can  be  an  important  cultural  resource  towards  sustainability  at  individual,  community  and institutional levels(Ives and Kidwell 2019) , providing leverage points for inner transformation towards sustainability (Woiwode et al. 2021). Normative interpretations of climate change for and from religious communities are found in nearly every geography, and often observe popular movements for climate action drawing on religious symbols or metaphors  (Jenkins et al. 2018). This suggests the value for policy makers of involving religious constituencies as significant civil society organisations in devising and delivering climate response.  Page 85
  As an innovative technology, solar PV was strongly taken up by consumers (Nemet 2019). Several key factors explain its success. First, modular design made it applicable to different scales of deployment in different geographical contexts (e.g. large-scale grid-connected projects and smaller-scale off-grid projects) and allowed its application by companies taking advantage of emerging markets (Shum and Watanabe 2009). Second, culturally, solar PV symbolised an environmentally progressive technology that was valued by users (Morris and Jungjohann 2016). Large-scale adoption led to policy change (i.e. the introduction of feed-in tariffs that guaranteed a financial return) that in turn enabled improvements to the technology by companies. Over time, this has driven large-scale reductions in cost and increase in deployment worldwide. The relative importance of drivers varied across contexts. In Japan, state subsidies were lower yet did not hinder take-up because consumer behaviour was motivated by non-cost symbolic aspects. In Germany, policy change arose from social movements that campaigned for environmental  conservation  and  opposed  nuclear  power,  making  solar  PV  policies  politically acceptable. In summary, the seven-decade evolution of solar PV shows an evolution in which the agency of consumers has consistently played a key role in multiple countries, such that deriving 30-50% of global electricity supply from solar is now a realistic possibility (Creutzig et al. 2017).

END BOX 5.7 HERE 5.4.3Business and Corporate Drivers  Businesses and corporate organisations play a key role in the mitigation of global warming, through their own commitments to zero-carbon footprints (Mendiluce 2021) decisions to invest in researching and  implementing  new  energy  technologies  and  energy  efficient  measures,  and  the  supply  side interaction with changing consumer preferences and behaviours, e.g. via marketing. Business models and strategies work both as a barrier to and as accelerator of decarbonisation. Still existing lock-in in infrastructures and business models advantages fossil fuel industry over renewable and energy efficient end use industry (Klitkou et al. 2015). The fossil fuel energy generation and delivery system therefore epitomises  a  barrier  to  the  acceptance  and  implementation  of  new  and  cleaner  renewable  energy technologies  (Kariuki  2018).  A  good  number  of  corporate  agents  have  attempted  to  derail  climate change  mitigation  by  targeted  lobbying  and  doubt-inducing  media  strategies  (Oreskes  and  Conway 2011). A number of corporations that are involved in the supply chain of both upstream and downstream of fossil fuel companies, make up the majority of organizations opposed to climate action (Dunlap and McCright 2015; Cory et al. 2021; Brulle 2019).  Corporate advertisement and brand building strategies also  attempt  to  deflect  corporate  responsibility  to  individuals,  and/or  to  appropriate  climate  care sentiments in their own brand building; climate change mitigation is uniquely framed through choice of products and consumption, avoiding the notion of the political collective action sphere (Doyle 2011; Doyle et al. 2019). Business and corporations are also agents of change towards decarbonisation, as demonstrated in the case  of  PV  and  battery  electric  cars  (Teece  2018).  Beyond  new  low-carbon  technologies,  strong sustainability  business  models  (SSBM)  are  characterised  by  identifying  nature  as  the  primary stakeholder,  strong  local  anchorage,  the  creation  of  diversified  income  sources,  and  deliberate limitations on economic growth (Brozovic 2019). However, SSBM are difficult to maintain if generally traditional business models prevail, requiring short-term accounting.  Page 86
  to incur losses due to liability risks. The divestment movement adds additional pressure on fossil fuel related investments (Braungardt et al. 2019), even though fossil fuel financing remains resilient (Curran 2020).  Companies,  businesses  and  organisations might  face liability  claims  for  their  contribution to changes especially in the carbon intensive energy sector. A late transition to a low-carbon economy would exacerbate the physical costs of climate change on governments, businesses and corporations (ESRB 2016). Despite these seemingly positive roles that Businesses and corporate organisations tend to play towards sustainable transitions, there is a need to highlight the dynamic relationship between sustainable and unsustainable trends (Antal et al. 2020). For example, the production of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) in the automobile market at the same time that car manufacturers are producing electric vehicles. An analysis  of  the  role  of  consumers  as  drivers  of  unsustainability  for  Businesses  and  Corporate organisations is very important here as this trend will offset the sustainability progress being made by these businesses and organisations (Antal et al. 2020). Professional  actors,  such  as  building  managers,  landlords,  energy  efficiency  advisers,  technology installers  and  car  dealers,  influence  patterns  of  mobility  and  energy  consumption  (Shove  2003)  by acting  as  ‘middle  actors’  (Janda  and  Parag  2013;  Parag  and  Janda  2014)  or  ‘intermediaries’  in  the provision of building or mobility services (Grandclément et al. 2015; De Rubens et al. 2018). Middle actors can bring about change in several different directions be it, upstream, or downstream or sideways. They can redefine professional ethics around sustainability issues, and as influencers on the process of diffusion of innovations (Rogers 2003), professionals can enable or obstruct improvements in efficient service provision or shifts towards low-carbon technologies (LCTs) (e.g. air and ground source heat pumps, solar hot water, underfloor heating, programmable thermostats, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery) and mobility (e.g. electric vehicles) technologies. 5.4.4Institutional Drivers The  allocation  of  political  power  to  incumbent  actors  and  coalitions  has  contributed  to  lock-in  of particular  institutions,  stabilising  the  interests  of  incumbents  through  networks  that  include policymakers,  bureaucracies,  advocacy  groups  and  knowledge  institutions  (high  agreement,  high evidence).  There  is  high  evidence  and  high  agreement  in  that  institutions  are  central  in  addressing climate  change  mitigation.  Indeed,  social  provisioning  contexts  including  equity,  democracy, public services and high quality infrastructure are found to facilitate high levels of need satisfaction at lower energy  use,  whereas  economic  growth  beyond  moderate  incomes  and  dependence  on  extractive industries inhibit it  (Vogel et al. 2021). They shape and interact with technological systems  (Unruh 2000; Foxon et al. 2004; Seto et al. 2014) and represent rules, norms and conventions that organise and structure  actions  (Vatn  2015)  and  help  create  new  path  dependency  or  strengthen  existing  path dependency (Mattioli et al. 2020) (also see case studies in Box 5.5-5.8 and Supplementary Material Chapter 5). These drive behaviour of actors through formal (e.g., laws, regulations, and standards) or informal  (e.g.,  norms,  habits,  and  customs)  processes,  and  can  create  constraints  on  policy  options (Breukers  and  Wolsink  2007).  For  example,  ‘the  car  dependent  transport  system’  is  maintained  by interlocking elements and institutions, consisting of i) the automotive industry; ii) the provision of car infrastructure;  iii)  the  political  economy  of  urban  sprawl;  iv)  the  provision  of  public  transport;  v) cultures  of  car  consumption  (Mattioli  et  al.  2020).    The  behaviour  of  actors,  their  processes  and implications on policy options and decisions is discussed further in Section 5.6.  5-85  Total pages: 192Page 87
  In densely populated, fast-growing megacities, policy makers face the difficult challenge of preventing widespread adoption of petrol or diesel fuelled private cars as a mode of transport. The megacity of Kolkata  in  India  provides  a  useful  case  study.  As  many  as  twelve  different  modes  of  public transportation, each with its own system structure, actors and meanings co-exist and offers means of mobility  to  its  14  million  citizens.  Most  of  the  public  transport  modes  are  shared  mobility  options ranging from sharing between two people in a rickshaw or between a few hundred in metro or sub-urban trains. Sharing also happens informally as daily commuters avail shared taxis and neighbours borrow each other’s car or bicycle for urgent or day trips. A key role is played by the state government, in collaboration with other stakeholders,to improve the system  as  whole  and  formalise  certain  semi-formal  modes  of  transport.  An  important  policy consideration has been to make Kolkata’s mobility system more efficient (in terms of speed, reliability and  avoidance  of  congestion)  and  sustainable  through  strengthening  coordination  between  different mode-based  regimes  (Ghosh  2019)  and  comfortable  with  airconditioned  space  in  a  hot  and  humid climate  (Roy  et  al.  2018b).  Policy  makers  have  introduced  multiple  technological,  behavioural  and socio-cultural measures to tackle this challenge. New buses have been purchased by public authorities (Ghosh and Schot 2019). These have been promoted to middle-class workers in terms of modernity, efficiency and comfort, and implemented using premium-fares. Digitalisation and the sharing economy has encouraged take-up of shared taxi rides (‘app cabs’), being low cost and fast, but also influenced by levels of social trust involved in rides with strangers (Acheampong and Siiba 2019; Ghosh and Schot 2019). Rickshaws have been improved through use of LNG and cycling has been banned from busy roads. These measures contributed positively in bringing down the trend of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP to half in one decade within the Kolkata metropolitan area, with potential for further reduction (Colenbrander et al. 2016). However, social movements have opposed some changes due to concerns  about  social  equity,  since  many  of  the  new  policies  cater  to  middle  class  aspirations  and preferences, at the cost of low income and less privileged communities. To conclude, urban mobility transitions in Kolkata shows interconnected policy, institutional and socio-cultural  drivers  for  socio-technical  change.  Change  has  unfolded  in  complex  interactions  between multiple  actors,  sustainability  values  and  megatrends,  where  direct  causalities  are  hard  to  identify. However,  the  prominence  of  policy  actors  as  change-agents  is  clear  as  they  are  changing  multiple regimes  from  within.  The  state  government  initiated  infrastructural  change  in  public  bus  systems, coordinated with private and non-governmental actors such as auto-rickshaw operators, app-cab owners who  hold  crucial  agency  in  offering  public  transport  services  in  the  city.  The  latter  can  directly  be attributed  to  the  global  momentum  of  mobility-as-a-service  platforms,  at  the  intersection  of digitalisation and sharing economy trends. More thoughtful action at a policy level is required to sustain and coordinate the diversity of public transport modes through infrastructure design and reflecting on the  overall  directionality  of  change  (Schot  and  Steinmueller  2018;  Roy  et  al.  2018b).  See  more  in Supplementary Material Chapter 5, SM5.6.3. 5-86  Total pages: 192Page 88
  quality of the service delivery impacts directly the potential user uptake of low-carbon technologies. In the state of Himachal Pradesh of India, shift from LPG to electricity, with induction stove, has been successful due to the availability of stable and continuous electricity which has been difficult to achieve in any other Indian state (Banerjee et al. 2016). In contrast, in South Africa, where people who were using electricity earlier are now adopting LPG to diversify the energy source for cooking due to high electricity tariff and frequent blackouts (Kimemia and Annegarn 2016) (see Box 5.5 and Supplementary Material Chapter 5). From  a  welfare  point  of  view,  infrastructure  investments  are  not  constrained  by  revealed  or  stated preferences (high evidence, high agreement). Preferences change with social and physical environment, and infrastructure interventions can be justified by objective measures, such as public health and climate change mitigation, not only given preferences (high agreement, high evidence). Specifically, there is a case  for  more  investment  in  low-carbon  transport  infrastructure  than  assumed  in  environmental economics  as  it  induces  low-carbon  preferences  (Creutzig  et  al.  2016a;  Mattauch  et  al.  2018, 2016). Changes in infrastructure provision for active travel may contribute to uptake of more walking and cycling (Frank et al. 2019). These effects contribute to higher uptake of low-carbon travel options, albeit the magnitude of effects depends on design choices and context  (Goodman et al. 2013, 2014; Song et al. 2017; Javaid et al. 2020; Abraham et al. 2021). Infrastructure is thus not only required to make  low-carbon  travel  possible  but  can  also  be  a  pre-condition  for  the  formation  of  low-carbon mobility preferences (also see mobility case study in Box 5.7).  The dynamic interaction of habits and infrastructures also predict CO2-intensive choices. When people move from a city with good public transport to a car-dependent city, they are more likely to own fewer vehicles due to learned preferences for lower levels of car ownership (Weinberger and Goetzke 2010). When individuals moving to a new city with extensive public transport were given targeted material about public transport options, the modal share of public transport increased significantly (Bamberg et al. 2003). Similarly, an exogenous change to route choice in public transport makes commuters change their habitual routes (Larcom et al. 2017).

  When climate change is seen as distant, it is not feared.

Lack of social trust reduces willingness to shift behaviour (e.g. adopt car-sharing). Fear of social disapproval decreases willingness to adopt new behaviours.

Stable and continuous electricity supply fostering induction stoves. 5.5An integrative view on transitioning  5.5.1Demand-side transitions as multi-dimensional processes Several integrative frameworks including social practice theory (Røpke 2009; Shove and Walker 2014), the  energy  cultures  framework  (Stephenson  et  al.  2015;  Jürisoo  et  al.  2019)  and  socio-technical transitions  theory  (McMeekin  and  Southerton  2012;  Geels  et  al.  2017)  conceptualise  demand-side transitions  as  multi-dimensional  and  interacting  processes  (high  evidence,  high  agreement).  Social practice theory emphasises interactions between artefacts, competences, and cultural meanings (Røpke 2009; Shove and Walker 2014)(Shove and Walker 2014; Røpke 2009). The energy cultures framework highlights  feedbacks  between  materials,  norms,  and  behavioural  practices  (Stephenson  et  al.  2015; Jürisoo et al. 2019). Socio-technical transitions theory addresses interactions between technologies, user practices, cultural meanings, business, infrastructures, and public policies (McMeekin and Southerton 2012; Geels et al. 2017) and can thus accommodate the five drivers of change and stability discussed in Section 5.4. Section 5.4 shows with high evidence and high agreement that the relative influence of different drivers varies  between  demand-side  solutions.  The  deployment  of  ‘improve’  options  like  LEDs  and  clean cookstoves  mostly  involves  technological  change,  adoption  by  consumers  who  integrate  new technologies in their daily life practices (Smith et al. 1993; Sanderson and Simons 2014; Franceschini and  Alkemade  2016),  and  some  policy  change.  Changes  in  meanings  are  less  pertinent  for  those ‘improve’-options that are primarily about technological substitution. Other improve-options, like clean cookstoves, involve both technological substitution and changes in cultural meanings and traditions. Deployment of ‘shift’ options like enhanced public transport involves substantial behavioural change and transitions to new or expanded provisioning systems, which may include new technologies (buses, trams), infrastructures (light rail, dedicated bus lanes), institutions (operational licenses, performance contracts),  financial  arrangements,  and  new  organisations  (with  particular  responsibilities  and oversight)  (high  evidence,  high  agreement)  (Deng  and  Nelson  2011;  Turnheim  and  Geels  2019). Changes in cultural meanings can facilitate ‘shift’ options. Shifts towards low-meat diets, for instance, are motivated by costs and by beliefs about the undesirability of meat that relate more to issues like health, nutrition and animal welfare than climate change (De Boer et al. 2014; Mylan 2018). ‘Avoid’  options  that  reduce  service  levels  (e.g.  sufficiency  or  downshifting)  imply  very  substantial behavioural  and  cultural  changes  that  may  not  resonate  with  mainstream  consumers  (Dubois  et  al. 2019). Other ‘avoid’ options like tele-working also require changes in cultural meanings and beliefs (about the importance of supervision, coaching, social contacts, or office politics), as well as changes in  behaviour,  institutions,  business,  and  technology  (including  good  internet  connections  and  office space  at  home).  Because  these interconnected  changes  were  not  widespread,  tele-working  remained stuck  in  small  niches  and  did  not  diffuse  widely  before  the  COVID-19  crisis  (Hynes  2014,  2016; Belzunegui-Eraso and Erro-Garcés 2020; Stiles 2020). As preferences change, new infrastructures and social settings can also elicit new desirabilities associated with emerging low-energy demand service provisioning systems (see 5.4.5).  5-89  Total pages: 192Page 91
  Demand-side transitions involve interactions between radical social or technical innovations (such as the avoid, shift, improve options discussed in Section 5.3) and existing socio-technical systems, energy cultures,  and  social  practices  (high  evidence,  high  agreement)  (Stephenson  et  al.  2015;  Geels  et  al. 2017). Radical innovations such as tele-working, plant-based burgers, car sharing, vegetarianism, or electric vehicles initially emerge in small, peripheral niches (Kemp et al. 1998; Schot and Geels 2008), constituted  by  R&D  projects,  technological  demonstration  projects  (Borghei  and  Magnusson  2016; Rosenbloom et al. 2018b), local community initiatives or grassroots projects by environmental activists (Hargreaves  et  al.  2013a;  Hossain  2016).  Such  niches  offer  protection  from  mainstream  selection pressures  and  nurture  the  development  of  radical  innovations  (Smith  and  Raven  2012).  Many  low-carbon niche-innovations, such as those described in Section 5.3, face uphill struggles against existing socio-technical  systems,  energy  cultures,  and  social  practices  that  are  stabilised  by  multiple  lock-in mechanisms (high evidence, high agreement) (Klitkou et al. 2015; Seto et al. 2016; Clausen et al. 2017; Ivanova et al. 2018). Demand-side transitions therefore do not happen easily and involve interacting processes  and  struggles  on  the  behavioural,  socio-cultural,  institutional,  business  and  technological dimensions (Nikas et al. 2020) (see also Section 5.4).5.5.2Phases in transitions Transitions often take several decades, unfolding through several phases. Although there is variability across  innovations,  sectors,  and  countries,  the  transitions  literature  distinguishes  four  phases, characterised by generic core processes and challenges: 1) emergence, 2) early adaptation, 3) diffusion, 4) stabilisation (high confidence) (Rotmans et al. 2001; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16). These four phases do not imply that transitions are linear, teleological processes,  because  set-backs  or  reversals  may  occur  as  a  result  of  learning  processes,  conflicts,  or changing coalitions (very high confidence) (Geels and Raven 2006; Messner 2015;  Davidescu et al. 2018). There is also no guarantee that technological, social, or business model innovations progress beyond the first phase. In the second phase, social or technical innovations are appropriated or purchased by early adopters, which increases visibility and may provide a small but steady flow of financial resources (high evidence, high  agreement)  (Zimmerman  and  Zeitz  2002;  Dewald  and  Truffer  2011).  Learning  processes, knowledge  sharing  and  codification  activities  help  stabilise  the  innovation,  leading  to  best  practice guidelines, standards, and formalised knowledge (high evidence, high agreement)  (Raven et al. 2008; Borghei and Magnusson 2018). User innovation may lead to the articulation of new routines and social practices, often in tandem with the integration of new technologies into people’s daily lives (Nielsen et al. 2016; Schot et al. 2016). Radical innovations remain confined to niches in the second phase because adoption is limited to small, dedicated groups (Schot et al. 2016), innovations are expensive or do not 5-90  Total pages: 192Page 92
  appeal to wider groups, or because complementary infrastructure are missing (Markard and Hoffmann 2016). In the third phase, radical innovations diffuse into wider communities and mainstream markets. Typical drivers are performance improvements, cost reductions, widespread consumer interest, investments in infrastructure and complementary technologies, institutional support and strong cultural appeal (high evidence, high agreement)  (Wilson 2012; Markard and Hoffmann 2016; Raven et al. 2017; Malone et al. 2017; Kanger et al. 2019). The latter may be related to wider cultural shifts such as increased public attention to climate change and new framings like ‘climate emergency’ which gained traction before the Covid-19 pandemic (Bouman et al. 2020b). These concerns may not last, however, since public attention typically follows cycles (Downs 1972; Djerf-Pierre 2012).  This phase often involves multiple struggles: economic competition between low-carbon innovations and  existing  technologies  and  practices,  business  struggles  between  incumbents  and  new  entrants (Hockerts  and  Wüstenhagen  2010),  cultural  and  framing  struggles  in  public  opinion    arenas (Kammermann  and  Dermont  2018;  Rosenbloom  2018;  Hess  2019a),  and  political  struggles  over adjustments  in  policies  and  institutions,  which  shape  markets  and  innovations  (Meadowcroft  2011; Roberts and Geels 2019). The lock-in mechanisms of existing practices and systems tend to weaken in the third phase, either because competing innovations erode their economic viability, cultural legitimacy or institutional support (Turnheim and Geels 2012; Roberts 2017; Kuokkanen et al. 2018; Leipprand and Flachsland 2018) or because exogenous shocks and pressures disrupt the status quo  (Kungl and Geels 2018; Simpson 2019).  5.5.3Feasible rate of change  Transitional change is usually slow in the first and second transition phase, because experimentation, social  and  technological  learning,  and  stabilisation  processes  take  a  long  time,  often  decades,  and remain restricted to small niches (high confidence) (Wilson 2012; Bento 2013; Bento et al.  2018b). 5-91  Total pages: 192Page 93
  Transitional change accelerates in the third phase, as radical innovations diffuse from initial niches into mainstream  markets,  propelled  by  the  self-reinforcing  mechanisms,  discussed  above.  The  rate  of adoption  (diffusion)  of  new  practices,  processes,  artefacts,  and  behaviours  is  determined  by  a  wide range  of  factors  at  the  macro-  and  micro-scales,  which  have  been  identified  by  several  decades  of diffusion  research  in  multiple  disciplines  (for  comprehensive  reviews  see,  e.g.  (Mansfield  1968; Martino et al. 1978; Davis 1979; Mahajan et al. 1990; Ausubel 1991; Grubler 1991; Feder and Umali 1993; Bayus 1994; Comin and Hobijn 2003; Rogers 2003; Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004; Meade and Islam 2006; Peres et al. 2010)). Diffusion  rates  are  determined  by  two  broad  categories  of  variables,  those  intrinsic  to  the technology/product/practice  under  consideration  (typically  performance,  costs,  benefits),  and  those intrinsic to the adoption environment (e.g., socio-economic and market characteristics). Despite differences, the literature offers three robust conclusions on acceleration (high evidence, high agreement): First, size matters. Acceleration of transitions is more difficult for social, economic, or technological systems of larger size (in terms of number of users, financial investments, infrastructure, powerful  industries)  (Wilson  2009,  Wilson  2012).  Size  also  matters  at  the  level  of  the  systems component involved in a transition. Components with smaller unit-scale (“granular” and thus relatively cheap), such as light bulbs or household appliances,  turn over much faster (often within a decade) than large-scale, capital-intensive lumpy technologies and infrastructures (such as transport systems) where rates of change involve typically several decades, even up to a century (Grubler 1991; Leibowicz 2018). Also, the creation of entirely new systems (diffusion) takes longer time than replacements of existing technologies/practices (substitution) (Grübler et al. 1999); and late adopters tend to adopt faster than early pioneers (Wilson 2012; Grubler 1996). 5-92  Total pages: 192Page 94
  Second, complexity matters, which is often related to unit-scale (Ma et al. 2008). Acceleration is more difficult for options with higher degrees of complexity (e.g., carbon capture, transport and storage, or a hydrogen economy) representing higher technological and investment risks that can slow down change. Options with lower complexity are easier to accelerate because they involve less experimentation and debugging and require less adoption efforts and risk. Third, agency, structure and meaning can accelerate transitions. The creation and mobilisation of actor coalitions is widely seen as important for acceleration, especially if these involve actors with technical skills, financial resources and political capital (Kern and Rogge 2016; Hess 2019b; Roberts and Geels 2019).  Changes  in  policies  and  institutions  can  also  accelerate  transitions,  especially  if  these  create stable  and  attractive  financial  incentives  or  introduce  technology-forcing  standards  or  regulations (Brand et al. 2013; Kester et al. 2018; Roberts et al. 2018). Changes in meanings and cultural norms can  also  accelerate  transitions,  especially  when  they  affect  consumer  practices,  enhance  social acceptance,  and  create  legitimacy  for  stronger  policy  support  (Lounsbury  and  Glynn  2001;  Rogers 2003;  Buschmann  and  Oels  2019).  Adoption  of  most  advanced  practices  can  support  leapfrogging polluting technologies (Box 5.9).  START BOX 5.9 HERE Box 5.9 Is leapfrogging possible? The  concept  of  leapfrogging  emerged  in  development  economics  (Soete  1985),  energy  policy (Goldemberg 1991) and environmental regulation (Perkins 2003), which provides a first critical review of the concept), and refers to a development strategy that skips traditional and polluting development 5-93  Total pages: 192Page 95
  in favour of the most advanced concepts.  For instance, in rural areas without telephone landlines or electricity  access  (cables),  a  direct  shift  to  mobile  telephony  or  distributed,  locally-sourced  energy systems  is  promoted,  or  economic  development  policies  for  pre-industrial  economies  forego  the traditional  initial  emphasis  of  heavy  industry  industrialisation,  instead  of  focusing  on  services  like finance  or  tourism.  Often  leapfrogging  is  enabled  by  learning  and  innovation  externalities  where improved knowledge and technologies become available for late adopters at low costs. The literature highlights  many  cases  of  successful  leapfrogging  but  also  highlights  limitations  (for  a  review  see Watson  and  Sauter  (Watson  and  Sauter  2011);  with  example  case  studies  for  China  e.g.  Gallagher (Gallagher 2006) or Chen and Li-Hua (Chen and Li-Hua 2011); Mexico (Gallagher and Zarsky 2007); or Japan and Korea, e.g. Cho et al. (Cho et al. 1998). Increasingly the concept is being integrated into the literature of low-carbon development, including innovation and technology transfer policies (for a review see Pigato (Pigato et al. 2020)), highlighting in particular the importance of contextual factors of  successful  technology  transfer  and  leapfrogging  including:  domestic  absorptive capacity  and technological  capabilities  (Cirera  and  Maloney  2017); human capital,  skills,  and  relevant  technical know-how (Nelson and Phelps 1966); the size of the market (Keller 2004); greater openness to trade (Sachs and Warner 1995; Keller 2004); geographical proximity to investors and financing (Comin et al.  2012);  environmental  regulatory  proximity  (Dechezleprêtre  et  al.  2015);  and  stronger  protection of intellectual  property  rights  (Dechezleprêtre  et  al.  2013;  Dussaux  et  al.  2017).  The  existence  of  a technological  potential  for  leapfrogging  therefore  needs  to  be  considered  within  a  wider  context  of social, institutional, and economic factors that influence if leapfrogging potentials can be realised (high evidence, high agreement). There are also some contentious topics in the debate on accelerated low-carbon transitions. First, while acceleration is desirable to mitigate climate change, there is a risk that accelerating change too much may  short-cut  crucial  experimentation  and  social  and  technological  learning  in  “formative  phases” (Bento 2013; Bento et al. 2018b) and potentially lead to a pre-mature lock-in of solutions that later turn out to have negative impacts (Cowan 1990, 1991) (high evidence, medium agreement). Second, there is an ongoing debate about the most powerful leverage points and policies for speeding up change in social and technological systems.  Farmer et al. 2019 suggested “sensitive intervention points” for low-carbon transitions, but do not quantify the impacts on transformations. Grubler et al. 2018 proposed an end-user and efficiency-focused strategy to achieve rapid emission reductions and quantified their scenario with a leading IAM. However, discussion of the policy implications of such a strategy have only just started (Wilson et al. 2019a) suggesting an important area for future research. The  last  contentious  issue  is  if  policies  can/should  substitute  for  lack  of  economic/social  appeal  of change or for technological risks. Many large-scale supply-side climate mitigation options such as CCS or nuclear power involve high technological risks, critically depend on a stable carbon price, and are controversial in terms of social and environmental impacts (cf. the reviews in (Sovacool et al. 2014; Wilson et al. 2020a) and the comprehensive discussion in (Smith et al. 2016) (high evidence, medium agreement). There is continuing debate if and how policies could counterbalance these impacts in order to  accelerate  transitions  (Nordhaus  2019;  Lovins  2015).  Some  demand-side  options  like  large-scale public transport infrastructures such as “Hyperloop” (Decker et al. 2017) or concepts such as “Asian Super Grid” (maglev fast train coupled with superconducting electricity transmission networks) (AIGC 2017) may face similar challenges, which adds weight and robustness to those demand-side options that are more decentralised, granular in scale and provide potential tangible consumer benefits besides being low-carbon (like more efficient buildings and appliances, “soft” urban mobility options (walking and cycling), digitalisation, among others, cf. Grubler et al. 2018). 5-94  Total pages: 192Page 96
  A  robust  conclusion  from  this  review  is  that  there  are  no  generic  acceleration  policies  that  are independent  from  the  nature  of  what  changes,  by  whom  and  how.  Greater  contextualisation  and granularity in policy approaches is therefore important to address  the challenges of rapid transitions towards zero-carbon systems (high evidence, high agreement). 5.6Governance and policy  START BOX 5.10 HERE Box 5.10 The informal sector and climate mitigation The informal economy represents a large and growing portion of socio-economic activities (Charmes 2016;  Muchie  et  al.  2016;  Mbaye  and  Gueye  2018),  including  much  of  the  work  done  by  women worldwide. It accounts for an estimated 61% of global employment in the world; 90% in developing countries,  67%  in  emerging  countries,  and  18%  in  developed  countries  (Berik  2018),  representing roughly  30%  of  GDP  across  a  range  of  countries  (Durán  Heras  2012;  Narayan  2017).  Due  to  its importance,  policies  which  support  informal-sector  climate  mitigation  activities  may  be  extremely efficient  (Garland  and  Allison  M.  2015).  For  example,  environmental  and  energy  taxes  may  have negative gross costs when the informal sector dominates economic activity since these taxes indirectly tax  the  informal  sector;  informal  production  may  substitute  for  energy-intensive  goods,  with  strong welfare-enhancing effects (Bento et al. 2018a).  The informal sector can assemble social and financial capital,  create  jobs,  and  build  low-carbon  local  economies  (Ruzek  2015).  Constraints  on  small  and informal-sector  firms’  ability  to  build  climate  resilience  include  financial  and  data  barriers,  limited access to information technology, and policy exclusion (Kraemer-Mbula and Wunsch-Vincent 2016; Crick et al. 2018a,b). Informal-sector  innovation  is  often  underrated.  It  gives  marginalised  people  access  to  welfare-enhancing innovations, building on alternative knowledge and socially-embedded reciprocal exchange (Jaffe and Koster 2019; Sheikh 2019; Sheikh and Bhaduri 2020). Large improvements in low-emission, locally-appropriate  service  provision  are  possible  by  facilitating  informal-sector  service  providers’ 5-95  Total pages: 192Page 97
  access  to  low-energy  technologies  (while  taking  care  not  to  additionally  burden  the  unpaid  and marginalised),  through  such  means  as  education,  participatory  governance,  government  policies  to assist the informal sector, social services, healthcare, credit provision, and removing harmful policies and regulatory silos.  The importance of the informal economy, especially in low-income countries, opens many possibilities for new approaches to DLS service provision along with climate resilience (Rynikiewicz and Chetaille 2006; Backstränd et al. 2010; Porio 2011; Kriegler et al. 2014; Taylor and Peter  2014;  Brown  and  McGranahan  2016;  Chu  2016;  Boran  2019;  Hugo  and  du  Plessis  2019; Satterthwaite et al. 2018; Schröder et al. 2019; Javaid et al. 2020).   END BOX 5.10 HERE 5.6.2Policies to strengthen Avoid-Shift-Improve There is high untapped potential of demand-side mitigation options if considered holistically within the domains  of  avoid-shift-improve  (Sections  5.3  and  5.4;  Tables  5.1,  5.2,  5.3a,  and  5.3b).  Within  the demand-side  mitigation  options  opportunity  space,  policies  currently  focus  more  on  efficiency  and ‘improve’ options and relatively less on ‘shift’ and ‘avoid’ options (Dubois et al. 2019; Moberg et al. 2019).  Current demand side policies  are fragmented, piecemeal and too weak to drive demand-side transitions  commensurate with  1.5oC  or  2oC  climate goals  (Wilson  et  al.  2012; Fawcett et  al.  2019; Mundaca  et  al.  2019;  Moberg  et  al.  2019)  (high  evidence,  highagreement).  However,  increasingly policy mix in a number of countries has seen a rise in prohibitions on fossil fuel use as a way to weaken lock-ins, for example, in fossil fuel heating in favour of low carbon alternatives  (Rosenbloom et al. 2020).  Policies that are aimed at behaviour and lifestyle changes carry a perception of political risks for policy makers, which may explain why policy instruments focus more on information provision and adoption of incentives than on regulation and investment (Rosenow et al. 2017; Moberg et al. 2019). Acceleration of demand-side transitions would thus require both a broadening of demand-side options and the creation of comprehensive and targeted policy mixes (Kern et al. 2017; Rosenow et al. 2017; IPCC 2018) that strengthens five drivers of decision and action  identified in Section 5.4, Table 5. and in  the  tables  below  (high  evidence,  high  agreement).  Demand-side  transitions  in  developing  and emerging  economies  would  also  require  stronger  administrative  capacity  as  well  as  technical  and financial support (UN-Habitat 2013; Creutzig et al. 2016b). 5-96  Total pages: 192Page 98
  Systematic categorisation of demand-side policy options in different sectors and services through the avoid-shift-improve  (ASI)  framework  enables  identification  of  major  entry  points  and  possible associated social struggles to overcome for the policy instruments/interventions as discussed below.  Cities face pressing priorities like poverty reduction, meeting basic services and building human and institutional capacity. These are met with highly accessible walkable and cyclable cities, connected with public transit corridors, enabling equal accessibility for all citizens, and enabling a high level of service provisioning (UN-Habitat 2013; Creutzig et al. 2016b). Infrastructure development costs less than for car dependent cities. However, it requires a mindset shift for urban and transport planners (medium evidence, high agreement). Policies that support the avoidance of higher emission lifestyles and improve wellbeing are facilitated  by  the  introduction  of  smart  technologies,  infrastructures  and  practices  (Amini  et  al.  2019).  They include  regulations  and  measures  for  investment  in  high-quality  ICT  infrastructure,  regulations  to restrict number plates as well as company policy around flexible working conditions (Lachapelle et al. 2018; Shabanpour et al. 2018). Working-from-home arrangements may advantage certain segments of society  such  as  male,  older,  higher  educated  and  highly  paid  employees,  potentially  exacerbating existing inequalities in the labour market (Lambert et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021).  In the absence of distributive or other equity-based measures, the potential gains in terms of emissions reduction may therefore be counteracted by the cost of increasing inequality.  This potential growth in inequality is likely to be more severe in poorer countries that will additionally suffer from a lack of international funding  for  achieving  the  SDGs  (Barbier  and  Burgess  2020;  UN  2020)  (high  evidence,  medium agreement).

Temperature set point as norm; building energy codes that set building standards; bioclimatic or/and zero emissions; cities and  buildings  that incorporate features like daylighting and increased building depth, height, and compactness (Steemers 2003; Creutzig et al. 2016a).  Lower prices for public parking, and subsidies towards the purchase of electric vehicles providers of electric vehicle (EV) sharing services were given subsidies towards the purchase of electric vehicles (Jung and Koo 2018). 5.6.2.2Shift policies  As  indicated  in  Table  5.6,  ‘Shift’  policies  have  various  forms  such  as  the  demand  for  low  carbon materials  for  buildings  and  infrastructure  in  manufacturing  and  services  and  shift  from  meat-based protein, mainly beef, to plant-based diets of other protein sources  (Willett et al. 2019; Ritchie et al. 2018; Springmann et al. 2016a) (high evidence, high agreement). Governments also play a direct role beyond nudging citizens with information about health and wellbeing.  While the effectiveness of these policies on behaviour change overall may be limited (Pearson-Stuttard et al. 2017; Shangguan et al. 2019), there is some room for policy to influence actors upstream, i.e. industry and supermarkets which may give rise to longer-term, structural change.

Architectural design with shading and ventilation Lack of education, awareness and capacity for new thinking, local air pollution. Incentives for increased urban density and incentives to encourage architectural forms with lower surface-to-volume ratios and increased shading support (Creutzig et al. 2016a). Mobility  services  is  one  of  the  key  areas  where a  combination  of market-based  and  command-and-control  measures  have  been  implemented  to  persuade  large  numbers  of  people  to  get  out  of  their automobiles and take up public transport and cycling alternatives (Gehl et al. 2011). Congestion charges are often complemented by other measures such as company subsidies for bicycles to incentivise the shift  to  public  mobility  services.  Attracting  people  to  public  transport  requires  sufficient  spatial coverage  of  transport  with  adequate  level  of  provision,  and  good  quality  service  at  affordable  fares (Sims et al. 2014; Moberg et al. 2019) (high evidence, high agreement).  Cities such as Bogota, Buenos Aires and Santiago have seen rapid growth of cycling, resulting in an 6-fold of cyclists  (Pucher and Buehler 2017). Broadly, the history and type of city determines how quickly the transition to public modes of transport can be achieved.  For example, cities in developed countries enjoy an advantage in that network of high-quality public transport predating the advent of automobiles, whereas cities in less developed countries are latecomers in large-scale network infrastructure (Gota et al. 2019; UN-Habitat 2013). 5.6.2.3Improve policies ‘Improve’ policies focus on the efficiency and enhancement of technological performance of services (Table). In mobility services, ‘improve’ policies aim at improving vehicles, comfort, fuels, transport operations  and  management  technologies;  and  in  building,  they  include  policies  for  improving efficiency of heating systems and retrofitting existing buildings.  Efficiency improvements in electric cooking appliances, together with the ongoing decrease in prices of renewable energy technologies, is opening  policy  opportunities  to  support  households  to  adopt  electrical  cooking  at  mass  scale  (IEA 2017c;  Puzzolo  et  al.  2019)  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement).  These  actions  towards  cleaner energy  for  cooking  often  come  with  cooking-related  reduction  of  GHG  emissions,  even  though  the 5-99  Total pages: 192Lightweight vehicle, hydrogen car, electric vehicles, ecodriving Adequate infrastructure may be absent, speed a part of modern life.

Table  5.7  highlights  the  significant  progress  made  in  the  uptake  of  the  Electrical  Vehicle  (EV)  in Europe, driven by a suite of incentives and policies.  Increased activity in widening Electric Vehicle (EV)  use  is  also occurring  in  developing  countries. The  Indian  Government’s proposal to reach the target of a 100% electric vehicle fleet by 2030 has stimulated investment in charging infrastructure that can facilitate diffusion of larger EVs (Dhar et al. 2017).  Although the proposal was not converted into a policy, India's large and growing two-wheeler market has benefitted from the policy attention on EVs , showing a significant potential for increasing the share of electric two-and three-wheelers in the short-term (Ahmad and Creutzig 2019).  Similar opportunities exist for China where e-bikes have replaced car trips and are reported to act as intermediate links in multimodal mobility (Cherry et al. 2016). In recent years, policy interest has arisen to address the energy access challenge in Africa using low-carbon energy technologies to meet energy for poverty reduction and climate action simultaneously (Rolffs et al. 2015; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Mulugetta et al. 2019). This aspiration has been bolstered on the technical front by significant advances in appliance efficiency such as light-emitting diode (LED) technology, complemented by the sharp reduction in the cost of renewable energy technologies, and largely driven by market stimulating policies and public R&D to mitigate risks (Alstone et al. 2015; Zubi et al. 2019) (high evidence, high agreement).   5.6.3Policies in transition phases Demand-side  policies  tend  to  vary  for  different  transition  phases  (high  evidence,  high  agreement) (Sandin et al. 2019; Roberts and Geels 2019). In the first phase, which is characterised by the emergence or  introduction  of  radical  innovations  in  small  niches,  policies  focus  on:  a)  supporting  R&D  and demonstration  projects  to  enable  learning  and  capability  developments,  b)  nurturing the  building  of networks  and  multi-stakeholder  interactions,  and  c)  providing  future  orientation  through  visions  or targets (Brown et al. 2003; López-García et al. 2019; Roesler and Hassler 2019). In the second phase, the policy emphasis shifts towards upscaling of experiments, standardisation, cost reduction, and the creation of early market niches (Ruggiero et al. 2018; Borghei and Magnusson 2018). In the third and later phases, comprehensive policy mixes are used to stimulate mass adoption, infrastructure creation, social acceptance and business investment (Fichter and Clausen 2016; Strauch 2020; Geels et al. 2018). In  the  fourth  phases,  transitions  can  also  be  stimulated  through  policies  that  weaken  or  phase-out existing regimes such as removing inefficient  subsidies (for cheap petrol or fuel oil) that encourage wasteful  consumption,  increasing  taxes  on  carbon-intensive  products  and  practices  (Box  5.11),  or 5-101  Total pages: 192START BOX 5.11 HERE Box 5.11: Carbon pricing and fairness Whether  the  public  supports  specific  policy  instruments  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  is determined by cultural and political world views (Alberini et al. 2018; Cherry et al. 2017; Kotchen et al. 2017) and national position in international climate negotiations with major implications for policy design. For example, policy proposals need to circumvent "solution aversion": that is, individuals are more doubtful about the urgency of climate change mitigation if the proposed policy contradicts their political worldviews (Campbell and Kay 2014). While there are reasons to believe that carbon pricing is the most efficient way to reduce emissions, a recent literature – focusing on populations in Western Europe  and  North  America  and  carbon  taxes  –  documents  that  efficiency  feature  alone  is  not  what makes citizens like or dislike carbon pricing schemes  (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017; Klenert et al. 2018). Citizens  tend  to  ignore  or  doubt  the  idea  that  pricing  carbon  emissions  reduces  GHG  emissions (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Douenne and Fabre 2019; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019). Further, citizens have fairness concerns about carbon pricing (Büchs and Schnepf 2013; Douenne and Fabre 2019; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019), even if higher carbon prices can be made progressive by suitable use of revenues (Rausch et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2015; Klenert and Mattauch 2016). There are also non-economic properties of policy instruments that matter for public support: Calling a carbon price a "CO2 levy" alleviates solution aversion (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017). It may be that the word “tax” evokes a feeling of distrust in government  and may have high costs, low benefits and distributional effects (Strand 2020). Trust in politicians is negatively correlated with higher carbon prices (Hammar and Jagers 2006; Rafaty 2018) and political campaigns for a carbon tax can lower public support for them (Anderson et al. 2019). Few developing countries have adopted carbon taxes, probably due to high costs, relatively low benefits, and distributional effects (Strand 2020). To address these realities regarding support for carbon pricing, some studies have examined whether specific uses of the revenue can increase public support for higher carbon prices (Carattini et al. 2017; Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019). Doubt about the environmental effectiveness of carbon pricing may be alleviated if revenue from carbon pricing is earmarked for specific uses (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017) and higher carbon prices may then be supported (Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019).  This  is  especially  the  case for  using  the  proceeds  on  “green investment”  in  infrastructure  or energy efficiency programmes (Kotchen et al. 2017). Further, returning the revenues to individuals in a  salient  manner  may  increase  public  support  and  alleviate  fairness  proposals,  given  sufficient information  (Carattini  et  al.  2017;  Klenert  et  al.  2018).  Perceived  fairness  is  one  of  the  strongest predictors of policy support (Jagers et al. 2010; Whittle et al. 2019). END BOX 5.11 HERE 5.6.4Policy sequencing and packaging to strengthen enabling conditions Policy coordination is critical to manage infrastructure interdependence across sectors, and to avoid trade-off  effects  (Raven  and  Verbong  2007;  Hiteva  and  Watson  2019),  specifically  requiring  the consideration of interactions among supply-side and demand-side measures (Kivimaa and Virkamäki 2014; Rogge and Reichardt 2016; de Coninck et al. 2018; Edmondson et al. 2019) (high evidence, high agreement). For example, the amount of electricity required for cooking can overwhelm the grid which can lead to failure, causing end-users to shift back to traditional biomass or fossil fuels (Ateba et al. 2018; Israel-Akinbo et al. 2018); thus grid stability policies need to be undertaken in conjunction.  Policy makers operate in a politically dynamic national and international environment, and their policies often reflect their contextual situations and constraints with regards to climate-related reforms (Levin et al. 2012; Copland 2019), including differentiation between developed and developing countries(Beer and Beer 2014; Roy et al. 2018c)(high evidence, high agreement).Variables such as internal political stability,  equity,  informality  (Box  5.10),  macro-economic  conditions,  public  debt,  governance  of policies,  global  oil  prices,  quality  of  public  services,  and  the  maturity  of  green  technologies  play important roles in determining policy directions. Sequencing policies appropriately is a success factor for climate policy regimes (high evidence, high agreement). In most situations policy measures require a preparatory phase that prepares the ground by lowering the costs of policies,  communicating the costs and benefits to citizens, and building coalitions for policies, thus reducing political resistance (Meckling et al. 2017). This policy sequencing aims to incrementally relax or remove barriers over time to enable significant cumulative increases in policy stringency and  create coalitions that support future policy development  (Pahle et al. 2018). German policies  into  renewables  began  with  funding  for  RD&D,  then  subsidies  for  demonstration  projects during the 1970s and 1980s, and continued to larger-scale projects such as  ‘Solar Roofs’ programmes in the 1990s, including the scaled-up FITs for solar power (Jacobsson and Lauber 2006). These policies led to industrial expansion in wind and solar energy systems, giving rise to powerful renewables interest coalitions that defend existing measures and lend political support for further action.  Policy sequencing has also been deployed to introduce technology bans and strict performance standards with a view to eliminate  emissions  as  the  end  goal,  and may  the  involve simultaneous support  low  carbon  options while deliberately phasing out established technological regime (Rogge and Johnstone 2017).  As a key contending policy instrument, carbon pricing also requires embedding into policy packages (high evidence, medium agreement). Pricing may be regressive and perceived as additional costs by households  and  industry,  making  investments  into  green  infrastructure  politically  unfeasible,  as examples from France and Australia show (Copland 2019; Douenne and Fabre 2020).  Reforms that would push up household energy expenses are often left aside for fear of how citizens, especially the poor, would react or cope with higher bills (Martinez and Viegas 2017; Tesfamichael et al. 2021) (high evidence, medium agreement). This makes it important to precede carbon pricing with investments into renewable energy and low carbon transport modes (Biber et al. 2017; Tvinnereim and Mehling 2018), and  especially  support  developing  countries  by  building  up  low-carbon  energy  and  mobility infrastructures  and  technologies,  thus  reducing  resistance  to  carbon  pricing  (Creutzig  2019). Additionally, carbon pricing receives higher acceptance if fairness and distributive consideration are made explicit in revenue distribution (see Box 5.11).  The effectiveness of a policy package is determined by design decisions as well as the wider governance context that include the political environment, institutions for coordination across scales, bureaucratic traditions, and judicial functioning (Howlett and Rayner 2013; Rogge and Reichardt 2013; Rosenow et al. 2016) (high evidence, high agreement). Policy packages often emerge through interactions between different policy instruments as they operate in either complementary or contradictory ways, resulting from conflicting policy goals (Cunningham et al. 2013; Givoni et al. 2013). An example includes the acceleration in shift from traditional biomass to the adoption of modern cooking fuel for 80 million households  in  rural  India  over  a  very  short  period  of  4  years  (2016-2020),  which    employed  a comprehensive  ‘policy  package’ infrastructural  support  and strengthening  of  the supply chain to induce households to shift towards a clean cooking fuel from the  use of biomass (Kumar 2019). This was operationalised by creating a LPG supply chain by linking oil and gas companies with distributors to assure availability, create infrastructure for local storage along with  an  improvement  of  the  rural  road  network,    especially  in  the  rural  context  (Sankhyayan  and Dasgupta 2019). State governments initiated separate policies to increase the distributorship of LPG in their states (Kumar et al. 2016). Similarly, policy actions for scaling up electric vehicles need to be well designed  and  coordinated  where  EV  policy,  transport  policy  and  climate  policy  are  used  together, working  on  different  decision  points  and  different  aspects  of  human behaviour  (Barton  and  Schütte 2017). The coordination of the multiple policy actions enables co-evolution of multiple outcomes that involve  shifting  towards  renewable  energy  production,  improving  access  to  charging  infrastructure, carbon pricing and other GHG measures (Wolbertus et al. 2018).  Design of policy packages should consider not only policies that support low carbon transitions but also those that challenge existing carbon-intensive regimes, generating not just policy “winners” but also “losers” (Carley and Konisky 2020) (high evidence, high agreement).  The winners include low carbon innovators  and  entrepreneurs,  while  the  potential  losers  include  incumbents  with  vested  interests  in sustaining the status quo (Mundaca et al. 2018; Monasterolo and Raberto 2019). Low carbon policy packages would benefit from looking beyond climate benefits to include non-climate benefits such as health  benefits,  fuel  poverty  reductions  and  environmental  co-benefits  (Ürge-Vorsatz  et  al.  2014; Sovacool et al. 2020b). The uptake of decentralised energy services using solar PV in rural areas in developing countries is one such example where successful initiatives are linked to the convergence of multiple policies that include import tariffs, research incentives for R&D, job creation programmes, policies  to  widen  health  and  education  services,  and  strategies  for  increased  safety  for  women  and children (Kattumuri and Kruse 2019; Gebreslassie 2020).   The  energy  efficient lighting  transition in  Europe  represents  a  good  case  of  the formation  of  policy coalitions that led to the development of policy packages. As attention for energy efficiency in Europe increased  in  the  1990s,  policymakers  attempted  to  stimulate  energy-saving  lamp  diffusion  through voluntary  measures.    But  policies  stimulated  only  limited  adoption.  Consumers  perceived  CFLs  as giving ‘cold’ light, being unattractively shaped, taking too long to achieve full brightness, unsuitable for many fixtures, and unreliable (Wall and Crosbie 2009).  Still, innovations by major CFL and LED multinationals  continued.    Increasing  political  attention  to  climate  change  and  criticisms  from environmental  NGOs  (e.g.  WWF,  Greenpeace)  strengthened  awareness  about  the  inefficiency  of incandescent light bulbs (ILBs), which led to negative socio-cultural framings that associated ILBs with energy waste (Franceschini and Alkemade 2016).  The combined pressures from the lighting industry, NGOs and member states led the European Commission to introduce the 2009 ban of ILBs of more than 80W, progressing to lower-wattage bans in successive years.  While the ILB ban initially mainly boosted CFL diffusion, it also stimulated LED uptake. LED prices decreased quickly by more than 85% between 2008 and 2012 (Sanderson and Simons 2014), because of scale economies, standardisation and commoditisation of LED chip technology, and improved manufacturing techniques.  Because of further rapid developments to meet consumer tastes, LEDs came to be seen as the future of domestic lighting (Franceschini et al. 2018). Acknowledging these changing views, the 2016 and 2018 European bans on directional  and  non-directional  halogen  bulbs  explicitly  intended  to  further  accelerate  the  LED transition and reduce energy consumption for residential lighting.

  thinking and implementation that involves careful sequencing of policies as well as designing policy packages that address multiple co-benefits would be critical to manage interactions among supply-side and demand-side options to accelerate mitigation.  5.7Knowledge gaps Knowledge gap 1: Better metric to measure actual human well-being  Knowledge  on  climate  action  that  starts  with  the  social  practices  and  how  people  live  in  various environments,  cultures,  contexts  and  attempts  to  improve  their  well-being,  is  still  in  its  infancy.  In models,  climate  solutions  remain  supply-side  oriented,  and  evaluated  against  GDP,  without acknowledging the reduction in well-being due to climate impacts. GDP is a poor metric of human well-being, and climate policy evaluation requires better grounding in relation to decent living standards and or similar benchmarks. Actual solutions will invariably include demand, service provisioning and end use. Literature on how gender, informal economies mostly in developing countries, and solidarity and care  frameworks  translate  into  climate  action,  but  also  how  climate  action  can  improve  the  life  of marginalised groups remains scarce. The working of economic systems under a well-being driven rather than GDP driven paradigm requires better understanding. Knowledge gap 2: Evaluation of climate implication of the digital economy The  digital  economy,  as  well  as  shared  and  circular  economy,  is  emerging  as  template  for  great narratives, hopes and fears. Yet, there is few systematic evaluations of what is already happening and what can govern it towards a better narrative. Research needs to better gauge energy trends for rapidly evolving systems like data centres,  increased use of social media and influence of consumption and choices, AI, blockchain, implication of digital divide among social groups and countries on well-being. Governance decisions on AI, indirectly fostering either climate harming or climate mitigating activities remain  unexplored.  Better  integration  of  mitigation  models  and  consequential  life  cycle  analysis  is needed for assessing how digitalisation, shared economy and circular economy change material and energy demand. Knowledge gap 3: Scenario modelling of services Scenarios start within parameter-rich models carrying more than a decade-long legacy of supply side technologies that are not always gauged in recent technological developments. Service provisioning systems  are  not  explicitly  modelled,  and  diversity  in  concepts  and  patterns  of  lifestyles  rarely considered. A new class of flexible and modular models with focus on services and activities, based on variety of data sources including big data collected and compiled is needed. There is scope for more sensitivity analysis on two aspects to better guide further detailed studies on societal response to policy.  These  aspects  need  to  explore  which  socio-behavioural  aspects/  organisation  changes  has  biggest impact on energy/emissions reductions, and on the scale for take-back effects, due to interdependence on inclusion or exclusion of groups of people. Models mostly consider behavioural change free, and don’t  account  for  how  savings  due  to  “avoid”  measures  may  be  re-spent.  Most  quantitatively measurable service indicators e.g. pkm or tkm are also inadequate to measure services in the sense of well-being contributions. More research is needed on how to measure e.g. accessibility, social inclusion etc. Otherwise services will also be poorly represented in scenarios.  Page 107
  their  relative  importance  in  different  transition  phases;  (2)  how  narratives  associated  with  specific technologies, group identities, and climate change influence each other and interact over time to enable and constrain mitigation outcomes; (3) how social media influences the development and impacts of narratives about low carbon transitions; (4) the effects of social movements (for climate justice, youth climate  activism,  fossil  fuel  divestment,  and  climate  action  more  generally)  on  social  norms  and political  change,  especially  in  less  developed  countries;  (5)  how  existing  provisioning  systems  and social  practices  destabilise  through  the  weakening  of  various  lock-in  mechanisms,  and  resulting deliberate  strategies  for  accelerating  demand-side  transitions;  (6)  a  dynamic  understanding  of feasibility, which addresses the dynamic mechanisms that lower barriers or drive mitigation options over the barriers. (7) how shocks like prolonged pandemic impacts willingness and capacity to change and their permanency for various social actors and country contexts. The debate on the most powerful leverage point/s and policies for speeding up change in social and technological systems need to be resolved with more evidence. Discussion on the policy interdependence and implications of end-user and efficiency focused strategies have only just started suggesting an important area for future research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) FAQ 5.1 What can every person do to limit warming to 1.5°C?  People can be educated through knowledge transfer so they can act in different roles, and in each role everyone can contribute to limit global warming to 1.5°C. As citizens,  with enough knowledge  can organise and put political pressure on the system. Role models can set examples to others. Professionals (e.g., engineers, urban planners, teachers, researchers) can change professional standards in consistency with decarbonisation; e.g., urban planners and architects can design physical infrastructures to facilitate low-carbon mobility and energy use by making walking and cycling safe for children. Rich investors can make strategic plan to divest from fossils and invest in carbon-neutral technologies. As consumers, especially  if  one  belongs  to  the  top  10%  of  the  world  population  in  terms  of  income,  can  limit consumption, especially in mobility, and explore the good life consistent with sustainable consumption. Policy makers support individual actions in certain contexts  not only by economic incentives, such as carbon pricing, but also by interventions that understand complex decision making processes, habits, and routines. Examples of such interventions  include but are not limited to choice architectures and nudges that set green options as default, shift away from cheap petrol or gasoline, increasing taxes on carbon-intensive products, or substantially tightening regulations and standards support shifts in social norms, and thus can be effective beyond the direct economic incentive. FAQ 5.2 How does society perceive transformative change? Human induced global warming, together with other global trends and events, such as digitalisation and automation,  and  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  induces  changes  in  labour  markets,  and  bring  large uncertainty  and  ambiguity.  History  and  psychology  reveal  that  societies  can  thrive  in  these circumstances  if  they  openly  embrace  uncertainty  on  the  future  and  try  out  ways  to  improve  life. Tolerating ambiguity can be learned, e.g., by interacting with history, poetry and the arts. Sometimes religion and philosophy also help.  Page 108
  specify that even as speed and capabilities differ humanity embarks on a joint journey towards  well-being for all and a healthy planet. FAQ 5.3 Is demand reduction compatible with growth of human well-being? There is a growing realisation that mere monetary value of income growth is insufficient to measure national welfare and individual well-being. Hence, any action towards climate change mitigation is best evaluated against a set of indicators that represent a broader variety of needs to define individual well-being, macroeconomic stability, and planetary health. Many solutions that reduce primary material and fossil energy demand, and thus reduce GHG emissions, provide better services to help achieve well-being for all. Economic growth measured by total or individual income growth is a main driver of GHG emissions. Only a few countries with low economic growth rates have reduced both territorial and consumption-based  GHG  emissions  from,  typically  by  switching  from  fossil  fuels  to  renewable  energy  and  by reduction in energy low/zero carbon fuels, but until now at insufficient rates and levels for stabilising global warming at 1.5°C. High deployment of low/zero carbon fuels and associated rapid reduction in demand and use of coal, gas, and oil can further reduce the interdependence between economic growth and GHG emissions.  5-107  Total pages: 192Page 109
