*Work of 03.06.2022

*What did I do?
  Cloned pdf2txt.py in GitBash Terminal
  Downloaded the IPCC report in pdf format from web.
  Run the following commands in the terminal
     mkdir Chapter01
     cp Chapter01.pdf Chapter01/fulltext.pdf
     cd Chapter01
     pdf2txt.py -o fulltext.txt fulltext.pdf 
     ls
     fulltext.pdf	fulltext.txt
     
     If you do not get fulltext.txt after running the ls command then, install pdfminer.six and execute the following commads in the Command Prompt:

    cd pdfminer.six
    python tools/pdf2txt.py "Copy path.pdf" -o "Copy path.txt"
    
  *What are the results?
   A folder was created names Chapter04 in the path specified in Terminal. 2 files named Chapter04 were saved. One in .pdf format & another in .txt format.
   
   *What do they mean?
   This means the pdf2txt works perfectly in Windows11, 8GB RAM environment and the code used here has successfully converted the pdf file to fulltext.
   It saved both of the copies in the specified folder.
   
   *Are there any errors or problems?
   The pdf has numbered lines. The txt file first converts the number of the lines and then converts the text. So, it becomes jumbled up. The same thing happens for
   tables and diagrams of the pdf.
