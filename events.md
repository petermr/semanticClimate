### Summary
IPCC/AR6/WG3 (Climate Change and Mitigations) was published in 2022-April. We had a group of volunteers and interns at NIPGR in place and switched our emphasis to making a semantic version incorporating our Open ideas, code, material and protocols. We were invited to submit a project for the UN-University-of-Geneva Piaget Hackathon in 2022-June which was won by our group of young interns led by Shweata N Hegde (Mysuru). 
 
We intend to develop this as a flexible, extensible series of re-usable workshops ("Learning by Doing"), and Saturday 2022-09-24 was therefore the first time we released the system for use outside the group!

The "hack" set out to answer many questions:
* is #semanticClimate knowledge likely to be useful?
* can citizens from a wide range of backgrounds (policy makers, libraries, researchers, coders, climate specialists, etc.) understand and use it?
* what are the most useful future directions? Can it be extended?
* does LearningByDoing work for the participants?
* who else should the group link up with, politically and technically?
* does the workshop/hack format (in-depth instructions and guided hands-on) work? 
* did the technology work?

Some objective findings:
* About 85 people registered which delighted us. 
* We committed to going at a pace where everyone got a chance to "press the buttons".
* We wanted to show the delegates the great interest and support from policy makers and funders (Principal Scientific Adviser GoI, UNDP, Delhi Knowledge Cluster, etc.)

## TIGR2ESS Symposium
## Participated in Piaget Hackathon
- GitHub Thread maintained during the Event: https://github.com/petermr/petermr/discussions/37

The team participated in the event to hack IPCC Reports. 

The team eventually won. They plan on hosting more hackathons themselves where the participants explore the IPCC Reports and our technology. These are called Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon.
